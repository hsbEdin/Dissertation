      "ABSTRACT [A clinical trial to determine whether intravenous aminophylline is indispensable in the treatment of status asthmaticus].In Japan, intravenous aminophylline (AMP) is considered as the first treatment of choice for status asthmaticus, whereas inhaled beta 2-agonist is considered to be of no value for acute severe asthma. To determine the optimal therapy for acute asthma, the authors clinically investigated bronchodilating effects and the clinical role of aerosolized beta 2-agonist inhalation and intravenous AMP in 55 patients with status asthmaticus. Patients were classified into two groups treated without intubation and with artificial ventilation. Intravenous steroid (equivalent to 4 mg/kg of hydrocortisone) was administered in all cases. Further, all patients were randomly divided into two subgroups according to treatment regimen, i.e. repeated inhalation of aerosolized beta 2-agonists only, and combined with intravenous AMP. In all groups, the duration of treatment was significantly shorter in the subgroups treated with repeated aerosolized beta 2-agonist inhalation than those treated with intravenous AMP. The failure of intravenous AMP to effect more rapid or profound improvement both in objective and subjective parameters suggested that inhaled beta 2-agonist with intravenous steroid should be a rational choice in the initial treatment of acute asthma. Moreover, inhaled beta 2-agonist used optimally produces good bronchodilation several times greater than that produced by intravenous AMP. We concluded that repeated inhalation of aerosolized beta 2-agonists is the drug of choice combined with intravenous steroid regardless of the severity of attacks for short-term therapy of acute severe asthma, and that intravenous AMP may have only minor bronchodilating effects.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Protection against allergen-induced asthma by salmeterol.The effects of the long-acting beta 2-agonist salmeterol on early and late phase airways events provoked by inhaled allergen were assessed in a group of atopic asthmatic patients. In a placebo-controlled study, salmeterol 50 micrograms inhaled before allergen challenge ablated both the early and late phase of allergen-induced bronchoconstriction over a 34 h time period. Salmeterol also completely inhibited the allergen-induced rise in non-specific bronchial responsiveness over the same time period. These effects were shown to be unrelated to prolonged bronchodilatation or functional antagonism. These data suggest novel actions for topically active long-acting beta 2-agonists in asthma that extend beyond their protective action on airways smooth muscle.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Use of antiasthmatic drugs in Australia.Bronchodilator prescription and sales data for Australia from 1975 to 1986 were analysed. Inhaled beta-agonists were the most commonly prescribed antiasthmatic agents in 1986, followed by sustained-release theophylline and inhaled corticosteroids. Marked increases in prescription sales of these three drug groups over the period were noted. We estimate that non-prescription sales of salbutamol inhalers increased by 410% between 1980 and 1986 (P less than 0.01). Prescribing rates by general practitioners for beta-agonists, sustained-release theophylline and inhaled corticosteroids increased from 1979 to 1986. Prescribing rates of beta-agonists were highest for persons aged 1-11 years and 55 years and over, and increased markedly for children aged 1-11 years over the period. For sustained-release theophylline, prescribing rates were highest for persons 55 years and over. The difficulties in postulating possible relationships between prescribing trends and asthma mortality are discussed.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Formoterol, a new inhaled beta-2 adrenergic agonist, has a longer blocking effect than albuterol on hyperventilation-induced bronchoconstriction.The duration of effect of inhaled formoterol (24 micrograms) was compared with that of a placebo and that of inhaled albuterol (200 micrograms) in 12 adult asthmatic subjects who underwent hyperventilation tests with cold dry air (-20 degrees C) on 4 study days. On the control day, they were subjected to four hyperventilation tests to ensure functional stability. On the 3 remaining days, after a first hyperventilation test, they inhaled placebo, albuterol, or formoterol in randomized, double-blind fashion. The hyperventilation test was repeated 1, 4, and 8 h and, if the blocking effect was still present, 12 and 24 h after the drug had been administered. The dose of hyperventilation of cold air causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PD20) was interpolated on the dose-response curve. The magnitude of the blocking effect at each time interval on each study day was assessed by comparing the changes in PD20 from baseline with the within-day variability of PD20 (standardized change in PD20). The acute bronchodilator effect was not significantly different as assessed 15 min (21 +/- 14% for albuterol and 18 +/- 18% for formoterol) and 1 h (20 +/- 13% for albuterol and 18 +/- 17% for formoterol) after administering the medication. The duration of the blocking effect, defined as the return to 2 SD from the standardized change in PD20, was significantly more prolonged for formoterol (8.0 +/- 3.4 h) than for albuterol (3.0 +/- 1.7 h) (t = 4.2, p less than 0.0001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "ABSTRACT The beta-adrenergic system in man: physiological and pathophysiological response. Regulation of receptor density and functioning.Catecholamines play an essential role in the activation of the cardiovascular system and in the regulation of energy metabolism in a variety of physiological conditions. Many of these effects are mediated through beta-adrenoceptors located on cell membranes. Binding of catecholamines to beta-adrenoceptor increases the concentration of intracellular cyclic AMP which in turn activates protein kinase A. This enzyme phosphorylates a number of other intracellular enzymes influencing cell metabolism and functions. The primary structures of the receptor and its topography in the cell membrane as well as its binding domains have been partially clarified. In studies of the human beta-adrenergic receptors blood lymphocytes have mostly been used as model cells. These cells carry receptors of mainly the beta 2-subtype. The adequacy of this model system has been demonstrated in several studies. In clinical work receptor assays have had limited use until now. However, studies on the pathophysiology of the adrenergic system in several diseases have revealed that receptor alterations may constitute an important factor in the disease process. Measurements of adrenergic receptors may also have increasing usefulness in determining optimal drug concentrations. Our own studies have primarily focused on physiological adjustments in the beta-adrenergic system during acute or prolonged physical exercise as well as receptor changes in heart failure, muscle diseases and the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. We have also explored receptor dynamics during therapy with beta-blocking agents. These studies, briefly reviewed in this communication, have led to the following conclusions: (1) High aerobic capacity is associated with an increased density and ability of lymphocytic beta-adrenoceptors to respond to catecholamines. (2) Both short-and long-term physical exercise induce a rapid up-regulation and more effective functioning of lymphocytic beta-adrenoceptors. (3) Administration of beta-blocking drugs is associated with a subnormal exercise-induced up-regulation and decreased functioning of the lymphocytic beta-adrenoceptors. (4) The exercise-provoked up-regulation and improved functioning of beta-adrenoceptors is blunted in heart failure patients. (5) Patients with Duchenne-type of muscular dystrophy have a reduced number of lymphocytic beta-adrenoceptors. (6) In chronic alcoholics the lymphocytic beta-adrenoceptor level is subnormal but during abrupt ethanol withdrawal a rapid increase in the number and functioning of the receptors to a normal level takes place. This sequence of events may lead to a condition of relative adrenergic hypersensitivity.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Regular inhaled beta-agonist treatment in bronchial asthma.89 subjects with stable asthma took part in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover study of the effects of regular versus on-demand inhaled bronchodilator therapy. The subjects inhaled fenoterol or placebo by a dry powder delivery system for 24 weeks. Control of asthma was judged by daily morning and evening peak expiratory flow rates, symptom diaries, use of additional inhaled bronchodilator, and requirement for short courses of prednisone. Of 64 subjects who completed the trial, 57 showed a clear difference in degree of control of asthma between the fenoterol and placebo periods: in 17 (30% [95% confidence interval 18.4-43.4%]) asthma was better controlled during regular inhaled bronchodilator treatment, whereas in 40 (70% [56.6-81.6%]) control was better during placebo treatment with bronchodilator for symptom relief only. Mean airway responsiveness to methacholine increased slightly during the fenoterol period. The adverse effect of regular bronchodilator inhalation occurred not only among subjects who used a bronchodilator as sole treatment (2 were better and 10 were worse during regular bronchodilator treatment) but also among those who took inhaled corticosteroids (14 were better and 29 were worse). Thus, regular inhalation of a beta-sympathomimetic agent was associated with deterioration of asthma control in the majority of subjects. The trends to use of regular, higher doses or longer-acting inhaled beta-sympathomimetic treatment may be an important causal factor in the worldwide increase in morbidity from asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Bronchodilator, cardiovascular, and hypokalaemic effects of fenoterol, salbutamol, and terbutaline in asthma.The airway response and cardiovascular and hypokalaemic effects of fenoterol, salbutamol, and terbutaline given in multiples of standard doses from metered-dose inhalers were studied in ten patients with mild asthma. In a double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study the subjects received 2, 6, and 18 puffs of each drug with intervals of 90 min, and forced expiratory volume in 1 s, heart rate, QTc interval, plasma potassium concentration, tremor, and bronchial reactivity to histamine were measured. All three drugs produced similar bronchodilatation. However, the rises in heart rate, QTc interval, and tremor and the fall in plasma potassium were greater after fenoterol than after salbutamol or terbutaline. The maximum mean (SD) increases in heart rate for fenoterol, salbutamol, and terbutaline were 29 (24) bpm, 8 (9) bpm, and 8 (14) bpm, respectively; falls in plasma potassium were 0.76 (0.62) mmol/l, 0.46 (0.32) mmol/l, and 0.52 (0.39) mmol/l, respectively. Fenoterol afforded no additional protection against histamine compared with salbutamol. These findings suggest that at doses based on those used in clinical practice fenoterol causes more adverse effects than salbutamol or terbutaline. The most likely explanation for these effects is that fenoterol has been marketed at a higher dose than the other beta 2-agonists; fenoterol may in addition be less selective for beta 2 receptors.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Use of inhaled corticosteroids in patients with mild asthma.A double blind, parallel group study was carried out to investigate the effect of inhaled budesonide in a moderate (200 micrograms) and a low (100 micrograms) twice daily dosage compared with the effect of placebo in 103 adults with mild symptomatic asthma. Subjects recorded peak expiratory flow (PEF), asthma symptoms, and beta 2 agonist consumption at home for a period of seven weeks (a one week run in and six weeks' treatment). Morning baseline PEF (around 80% of predicted normal) increased non-significantly to 88% with 200 micrograms budesonide daily and to 90% (p less than 0.05) with 400 micrograms, compared with 81% with placebo. Evening PEF (around 94% of predicted normal) did not change significantly with active or placebo treatment. By comparison with placebo, there was a significant decrease in nocturnal asthma symptoms and beta 2 agonist consumption. The changes during the day were less pronounced and significant only for 400 micrograms budesonide daily. No significant differences between the two active treatments were detected. It is concluded that low doses of inhaled budesonide are effective in patients with mild symptomatic asthma, particularly for night time symptoms and early morning lung function. The early introduction of inhaled corticosteroids for patients with mild asthma and night time symptoms may improve their quality of life during the night and early morning.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Prophylactic treatment of grass pollen-induced asthma with cetirizine.In a double-blind randomized parallel-group study, six investigators enrolled 43 subjects to study the prophylactic effect of 10 mg cetirizine b.i.d. on grass pollen-induced asthma. The control group received 60 mg b.i.d. terfenadine, given to avoid withdrawals from the trial because of hay fever symptoms. Subjects were included in the study between the appearance of the first symptoms of hay fever and those of pollen-induced asthma. The hay fever and asthma symptoms, visual analogue scores (VAS), FEV1 and self-assessment data on complaints, salvage treatment and peak-flow values were statistically analysed. Both treatments were well tolerated, with a low and similar incidence of side-effects. During the last 3 weeks of treatment, six (32%) of the 19 subjects on cetirizine who were evaluable for efficacy remained free of asthma complaints, and another two (10%) had only a single minor attack. None had a grade 3 (incapacitating) attack. Conversely, only one (5%) of the 20 evaluable subjects on terfenadine remained complaint free, and all others (95%) had multiple attacks, which incapacitated three (15%) of them. Nasal obstruction, dyspnoea, morning peak flow, consumption of beta 2-mimetics and an efficacy index on asthma, combining complaints and rescue drug consumption, were significantly better on cetirizine (P less than 0.05). It is concluded that cetirizine is able to prevent the exacerbation of asthma induced by grass pollen.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Sympathomimetics for acute severe asthma: should only beta 2-selective agonists be used?Sympathomimetics have become a mainstay of the treatment of acute asthma. Aerosolization of sympathomimetics provides as great or greater bronchodilation in acute severe asthma with fewer systemic effects than parenteral therapy. Despite the broncho-selectivity achieved with this route of administration, cardiostimulation remains the major, dose-limiting factor in the safe use of sustained, high-dose therapy with these agents. This article reviews the pharmacology, adverse effects, and toxicities of selected beta agonists, as well as clinical studies relevant to the question posed in the title. Although the ideal study to answer this question has not yet been performed, the authors feel that available evidence supports the preferential use of selective beta 2 agonists in patients with acute, severe asthma who will require high doses of beta agonists.\n",

Seven patients showed clinical improvement by the third month (41%) and even a greater one by the sixth month, only very slight symptoms persisting thereafter. In three cases (17.6%) there was no improvement after two years of outcome of asthma and the persistence or not of pathological between the outcome of asthma and the persistence or not of pathological 24-hour pHmetry. On the contrary. macroscopic oesophagitis disappeared in the cases of asthma with good outcome, but persisted in all the cases who remained symptomatic.

      "ABSTRACT Cetirizine. A review of its pharmacological properties and clinical potential in allergic rhinitis, pollen-induced asthma, and chronic urticaria.Cetirizine, a piperazine derivative and carboxylated metabolite of hydroxyzine, is a potent histamine H1-receptor antagonist with antiallergic properties. It has marked affinity for peripheral histamine H1-receptors and, at the standard dose of 10mg daily, lacks the CNS depressant effects of standard antihistamines. In addition, it inhibits histamine release and eosinophil chemotaxis during the secondary phase of the allergic response. Results from controlled clinical trials indicate that cetirizine is an effective and well tolerated treatment of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria. Cetirizine appears to be as effective as conventional dosages of terfenadine, chlorpheniramine and hydroxyzine in relieving symptoms associated with these disorders and produces a markedly lower incidence of sedation than chlorpheniramine, hydroxyzine and several other standard antihistamines. Thus, cetirizine appears to provide a useful alternative to other 'nonsedating' antihistamines; cetirizine may also have a future role in the treatment of allergic asthma and certain forms of physical urticaria.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Effects of treatment on airway microvascular leakage.Microvascular leakage, an essential component of inflammation, probably plays a critical role in asthma in producing plasma exudation and thickening of the bronchial mucosa which may underlie airway hyperresponsiveness. Several therapeutic approaches are possible to reduce this leakage, by blocking either the effects or the release of inflammatory mediators which induce the leakage. Drugs with these actions might be too specific to be of therapeutic value if many mediators are involved, as seems increasingly likely. Reduction of blood flow using selective vasoconstrictors is a more attractive approach and alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonists may be of value. Drugs that act directly on endothelial cells are probably the most useful, since they would be effective irrespective of the mechanism of leakage. Corticosteroids probably have this property, but whether beta-agonists or theophylline are clinically effective against airway microvascular leakage is not yet certain. The development of new drugs which can inhibit microvascular leakage is an important therapeutic approach for the future.\n",

Evaluation of bronchodilation is still debated. When single dose of drug is administered, nycthemeral rhythm, baseline pulmonary function are to be taken in account. In case of long term treatment studies, evaluation of the effects is based upon clinical score, sequential pulmonary function tests, morning and evening peak expiratory flow rates. Risks way be related to be related to beta 2 drugs or concomitant therapy or associated pathology. Indications of dose and route administration are related to asthma severity.

Two comparable groups of nonatopic asthmatic adults (n = 24), aged between 16 and 66 years (42 +/- 17), were investigated in a crossed, randomized study. After 4 weeks with procaterol + 800 micrograms of budesonide, the forced expiratory flow improved (p less than 0.01), the degree of bronchial hyperreactivity to histamine was reduced (p less than 0.001), the daily recorded symptomatology almost disappeared in all and the number of procaterol inhalations was reduced (p less than 0.05). The combination of theophylline + procaterol during 4 weeks did not improve these parameters from their baseline values. It was concluded that inhaled steroids are the drugs of choice in patients with asthma which is not controlled only with beta agonists.\n",

Comparison of HBV-related polyarteritis nodosa and Churg Strauss Angiitis.Levels of immune complexes (IC) were measured before treatment in 16 patients affected with classic polyarteritis nodosa (PN) or Churg Strauss Angiitis (CSA). The six patients with PN were positive for HBV markers. The others presented severe asthma. IgG containing immune complexes were measured using Raji cell assay. Normal level was 4,642 +/- 509 (mean +/- SEM). IC levels were significantly different in patients with and without HBV markers. When HBV was present, mean IC level was 7,185 +/- 2,472. In the absence of HBV markers, mean IC level was 26,462 +/- 10,796. These results confirm that systemic vasculitis is an heterogeneous group of diseases and further suggest that pathogenesis of vasculitis is different in patients with asthma and those with HBV markers.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Observations with tinset tablet in allergic respiratory tract diseases.The effect of Tinset tablet (30 mg oxatomide) has been examined in 68 patients suffering from allergic diseases of the upper respiratory tract or from allergic diseases accidentally accompanying different pulmonary diseases. In general the daily doses were 2 x 1 tab., occasionally 2 x 2 tab., a number of 12-16-year old patients received only 1 tab. daily. On the basis of the clinical symptoms, spirometric examinations, and global evaluation it has been concluded that the drug may be used most successfully in seasonal rhinitis, allergodermatosis, and allergic conjunctivitis cases and in extrinsic allergic asthma of children. The therapeutic effectiveness of the drug is insignificant in perennial rhinitis and adult extrinsic asthma cases. The somnolence-inducing effect of the drug is notable (it developed in 50% of the patients). In 23 of the 68 patients weight-gain, in 3 cases each gastric complaint or dryness of mouth developed.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Controlled trial of a home and ambulatory program for asthmatic children.Care of asthmatic children is often episodic and more therapeutic than preventive. A 2-year randomized, controlled trial involving 95 children measured the impact of a comprehensive home and ambulatory program for pediatric asthma management using objective outcome measures. Interventions for the study group during the first year included 3-month clinic visits, education, and home visits by a specially trained research nurse. Control subjects continued to receive regular care from a family physician or pediatrician. Eight-nine subjects (93%) completed the study. Study subjects had less school absenteeism than control subjects (10.7 vs. 16.0 days, P = .04) and showed significantly better small airway function after 1 year. Asthma severity improved in 13 study subjects and worsened in 5. The reverse was true for control subjects. Study subjects exhibited better metered aerosol technique than control subjects (P = .0005). Fewer days were spent in hospital by the study subjects admitted compared with control subjects (3.67 vs 11.2 days, P = .02). After 1 year, more study than control families (72.1% vs 33.1%, P = .006) reported that their asthmatic child took responsibility for the asthma management. The intervention failed to reduce exposure to secondhand smoke or to household pets. There were no significant differences in medical visits, theophylline levels, or records of asthma symptoms. One year after discontinuing the intervention, a marked \"washout\" effect was observed. Comprehensive ambulatory programs of childhood asthma management can improve objective measures of illness severity but must be sustained.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Metered dose inhalers for bronchodilator delivery in intubated, mechanically ventilated patients.We determined the relative efficacy of two bronchodilator aerosol delivery methods in 18 intubated mechanically ventilated patients with airways obstruction. Two treatment arms, consisting of albuterol 270 micrograms (three puffs) from a metered dose inhaler and albuterol 2.5 mg from a saline solution nebulized with an updraft inhaler, were compared in a single blind, randomized crossover design. Pulmonary function was evaluated using an interrupter technique. Changes in passive expiratory flow at respiratory system recoil pressures between 6 and 10 cm H2O provided the therapeutic endpoints. Paired measurements were made before and 30 minutes after drug delivery. The MDI and NEB resulted in similar improvements in iso-recoil flow (mean increase for both groups = 0.1 L/s). Treatment sequence, severity of obstruction, and bronchodilator responsiveness had no effect on relative efficacy. Albuterol caused a small but significant increase in heart rate that was similar following both delivery methods. We conclude that bronchodilator aerosol delivery with metered dose inhalers provides a viable alternative to nebulizer therapy in intubated mechanically ventilated patients and may result in a cost savings to hospitals and patients.\n",

In all patients, the dose of methacholine causing an FEV1 fall of 15% (PD15) was determined at baseline, 24 h before allergen challenge. Methacholine bronchial challenge was repeated 1 h before BAL-BL in patients of both groups and again 12 to 14 h after BAL-BL in Group A and 24 h after BAL-BL in Group B. In patients of Group A, the values of methacholine PD15 after BAL-BL were not significantly different from those determined before BAL-BL. This was also the case in patients in whom bronchial responsiveness was increased after allergen challenge. In patients of Group B, methacholine PD15 was significantly decreased after allergen challenge, and this decrease was correlated with the occurrence and the severity of the late asthmatic reaction. Even in patients who showed dual asthmatic reactions and an increased responsiveness after allergen challenge, methacholine PD15 was not further decreased after BAL-BL. These data support the safety of a procedure combining bronchial allergen challenge with BAL-BL, which can be used for studies on the pathophysiology of bronchial asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The effect of inhaled corticosteroids on the maximal degree of airway narrowing to methacholine in asthmatic subjects.Airway hyperresponsiveness in asthma is characterized by an increase in sensitivity and in maximal response to airway-narrowing stimuli. Long-term therapy with inhaled corticosteroids is known to reduce airway hypersensitivity in asthmatic patients. To investigate whether these drugs also reduce the maximal degree of airway narrowing we studied the effects of inhaled budesonide on the maximal response plateau of the dose-response curve to inhaled methacholine in mildly asthmatic patients in whom a raised plateau could be measured. Sixteen atopic patients with mild asthma were placed randomly into two parallel treatment groups to receive double-blindly either budesonide (400 micrograms twice daily) or placebo, inhaled via a Turbuhaler, for 4 wk. Before treatment, after 2 and 4 wk of treatment, and after 2 and 4 wk of wash-out, complete dose-response curves to methacholine were obtained using a standardized 2-min tidal breathing method. The response was measured by FEV1, expressed in % fall from baseline. A plateau on the log dose-response curve was considered if three or more data points fell within a 5% response range. The maximal response was obtained by averaging the values on the plateau (MFEV1), and the sensitivity was calculated from the provocative concentration of methacholine, causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20). After 4 wk of budesonide treatment, mean MFEV1 decreased from 41.6 to 33.7% fall (p = 0.0004). The changes in MFEV1 were significantly different between placebo and budesonide (p = 0.03). The geometric mean PC20 increased from 3.4 to 6.3 mg/ml (p = 0.02), but the changes in PC20 were not different between the two groups (p = 0.23).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "ABSTRACT Thromboxane A2 biosynthesis in acute asthma and after antigen challenge.Thromboxane A2 is a potent bronchial smooth muscle spasmogen in vitro, and it has been implicated in airway inflammation and in the genesis of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in asthma. We have examined the urinary excretion of a variety of products derived from thromboxane A2 (thromboxane B2, 2,3-dinor, and 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2) and prostacyclin (6-oxo-PGF1 alpha and 2,3-dinor-6-oxo-PGF1 alpha) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in patients admitted acutely to hospital with severe asthma and in atopic volunteers after bronchial antigen challenge. Urinary excretion of all thromboxane-derived products was markedly increased in a number of patients with severe acute asthma compared with that in a nonsmoking control population, in some cases approaching those previously described in myocardial infarction: TXB2, 31.6 +/- 12.0 versus 6.5 +/- 0.9; 2,3-dinor-TXB2, 79.0 +/- 19.2 versus 29.5 +/- 2.7; and 11-dehydro-TXB2, 234.3 +/- 65.3 versus 25.0 +/- 2.1 ng/mmol creatinine (p less than 0.001). Urinary prostacyclin-derived products were also significantly raised in acute asthma. In contrast, after inhaled allergen challenge in atopic volunteers, which caused significant bronchoconstriction, urinary excretion of thromboxane-derived products was not significantly elevated: TXB2, 5.6 +/- 1.1 versus 5.7 +/- 1.0; 2,3-dinor-TXB2, 41.2 +/- 12.5 versus 28.5 +/- 6.9; and 11-dehydro-TXB2, 69.8 +/- 17.6 versus 39.7 +/- 11.2 ng/mmol creatinine. In a separate experiment, less than 2% of exogenously administered TXB2 to the airway appeared as urinary thromboxane-derived products, suggesting that production of greater than or equal to 1 microgram of TXA2 in vivo would be required to increase urinary thromboxane excretion twofold.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

Bronchioles of asthmatic subjects had an increased amount of lumen occlusion (p less than 0.01), smooth muscle thickness (p less than 0.001), and inflammatory infiltrate (p less than 0.001), and both mononuclear cells and eosinophils contributed to this increased inflammation. The muscular pulmonary arteries adjacent to occluded and inflamed bronchioles did not have the morphologic features of chronic hypoxia, as shown by the normal medial and intimal thickness, but they had an important inflammatory process in their walls that was particularly marked at sites adjacent to airways.

We wished to determine whether the differences in asthma mortality between New Zealand and Canada were reflected in different patterns of emergency room use or physician management. Emergency room use during the past decade was enumerated in both hospitals, and charts containing the sole diagnosis of asthma were reviewed in detail for a defined study period in 1986. In both Toronto and Auckland, the number of emergency visits for asthma had increased significantly in the past decade (P less than .015 but the rate of rise was significantly higher in Auckland (P less than .05). In Auckland, 27% of asthmatics were admitted whereas in Toronto significantly fewer (16%) were admitted (P less than .0005). Objective measures of pulmonary function were documented more frequently by emergency room physicians in New Zealand than in Canada (90% versus 48%; P less than .0005). Pulmonary function measurement was primarily by peak flow meter in Auckland and most commonly by spirometer in Toronto so that pulmonary function measurements could not be compared directly between centers. In both centers, however, admitted patients had significantly lower pulmonary function indices than discharged patients. In New Zealand, mean peak flow was 38% of the predicted value among all asthmatics assessed; in Toronto, mean FEV1 was 47% of predicted. In Toronto, pulmonary function measurements were most likely to be missing among presumably healthier discharged patients.

A detailed history was obtained, and skin tests were performed. Male predominance and an early age of onset were confirmed. Symptomatic allergic rhinitis was an extremely common finding. A family history of allergy was obtained in over 90% of cases. Respiratory tract infections, changes in the weather and exercise were found to be the most common asthma-inducing factors. Common allergens were grass pollen (63%) and animal danders. House-dust mite (25%) and dietary allergens (less than 20%) were relatively uncommon. The failure to recognise the symptoms of asthma in children, particularly young children, was identified as an ongoing problem.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Asthma and chronic obstructive lung disease: a pharmacologic approach.Changing concepts are emerging that should improve our ability to adequately treat asthma. This volume of Disease-a-Month reviews the triggers and the role of inflammation in asthma, and outlines the treatment of acute asthma as well as the chronic management of reversible obstructive airways disease. There is general agreement that sympathomimetics are the treatment of choice for acute severe asthma. The role of theophylline for acute symptoms has been downplayed, and the role of corticosteroids continues to be debated. However, most authorities agree that patients with severe asthma will benefit from the addition of corticosteroids to the program. For the chronic management of asthma, appreciation that inflammation is a perpetuating feature suggests that treatment should generally be directed toward the inflammation. Corticosteroid aerosols have taken on greater prominence and have been advocated as the first line of approach. New concepts regarding the role of allergy in the perpetuation of asthma and the role of immunotherapy in its amelioration also have emerged. Medications not previously thought to be beneficial are being actively investigated. They include gold, methotrexate, and even intravenous gamma globulin.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The normal range of diurnal changes in peak expiratory flow rates. Relationship to symptoms and respiratory disease.Measuring peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) several times a day can provide an objective assessment of functional changes relative to environmental or occupational exposures. This report describes the pattern of diurnal changes in PEFR in a reference population, and defines ranges of \"normal\" between- and within-day variability. An index of diurnal changes was defined as the ratio between maximal and minimal values, where the maximal value was restricted to PEFR measured at noon or in the evening (N, E) and the minimal value was restricted to the morning or at bedtime (M, B). A ratio greater than normal represented an exaggeration of the normal diurnal pattern in PEFR. Normal limits, based on the ninety-fifth percentile in the reference population, were larger for children (130%) than for adults 15 to 35 yr of age (117%) and those older than 35 yr of age (118%). The meaningfulness of excessive diurnal changes in PEFR was examined by relating this ratio (Max/Min), and a similar measure (the amplitude percent mean) to chronic respiratory symptoms and diseases in 938 adults and children who recorded PEFR values 2 to 4 times per day for as long as 14 days. There was a strong relationship of diurnal changes in PEFR that exceed normal limits with physician-confirmed asthma (relative risk of 2.99 with Max/Min), with exertional dyspnea (Grade 2+), and with more frequent reporting of acute symptoms of wheeze, attacks of wheezing dyspnea, cough, and chest colds. In addition, those exceeding the normal limits had about 2.9 times greater risk of having a FEV1 below 80% of predicted, and nearly 7 times greater risk of being below 70%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "ABSTRACT Allergen-induced asthmatic responses. Relationship between increases in airway responsiveness and increases in circulating eosinophils, basophils, and their progenitors.The inflammatory response during allergen-induced asthma was assessed using serial measures of peripheral blood eosinophils (Eo), basophils (B), and Eo/B progenitor cells (Eo/B-CFU). A group of 14 stable asthmatic individuals (beta 2-agonists only as needed) had inhalation provocation tests with allergen (18 tests in total) and with diluent. Serial blood samples were taken before and 1 and 24 h after the tests; methylcellulose cultures for Eo/B-CFU and granulocyte-macrophage (GM-CFU) were scored at 14 days. Circulating Eo, B, and Eo/B-CFU were increased at 24 h after allergen inhalation when this resulted in increased histamine airway responsiveness (n = 13). In the 5 subjects with isolated early asthmatic responses the Eo, B, and Eo/B-CFU counts did not change. There was no change in the GM-CFU after allergen. The ratio change in circulating Eo/B-CFU was negatively correlated with baseline histamine airway responsiveness (r = -0.8, p less than 0.05). Four subjects who had an isolated early response and no blood changes to one allergen developed an increase in histamine airway responsiveness and an increase in Eo, B, and Eo/B progenitors after inhalation of a second different allergen. The results indicate that in subjects with an allergen-induced increase in histamine airway responsiveness, an inflammatory response occurs that includes an increase in the number of Eo/B progenitors. This response, possibly mediated by Eo/B growth and differentiation factors, could lead to the accumulation of these cells in the airway and contribute to the airways inflammation present in asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Asthma in the elderly. A comparison between patients with recently acquired and long-standing disease.To characterize asthma in the elderly, 25 consecutive nonsmoking pulmonary clinic patients over the age of 70 who met the American Thoracic Society criteria for asthma were identified. Of these, 12 patients (48%) had developed asthma at an advanced age (greater than 65 yr). This group with late-onset asthma had a mean duration of disease of 5.1 +/- 2.5 yr. The remaining group with early-onset asthma had a mean duration of illness of 31.4 +/- 14.6 yr. On the day of evaluation each patient underwent pulmonary function testing off all medication for at least 12 h. These two groups were indistinguishable by symptoms and medication requirements. Immediate hypersensitivity skin testing to 43 aeroallergens was uniformly negative in all 25 patients but the histamine control was always positive. IgE levels in both groups were not different from those in elderly control subjects. Those with early-onset asthma had a greater likelihood of previous allergic disease (p less than 0.001) and a significantly greater degree of airflow obstruction in pre- and postbronchodilator pulmonary function testing (p less than 0.05). This study suggests that long-standing asthma may lead to chronic persistent airflow obstruction and thereby mimic chronic bronchitis and emphysema (COPD).\n",

      "ABSTRACT Inhalation of an alkaline aerosol by subjects with mild asthma does not result in bronchoconstriction.Although it is recognized that inhalation of acid aerosols by subjects with asthma can cause bronchoconstriction, the effects of the inhalation of an alkaline aerosol are unknown. When supplemental inflatable restraints (automobile air bags) are deployed an alkaline aerosol is released. This aerosol is composed of particles of sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate with some sodium hydroxide. The mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of the aerosol is approximately 1 micron, and the pH of the aerosol is 9.8 to 10.3. A group of 14 volunteer male subjects with mild asthma inhaled increasing concentrations of this aerosol for 20-min periods of mouth-only tidal ventilation. Pulmonary function tests were performed at baseline (preexposure), after inhalation of room air alone (control), and after each period of inhalation of the aerosol. A total of 5 subjects inhaled aerosols at nominal concentrations of 10, 20, and 40 mg/m3, whereas 11 subjects inhaled aerosols concentrations of approximately 30, 60, and 120 mg/m3. The mean changes in FEV1 and specific airways resistance (SRaw) for the 11 subjects who inhaled the higher concentrations (average highest concentration 126.6 +/- 7.5 mg/m3, mean +/- SEM) were -1.4 +/- 1.9 and +17.5 +/- 8.5%, respectively. Neither change in lung function was clinically or statistically significant. We conclude that the inhalation of relatively high concentrations of this alkaline aerosol by subjects with mild asthma does not result in bronchoconstriction.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Airways inflammation in nocturnal asthma.Nocturnal asthma is a frequent problem, but the mechanism is unclear. We investigated the possibility that airways inflammation occurred during the night. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was analyzed in asthmatic patients with (n = 7) and without nocturnal asthma (n = 7) at 1600 and 0400 h. The nocturnal asthma group had an increase in the total leukocyte count (24.0 +/- 7.0 to 41.1 +/- 9.9 x 10(4) cells/ml, p less than 0.05), neutrophils (1.1 +/- 0.6 to 3.7 +/- 1.5 x 10(4) cells/ml, p less than 0.05), and eosinophils (0.5 +/- 0.1 to 1.7 +/- 0.7 x 10(4) cells/ml, p less than 0.05) from 1600 to 0400 h. Cellular components for the non-nocturnal asthma group did not change. Between groups, the 1600-h cells were similar. At 0400 h the nocturnal asthma group had significantly higher total leukocyte, neutrophil, eosinophil, lymphocyte, and epithelial cell counts. For all subjects, the overnight fall in peak expiratory flow rates was correlated to the change in neutrophils (r = 0.54, p less than 0.05) and eosinophils (r = 0.77, p less than 0.05). We conclude that the nocturnal worsening of asthma has an associated cellular inflammatory response that is not seen in patients without overnight decrements in lung function. This inflammatory response together with epithelial damage may be important factors in the etiology of nocturnal asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Respiratory membrane permeability and bronchial hyperreactivity in patients with stable asthma. Effects of therapy with inhaled steroids.In patients with stable asthma, we assayed plasma proteins in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid to obtain information on plasma exudation into the airways. Fourteen nonsmoking patients with asthma who were in a stable period of their disease and eight nonsmoking healthy volunteers were studied. The ratios of the concentrations of albumin, ceruloplasmin (CP), and alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M) between blood and epithelial lining fluid were calculated (cQalb, cQCP, and cQA2M). The cQalb was increased in the patients (Mann-Whitney U test, p less than 0.05). In 10 patients the bronchial hyperreactivity was assessed with histamine provocation tests. Significant relationships between the cQalb, cQCP, and cQA2M on the one hand and PC15 on the other hand were found (Spearman's rank correlation: r = -0.62, p less than 0.05; r = -0.61, p less than 0.05; r = -0.79, p less than 0.01, respectively). Fourteen patients were treated with two inhalations of 200 micrograms glucocorticosteroids per day in a 3-month prospective study. Three of them were excluded from further study because of an intercurrent exacerbation of asthmatic symptoms during therapy. In the 11 patients with stable asthma, the cQalb and cQA2M decreased after treatment with inhaled steroids (Wilcoxon's matched pairs signed rank test, p less than 0.03). Our results show that in patients with stable asthma, there is an increased plasma exudation into the airways, most likely caused by an increased respiratory membrane permeability. The plasma exudation correlated with the bronchial hyperreactivity to histamine, and it decreased after corticosteroid therapy.\n",

A comparison between trachea and bronchus.Tracheal smooth muscle from seven cases of fatal asthma demonstrated an increased contractile response to histamine, acetylcholine, and electrical stimulation of intrinsic cholinergic nerves; impaired relaxation to isoproterenol, and possibly theophylline, was also evident (1). Fourth generation bronchial spirals from the same patients were also studied, and these results were compared with those of the trachea and normal bronchi (n = 5). In contrast to trachea, contractile responses in asthmatic bronchi to acetylcholine, histamine, and cholinergic nerve stimulation were similar to those in control bronchi. The potency of isoprenaline (IC50) was reduced 9.4-fold (p less than 0.003), similar to trachea (4.5-fold), whereas theophylline responses were normal.

The present study was designed to evaluate whether these improvements are maintained when the dose of budesonide is reduced. At the end of the original study, 28 subjects with asthma, who had been in the active-treatment arm of the study were randomized either to continue taking the dose of budesonide taken in the original study or to have the dose reduced. Airway responsiveness to methacholine, bronchodilator requirements, symptoms, and spirometry were assessed after 6 weeks and 3 months. During the 3 months, no subject experienced an asthma exacerbation, and there was no evidence of change in airway responsiveness in subjects who had their steroids reduced (provocative concentration causing a 20% drop in FEV1; initial, 2.03 mg/ml; final, 1.91 mg/ml), and this change was not different from change in subjects maintained with a higher dose (initial, 3.02 mg/ml; final, 3.12 mg/ml) (p = 0.39). Similarly, there was no evidence of any change in bronchodilator requirements (p = 0.89). However, after 3 months of reduced steroid use, there was a small decline in spirometry (FEV1 percent predicted: initial, 84.4%; final, 81.5%), and this change was significantly different from change in subjects in whom steroids were not reduced (initial, 90.2%; final, 90.2%) (p = 0.002).

Dust collected from the CR-infested homes of two patients with asthma from Charlottesville, Va., demonstrated wide variation in the levels of Bla g I, depending on the location of dust collection. Dust from kitchen floors and cabinets contained 50-fold more allergen (mean, 10,755 U/gm of dust) than dust from bedrooms and upholstered furniture (mean, 204 U/gm). One hundred forty-five dust samples were collected from the bedrooms and living rooms of 22 children with asthma and 16 control subjects without asthma living in Atlanta, Ga. Twenty-seven of the 38 homes (17/22 children with asthma; 10/16 control subjects) had detectable Bla g I (4 to 1340 U/gm of dust). Bla g II levels were assayed in 40 kitchen, bedroom, and living room samples from homes in Wilmington, Del. Highest levels of Bla g II were detected in kitchen-floor dust (300 U/gm of dust). Additionally, approximately 20% of homes with no visual evidence of CR infestation had significant levels of Bla g II in at least one dust sample (greater than 4 U/gm of dust). Our results demonstrate that CR may be an occult allergen in homes. The kitchen appears to be the primary site of CR-allergen accumulation, but significant CR-allergen levels can also be found at other sites in the home. The MAb-based assays can be used for quantitation of environmental exposure to CR allergens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "ABSTRACT Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid mediator levels 5 minutes after allergen challenge in atopic subjects with asthma: relationship to the development of late asthmatic responses.Inflammatory mediators have been implicated in the pathogenesis of human asthma and have been demonstrated to increase in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid during the time of the immediate asthmatic response (IAR) after allergen instillation in the lungs. However, the relationship of these mediators, measured early to the late asthmatic response (LAR), airway reactivity, and clinical asthma, is unknown. In the present study, we evaluated mediator levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid before and 5 minutes after allergen challenge from three subject groups: atopic subjects without asthma (N = 7), atopic subjects with asthma and without LAR [-) LAR) (N = 6), and atopic subjects with asthma and with LAR [+) LAR) (N = 6). Subjects with asthma were differentiated into subjects with and without LARs based on at least a 15% decrease in FEV1 between 3 to 8 hours postallergen inhalation. The mediators, prostaglandin D2 thromboxane B2 leukotriene C4 (LTC4), and histamine, were measured both before and after allergen instillation. Baseline prechallenge levels were similar, except in the case of LTC4. LTC4 was detectable at baseline significantly more frequently in the atopic subjects with asthma with and without LAR when these subjects were compared to the atopic subjects without asthma (nine of 12 detectable versus one of seven detectable). In all groups, significant increases in mediator levels were observed in the groups with asthma postallergen challenge, compared to the atopic subjects without asthma. Atopic subjects with asthma and without LAR had significantly higher levels of all four mediators after challenge than atopic subjects with asthma and with LAR and atopic subjects without asthma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

The present investigation compared saline extracts of American cockroach (Periplaneta americana) whole bodies and feces and German cockroach (Blattella germanica) whole bodies and feces as important sources of allergens. All extracts were tested before or after gel filtration on Sephadex G-75 columns (fraction 2) as previously described. Skin test studies of 69 subjects with asthma with extracts of American or German cockroaches demonstrated a significant correlation of reactivity to whole body and fecal extracts for both species. Direct RASTs of 13 sera from cockroach skin test-positive subjects were generally greater to both German whole body extracts (GWBEs) and German fecal extracts (GFEs) as compared to American whole body and fecal extracts. There was a good correlation of RAST reactivity to GWBE with GFE. RAST inhibition demonstrated that GFE contained most of the allergenic activity present in GWBE. These studies demonstrate the allergenic similarities of cockroach whole body and fecal extracts and suggest that cockroach feces are an important sensitizing agent in atopic asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Individualized aerobic and high intensity training for asthmatic children in an exercise readaptation program. Is training always helpful for better adaptation to exercise?In order to define the role of individualized training intensity in a conditioning program for asthmatic children, we have trained seven asthmatics (age = 11.4 +/- 1.8 years) at their ventilatory threshold (VTh) intensity level for a three-month period (aerobic training) and at maximal intensity also for three months (high intensity training). VTh is the point at which a nonlinear increase of VE occurs. Another group of seven asthmatics (age = 11.4 +/- 1.5) served as control subjects. Cardiopulmonary fitness was determined on a cycle ergometer before and after each training session. This study demonstrated that aerobic training, correctly adapted to the child's physical ability, induces the following: (1) a rapid and marked cardiovascular fitness increase; and (2) a decrease in VE over a given work range so that VTh is increased. This is of great importance because hyperventilation is a major determinant of exercise-induced bronchospasm. In contrast, even if high intensity training is well tolerated in an indoor swimming pool, the long-term effects are unsuitable for asthmatic children because the decrease of VTh will involve an increase of hyperventilation, even when exercise is performed at submaximal intensity.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Erythromycin reduces the severity of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in asthma.It has been demonstrated that bronchial hyperresponsiveness is a characteristic feature of bronchial asthma, and airway inflammation plays an important role in bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Erythromycin is an antibiotic extensively used worldwide which is also reported to have anti-inflammatory action. This study was designed to clarify whether erythromycin could favorably alter bronchial responsiveness in patients with bronchial asthma. To estimate bronchial responsiveness, histamine challenge was performed in 23 patients with bronchial asthma (atopic type, 11; nonatopic type, 12). All patients were treated for ten weeks with erythromycin, 200 mg three times daily, orally. After ten weeks' treatment, PC20, an index of bronchial sensitivity, was increased significantly. There was no difference between atopic and nonatopic patients in the improvement of PC20. It was concluded that erythromycin reduces the severity of bronchial responsiveness in patients with bronchial asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Indications for spirometry in outpatients with respiratory disease.It has been suggested that spirometry should be incorporated into the routine examination of every patient, analogous to obtaining vital signs. To determine the impact of spirometry on the management of outpatients with respiratory disease, spirometry was performed on 150 consecutive patients (123 men and 27 women, mean age 57 +/- 12 years) seen in our pulmonary disease outpatient clinics. Patients with obstructive (n = 75), restrictive (n = 31), mixed (n = 26) or other respiratory diseases (n = 18) were initially assessed by history and physical examination and classified as improved, stable, or worse compared to previous visits. A clinical management plan (CMP) was formulated based on this initial evaluation. Spirometric results were then made available to the examiner who could then make changes in the proposed CMP. The addition of spirometric results caused alteration of the CMP in only eight (5 percent) patients; in the remaining 142 patients, results did not affect the CMP. Two clinical findings identified those patients whose CMP was most likely to be altered by spirometry: severity of lung dysfunction (determined from previous spirometry) and deterioration of clinical status (judged by history and physical examination). Of the eight patients whose CMP was changed after review of spirometry, six (75 percent) had previous severe ventilatory dysfunction (FEV1 or FVC less than or equal to 40 percent of predicted or FEV1/FVC ratio less than or equal to 0.40). In 6 of 38 patients (16 percent) with severe ventilatory dysfunction, CMP was altered after spirometry while only 2 of 112 patients (1.8 percent) with mild or moderate dysfunction had changes in their CMP. Patients who were clinically assessed as worse compared to their previous visit were more likely to have their CMP altered after review of spirometry when compared to those considered improved or stable by a ratio of 6:1. These results suggest that spirometry is most likely to supplement the physician's history and physical examination in the management of outpatients with pulmonary disease when the initial evaluation suggests that the patient has clinically deteriorated since the previous clinic visit, or when he or she has previous severe ventilatory dysfunction.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Screening for occupational asthma: a word of caution.The diagnosis of occupational asthma may be difficult due to the complex mechanisms inducing the disorder. Identification of the offending agent after historical documentation may be difficult without bronchial challenge. The hallmark of asthma is bronchial hyperreactivity as detected by methacholine challenge, and this test could be considered as a screening test for asthma in the workplace. Four cases are presented that document changes in methacholine airway reactivity dependent on temporal association with exposure to the workplace or the specific offending agent. This indicates a need for a careful evaluation of symptoms relative to exposure in patients suspected for workplace asthma as well as serial determinations of methacholine response to detect potential variability in the airway reactivity.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Allergic histories and reactions of patients treated with digoxin immune Fab (ovine) antibody. The Digibind Study Advisory Panel.Seven hundred seventeen adult patients with life-threatening digitalis intoxication were treated with Fab fragments of ovine antidigoxin immunoglobulin G (IgG). Results of the efficacy of treatment and adverse effects were collected with standard report forms. Eighty-two (11%) of the patients were recorded as having histories of allergy (71 patients) and/or asthma (11 patients). Of the \"allergic\" subjects, 35 described reactions to antibiotics, 19 to other medications, 3 to foods, and 2 to pollens; in 12 subjects the etiologic agent was not specified. Six subjects had adverse reactions that were probably or possibly due to allergy to components of the antibody preparation. Of these 4 (5%; 95% confidence interval (Cl) 1.8% to 12%) occurred in the 82 subjects with histories of allergy or asthma and 3 (9%; 95% Cl 1.8% to 23%) of these occurred in the 35 persons with histories of allergy to an antibiotic. In contrast, only 2 (0.3%; 95% Cl 0.04% to 1.1%) similar reactions occurred in the 635 subjects with no histories of allergy or asthma. All reactions responded to symptomatic treatment. The authors conclude that treatment of digitalis intoxication with ovine antidigoxin IgG-Fab (Digibind) is generally well tolerated and allergic reactions are rare. However, there is a significantly increased risk of reactions in patients with histories of allergy or asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Bronchial asthma.Asthma is one of the most common respiratory problems in modern industrialized countries, affecting over 5% of the population. It affects all age groups from infants to senior citizens, and mortality rates from asthma appear to be increasing during the past few years in the United States as well as in other industrialized countries. Asthma tends to occur in families, associated with other allergic disease, and may be induced by a wide variety of environmental antigens, most commonly inhaled allergens such as pollen and dust. Bronchial challenge with a specific allergen results in an early bronchospastic response with a relatively brief duration, and in a significant number of patients there is a late response with onset after 3 to 4 hours, lasting hours to days. This late response is associated with a bronchial hypersensitivity reaction, which is demonstrable by nonspecific challenge testing in the laboratory. During the period of bronchial hyperresponsiveness patients are prone to develop attacks following exposure to a wide variety of \"triggers,\" including cold air, fumes, or cigarette smoke. The current approach to management of patients with asthma emphasizes prevention, with avoidance of specific allergens when possible, and chronic use of anti-inflammatory agents including corticosteroids and cromolyn sodium. The goal is to decrease the bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Management of the acute asthma attack consists of bronchodilator therapy, primarily with inhaled beta-adrenergic agonists, and administration of oral or systemic corticosteroids if the attack is not rapidly relieved. Additional therapeutic agents including theophylline and anticholinergics may be useful in some situations. Response to therapy during the first couple of hours in the emergency room is the most important predictor of the course of the acute attack, and patients who have not responded significantly after 2 hours of maximum therapy are candidates for hospital admission or prolonged emergency room observation. The goal of acute therapy is to wean the patient from intravenous drugs and place him or her on rapidly tapering doses of oral prednisone while initiating a vigorous program of preventive therapy. Follow-up observation, both in the office and in the patient's home, is vital and involves extensive patient education and objective testing of peak airflow. In general, the course of asthma is relatively benign compared with other obstructive airway diseases; however, significant mortality exists, especially in older patients and those with late-onset asthma.\n",

In this case study, the target population consists of parents of asthmatic children (0-4 years of age). Six focus group interviews were conducted with the purpose of discussing parents' experiences with health care for asthma, their beliefs and knowledge of general aspects of asthma, medication and preventive actions. As a supplement, parents completed a written questionnaire providing additional quantitative information on parental knowledge and misconceptions. Results indicated that parental knowledge of asthma in general was not adequate, especially with respect to medication, preceding signs and preventive activities. Important misconceptions, which might contribute to noncompliance with self-management behaviors, were revealed during discussions with the parents. Several differences were found between results of the interviews and the questionnaire, for instance regarding parental knowledge about preventive measures, medication and perceived parental satisfaction with health care for asthma. These differences indicate the value of using both a survey and a focus group.\n",

Pre- and post-tests of 40 children age 6-12 years revealed that the children had statistically significant increases in knowledge of and expected response to early warning signs of acute asthma, and in their sense of personal control (Health Locus of Control). Parents reported an increased use of asthma self-management techniques for acute episodes of asthma.

Much of the discussion focuses on self-management skills, particularly the essential ingredients of data collection, information processing and evaluation, steps required to manage attacks and self-reaction to performance. A final section of the paper speculates on the future directions of applying behavioral techniques to childhood asthma. The need to analyze individual attacks suffered by individual patients is emphasized; in addition, the scientific skills required to successfully manage asthma, performed both by medical personnel and patients, are described. It is hoped that the future will see these skills applied in a manner so that each attack is treated as if it were an experiment.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Respiratory problems among cotton textile mill workers in Ethiopia.This study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of respiratory problems, in particular byssinosis, and to explore factors associated with their occurrence among a group of 595 randomly selected workers representing 40.5% of those exposed to dusty operations in a typical Ethiopian cotton textile mill. A standard questionnaire on respiration was administered and pre and postshift forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) were determined for each worker; workers found to have byssinosis and other respiratory diseases were compared with workers having no respiratory diseases in terms of the level and duration of exposure to cotton dust and other variables. Multiple area air samples from different sections were analysed for elutriated cotton dust concentrations (0.86-3.52 mg/m3). The prevalence of byssinosis was 43.2% among blowers and 37.5% in carders in comparison with four to 24% among workers in other sections. Prevalence of chronic bronchitis ranged from 17.6 to 47.7% and bronchial asthma from 8.5 to 20.5% across all sections. Significant across shift decrements in FEV1 and FVC were seen in those workers with respiratory tract diseases compared with those workers without such diseases. A significant dose response relation for pulmonary function and respiratory illnesses was also found by regression analysis. Preventive measures are proposed. Further research including a nationwide survey of textile mills is suggested. This is the first epidemiological study of the textile industry in Ethiopia.\n",

Theophylline plasma concentrations and pulmonary function tests were performed throughout the study. Cognitive functioning tests and self-report measures were administered at baseline and after each medication phase. Behavior ratings were obtained from parents and teachers. Parents' and teachers' ratings did not reflect a theophylline effect on attention or activity level; children's self-reports showed no changes in mood, and no statistically significant differences were found on measures of cognitive processing. Large individual differences in sensitivity to theophylline effects were present. Although most of the children tolerated theophylline well, those already having attentional or achievement problems appeared vulnerable to adverse effects.

The present report focuses on the symptoms of the 14,799 adults at least 21 yr of age. The overall response rate was 83%, and missing values for individual variables ranged from 3 to 8%. The presence of home dampness and/or molds (that is, damp spots, visible mold or mildew, water damage, and flooding) was reported by 38% of respondents. The prevalence of lower respiratory symptoms (any cough, phlegm, wheeze, or wheeze with dyspnea) was increased among those reporting dampness or mold compared with those not reporting dampness or mold as follows: 38 versus 27% among current smokers, 21 versus 14% among exsmokers, and 19 versus 11% among nonsmokers (all p values less than 0.001). This association persisted after adjusting for several sociodemographic variables (including age, sex, and region) and several other exposure variables (including active and passive cigarette smoke, natural gas heating, and wood stoves). The odds ratio between symptoms and dampness was 1.62 (95% confidence interval, 1.48 to 1.78) in the final model chosen. This association persisted despite stratification by the presence of allergies or asthma.

      "ABSTRACT Is the clinical history a satisfactory means of diagnosing occupational asthma?In some countries a diagnosis of occupational asthma for medicolegal purposes is made when a questionnaire is suggestive and the individual is exposed to a product known to be a sensitizer. The value of an open questionnaire administered by physicians with experience in occupational asthma is unknown, however. We prospectively assessed all subjects (162) referred to our clinic because their physicians thought their asthma might be work related. The medical questionnaire included questions about the nature of the symptoms (dyspnea, wheezing, cough, and chest tightness) and the timing (worse at work or after a shift at work or improved during weekends or holidays). An initial clinical assessment was set by the physician on a scale that ranged from highly probable to probable, uncertain, unlikely, or absent. Subjects then underwent objective assessment with specific inhalation challenges (n = 72), serial monitoring of peak expiratory flow rates for periods at work and away from work (n = 29), or both (n = 61), to confirm or rule out the diagnosis of occupational asthma. A total of 75 subjects (46%) were shown to have occupational asthma. Symptoms alone (type and timing) did not provide a satisfactory differentiation between those subjects with and those without occupational asthma. For example, 66 of 75 (88%) subjects with occupational asthma said that their symptoms improved during holidays, but 66 of 87 (76%) subjects without occupational asthma experienced a similar improvement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "ABSTRACT Dynamic T-cell changes in peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage after antigen bronchoprovocation in asthmatics.We previously demonstrated decrease of peripheral blood CD4+ cells 48 to 72 h after antigen-induced bronchoprovocation in asthmatic subjects. To determine if this was accompanied by reciprocal changes in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, we sampled BAL before and 48 h after antigen administration. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and BAL T-cell subset composition were examined in eight extrinsic asthmatics during three different weeks. During control week (CW) BAL was preformed at baseline, and PBL subsets were followed for 3 days. During placebo week (PW) a placebo inhalation was followed by a BAL at 48 h and daily PBL for 3 days. Asthmatic attacks were induced by inhalation of a relevant antigen at the start of antigen week (AW) and followed by examining the BAL at 48 h and PBL daily for 72 h. We found that BAL as a stimulus had no effect on T-cell composition of the PBL after the procedure. After induction of an asthmatic attack there was a reduction of PBL CD4+ cells from a baseline mean of 52.6% to 38.8% at 48 h (p less than 0.05). At the same time BAL CD4+ cells increased from 35.6% at PW to 47.3% in AW (p less than 0.05). These data are compatible with specific recruitment of PBL CD4+ cells into the respiratory system in atopic subjects undergoing antigenic bronchoprovocation.\n",

PBMC isolated from control groups (mild asthma, chronic obstructive airway disease, normal subjects) were cultured in a similar fashion. After incubation, the culture supernatants were tested for neutrophil chemotactic activity (NCA) using a modified Boyden chamber technique. PBMC from patients with acute severe asthma elaborated significantly greater amounts of NCA into the culture supernatants as compared with all three control groups (p less than 0.01). The amounts of PBMC-derived NCA from the same patients after 7 days of hospital therapy and clinical improvement were reduced (p less than 0.01). A correlation was observed between the extent of reduction in spontaneous release of NCA by PBMC derived from patients with acute severe asthma and the degree of clinical improvement of their asthma (p less than 0.02). Both monocytes and lymphocytes, when cultured separately, released NCA in amounts sufficient to account for the total activity released by unfractionated PBMC. NCA in PBMC culture supernatants accumulated progressively with time, a process inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by cycloheximide. The amounts of NCA in culture supernatants did not correlate with the concentrations of histamine in lysates of the PBMC prepared just prior to culture.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "ABSTRACT Inhaled furosemide prevents both the bronchoconstriction and the increase in neutrophil chemotactic activity induced by ultrasonic \"fog\" of distilled water in asthmatics.Inhaled furosemide has been shown to prevent bronchoconstriction induced by inhalation of ultrasonic nebulization of distilled water (UNDW) in bronchial asthma. To evaluate whether inhaled furosemide also prevents the increase in serum neutrophil chemotactic activity (NCA) observed during UNDW bronchoconstriction, we measured NCA during UNDW challenge without (control) and immediately after inhalation of furosemide (40 mg) or placebo (saline) in 10 asthmatics responsive to UNDW, in a randomized, double-blind study. NCA was assessed by measuring the maximal distance reached by neutrophils in a filter when challenged with the subject serum in a Boyden chamber (\"leading front\"). UNDW inhalation produced a significant increase in NCA in each subject. Gel filtration chromatography on S400 column indicated that the NCA released were 600 to 700 kD. Saline had no effect on bronchoconstriction nor on NCA increase induced by UNDW in nine patients. Furosemide did not change baseline FEV1, but it prevented bronchoconstriction and NCA increase in nine patients. In the whole group the maximal decrease in FEV1 after UNDW was -31.1%, SEM 4.7 after saline and -7.5%, SEM 5.2 after furosemide, p less than 0.001, the maximal increase in NCA after UNDW was +52.9%, SEM 9.2 after saline and +3.8%, SEM 3.1 after furosemide, p = 0.001. These results indicate that inhaled furosemide prevents both the bronchoconstriction and the NCA increase induced by UNDW inhalation in most asthmatic patients. This finding adds support to the suggestion that furosemide acts on mast cells.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Holidays and atopic eczema.Information was collected by telephone about 300 holidays taken over a three year period by 126 children with severe atopic eczema. During the holidays, improvement in eczema occurred more frequently (112/300, 37%) than deterioration (63/300, 21%). There was a significant correlation between improvement and a more southerly holiday location: improvement was common in holidays taken in the Mediterranean or further south (63/92, 69%), but holidays in northern Britain were more likely to be associated with deterioration (27/100, 27%) than improvement (13/100, 13%). Changes in eczema were correlated with changes in asthma in 231 holidays taken by children with both conditions, but improvement was not significantly associated with pet ownership. All patients returned to their preholiday state, usually within two weeks of return home. The causes of changes in eczema while on holiday have not been identified.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Hydration in severe acute asthma.Twenty children were studied during severe attacks of acute asthma to find out how dehydrated they were on admission to hospital. Mean body weight on admission was 97.8% of their reference stable weight seven to 10 days after the attack and in only three children was it less than 95% of the stable weight. Bedside assessment of dehydration was unreliable. The mean packed cell volume was significantly higher on admission than 7-10 days later (0.44 compared with 0.42, difference 0.02 SE 0.01). Serum sodium and potassium concentrations and osmolality on admission were within normal ranges. The degree of dehydration correlated best with a fall in blood pH. There was no association between the degree of dehydration and the recovery of the peak expiratory flow rate during the first 24 hours or thereafter. We conclude that mild dehydration is common in severe acute childhood asthma. Fluid given at a rate of 50 ml/kg/24 hours was safe and appropriate for these children.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Experience with in vitro rapid diagnostic methods (DHS-CLA) in childhood bronchial asthma].The authors examined the value of the chemoluminescent assay (CLA) in 35 asthmatic children. Each serum sample was examined concerning its reaction with 35 allergen extracts and the appropriate IgE value was also determined. The allergen-panel was adapted to the Hungarian prevalence. Results were read within 24 hours. Skin prick test and in vitro CLA results were in agreement in 89% of measurement. Purified, major antigens (grass, mite) gave a specially good concordance. Good agreement was also found in highly sensitized patients and children in the age below 3 years; in such cases RAST and CLA values were compared. In discordant cases revision of anamnesis supported the positive CLA result, however in some (5) negative CLA test this could not be strengthened. Chemoluminescent assay was shown to be fast, reliable and risk-free method, but high costs still limit its general use.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Analysis of expiratory pattern for monitoring bronchial obstruction in school-age children.This study was designed to assess the validity of the percent of volume expired at tidal peak flow (dV/Vt) as an indicator of bronchial obstruction in school-age children. We analyzed 126 dV/Vt ratios and compared them with spirometric and plethysmographic results measured in 24 healthy (14 males) and 60 asthmatic (41 males) children; 42 of them underwent measurements before and after bronchial challenge with histamine. The two groups differed in resistance, forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1), and forced expiratory flows, as percents of predicted (FEV1: 94.6 +/- 2.4% in controls vs 86.7 +/- 1.6% in asthmatics; P less than 0.001). They did not differ in peak expiratory flow (PEF), forced vital capacity, functional residual capacity, measured by body plethysmography, and in dV/Vt. The dV/Vt was found to correlate with FEV1 (r = 0.58, P less than 0.001), PEF (r = 0.57, P less than 0.001), and other lung function parameters. Forty-two of the asthmatic children performed a bronchoprovocation histamine test. The fall of dV/Vt after histamine was significantly correlated (r = 0.61, P less than 0.001) with the variation in FEV1 and other lung function parameters. We conclude that dV/Vt is a good indicator of bronchial obstruction, as useful in school-age children as in adults and infants, with no need for the subject's cooperation.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The sensation of pulmonary dyspnea in school-age children.The purpose of this investigation was to describe the sensation of dyspnea in a sample of 39 school-age children with asthma and to identify strategies used to cope with the symptom. In addition, three methods to measure dyspnea intensity in children were tested and compared. Breathing on a \"bad breathing day\" was used as a proxy variable to represent dyspnea. The most frequent description of how breathing feels on a bad day was \"it is hard to breathe.\" Words chosen most frequently from a checklist of sensations were \"wheezy,\" \"short of breath,\" \"tight,\" and physical sensations such as \"throwing up,\" \"hurting,\" and \"stuffiness.\" The children's feelings on a bad breathing day were categorized as negative moods or emotions, a wish for change, or physical symptoms. Ratings of breathing on \"good\", \"bad,\" and \"usual breathing\" days on word descriptor, visual analogue, and color scales provided evidence of concurrent validity for the three measures of dyspnea intensity. The most frequent strategies used to cope with dyspnea were medications, change in position, decreased activity, fluids, relaxation, distraction, and social support. The findings were very similar to those previously described for an adult sample.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Neural control of airway vasculature and edema.The tracheobronchial vasculature is controlled by adrenergic, cholinergic, and peptidergic nervous mechanisms. Sympathetic nerves release norepinephrine and neuropeptide Y (NPY), which are both constrictor agents, the latter being long-lasting. Parasympathetic nerves release acetylcholine and usually vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), both of which are vasodilators, VIP being the longer lasting. These motor nerves are controlled by many reflex inputs. Activation of pulmonary C-fiber receptors by irritants and inflammatory mediators causes a powerful vasodilatation, mainly via sympathetic motor nerves. Cardiac and chemoreceptor reflexes also influence airway vascular tone. Sensory nerves in the airway mucosa are responsible for local axon reflexes in response to irritants and inflammatory mediators. These nerves contain neuropeptides such as substance P (SP), neurokinins A and B (NKA, NKB), and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). All these neuropeptides are powerful vasodilators. Thus, inflammatory conditions in the lungs such as asthma cause vasodilation by local direct action of mediators, by axon reflexes, and by central nervous reflexes. The vasodilation could lead to mucosal edema. Thus, airway vascular responses have to be added to bronchoconstriction and mucus secretion as part of the mucosal pathology of asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Modulation of neurogenic inflammation by neutral endopeptidase.The enzyme neutral endopeptidase (NEP) is bound to the membranes of selected cells in the airways that have receptors for tachykinins. The location of the enzyme, along with its selectivity of substrates (tachykinins are a preferred substrate), allows the enzyme to cleave tachykinins that come close to the cell-surface receptors. By cleaving and thus inactivating tachykinins released during stimulation of the sensory nerves, NEP limits the degree of neurogenic inflammation. Neutral endopeptidase exists in the basal cells of the airway epithelium, nerves, smooth muscle, glands, blood vessels, and perhaps other cells. Thus, the enzyme modulates smooth muscle contraction, gland secretion, cough, vascular permeability, and neutrophil adhesion. Decreased NEP activity occurs with epithelial removal, during respiratory viral infections, and during exposure to irritants (e.g., cigarette smoke and toluene diisocyanate). Delivery of recombinant NEP (rNEP) by aerosol suppressed cough responses during neurogenic inflammation. We suggest that decreased NEP activity will result in exaggerated neurogenic inflammation and may play an important role in inflammatory diseases in airways. Furthermore, drugs that cause up-regulation of NEP may play a therapeutic role by suppressing neurogenic responses. Replacement therapy with rNEP may be useful in diseases where inflammatory peptides (e.g., tachykinins, bradykinin) play a role in pathogenesis.\n",

      "ABSTRACT PAF antagonism as an approach to the treatment of airway hyperreactivity.Platelet-activating factor (PAF) would seem a good candidate for a mediator of airway hyperreactivity. It has been reported to induce a long-lasting, if modest, increase in hyperreactivity in both experimental animals and humans. Evidence (albeit often indirect) suggests increased levels associated with bronchial hyperreactivity or the related \"late-phase reaction\" of asthma. In experimental animals, specific inhibitors of PAF can suppress both allergen and PAF-induced hyperreactivity as well as the late-phase reaction to allergen. The mechanism by which PAF induces hyperreactivity is unknown, but the potent effects of PAF on the eosinophil, a cell characteristic of the inflammatory processes often associated with asthma and hyperreactivity, may be important. A number of potent and selective PAF antagonists are now available. The crucial test for the hypothesis that PAF has a role in human airway hyperreactivity will be the testing of substances such as these in appropriate double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.\n",

Once a patient has developed restrictions, prompt institution of rehabilitation is essential to prevent significant disability, which can be avoided or even reversed.

      "ABSTRACT Eosinophil cationic protein stimulates and major basic protein inhibits airway mucus secretion.Possible roles of eosinophil (EO) products in modulating the release of mucus from airway explants were investigated. Cell- and membrane-free lysates from purified human EOs (1 to 20 x 10(5)) caused a dose-dependent release of respiratory glycoconjugates (RGC) from cultured feline tracheal explants. Crude extracts from isolated EO granules also stimulated RGC release, suggesting that a granular protein might be responsible. Three proteins derived from EO granules, EO-derived neurotoxin, EO cationic protein (ECP), and major basic protein (MBP) were separated by sequential sizing and affinity chromatography. ECP (0.025 to 25 micrograms/ml) caused a dose-dependent increase in RGC release from both feline and human airway explants and also stimulated the release of the serous cell-marker, lactoferrin, from human bronchial explants. EO-derived neurotoxin (0.025 to 50 micrograms/ml) failed to affect RGC release, whereas MBP (50 micrograms/ml) significantly inhibited RGC release from feline explants. Thus, ECP stimulates RGC and lactoferrin release from airway explants, whereas MBP inhibits RGC release.\n",

Dapsone was chosen because it inhibits neutrophil function and possesses anti-inflammatory effects in a variety of disorders. The study group consisted of 10 subjects with stable, steroid-dependent asthma, aged 23 to 80 years, with normal glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase levels. Average daily baseline prednisone dose ranged from 5 to 60 mg. Dapsone, 100 mg, twice daily, by mouth, was started after a 1-month baseline period. Baseline steroid dose, symptom scores, and daily peak flow rates were compared to the latest available 4-week period of dapsone treatment. Average cumulative monthly prednisone dose was reduced from 428 mg to 82 mg (p less than 0.02). Five of 10 patients stopped steroids by month 6 and two additional patients by month 13. Two additional patients demonstrated a coincidental 74% reduction in steroid dose, and one patient demonstrated no response. Clinical parameters remained stable despite steroid reduction. These preliminary data suggest dapsone may have steroid-sparing effects in chronic asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Local immunotherapy with Dermatophagoides extract in asthma.Local immunotherapy (LIT) with Dermatophagoides extract or placebo were administered to two groups of 11 patients with allergic asthma in a double-blind fashion. All patients received cromolyn sodium (20 mg four times a day) during treatments. Bronchial provocation tests with allergen and methacholine were performed before, 1 week, and 4 weeks after the end of treatments. Symptom score, drug consumption, and peak expiratory flow were monitored daily from 2 weeks before to 4 weeks after treatments. Compared to baseline, early bronchial sensitivity to allergen was significantly reduced both 1 week (p less than 0.0005) and 4 weeks (p less than 0.01) after LIT but not after placebo administration. Late bronchial reaction to allergen occurred similarly after placebo administration and LIT. However, in the group with LIT, the severity of late reaction was unchanged after treatment in spite of the significantly larger doses of allergen administered to provoke the early asthmatic reaction. Neither symptom score, nor drug consumption, nor peak expiratory flow were significantly different in the two groups before and during the treatment period even though both symptom score and drug consumption tended to be reduced after LIT. We conclude that LIT may be an effective and safe alternative to traditional immunotherapy.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Methacholine challenges in the management of young children.Methacholine bronchial challenges (MBCs) have been used as an important diagnostic and management tool for physicians who treat children with chronic asthma. Despite this, children less than 5 years of age present significant diagnostic and management questions that can not easily be answered because of their inability to perform standard spirometry, and thus methacholine bronchial challenges. The present study was designed to evaluate with methacholine bronchial challenge small children (between 2 and 6 years of age) with the diagnosis of or a suspected diagnosis of asthma, utilizing a new method of evaluating airflow in small children through sound analysis, Computer Digitized Airway Phonopneumography (CDAP). There were 23 children in the study between the ages of 2 and 6 years with suspected asthma who could not perform pulmonary function tests. A control group consisting of 12 subjects between the ages of 8 and 38 years of age with a history of chronic cough and/or wheezing who could perform pulmonary function tests was also studied. Of the 12 patients over the age of 8 who had MBC, 11 of them had positive challenges with a fall in FEV1 of 19% or greater. The percent change in sound intensity levels from baseline range from 232% to 396% of baseline. There was greater than 200% change in mean intensity levels with a concentration of methacholine that produced a 19% fall in FEV1 in all of the eleven patients. For one individual who had a negative MBC there was only a 16% change in pulmonary function at 25 mg of methacholine with essentially no change in sound intensity level from baseline.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "ABSTRACT Chronotherapy of reversible airways disease with once-daily evening doses of a controlled-release theophylline preparation.1. Asthma and COPD worsen at night and in the early morning, due to various circadian influences. 2. Uninterrupted sleep, stable lung function over 24 h, and reduced and stable airways responsiveness are primary therapeutic goals in asthma and COPD. 3. Once-daily evening theophylline chronotherapy meets these goals, providing rising blood levels at night and in the early morning, when most needed. 4. This regimen is now indicated for morning and evening dosing for reversible airway obstruction, in the United States and Canada, and marks the first available treatment for these diseases to include dosing time in the therapeutic strategy. It reflects increasing recognition by the medical community of the need to consider the individual patient's timing of symptoms in relation to the kinetics of the drug. 5. Theophylline chronotherapy is as well tolerated as more frequently administered methylxanthine preparations despite the relatively large single doses required by the prolonged dosing interval. The convenience of once-daily administration favors drug-taking compliance. 6. Theophylline chronotherapy does not provide constant blood levels over the 24-h day. Indeed, by improving lung function by means of a larger peak-to-trough difference than associated with twice-daily theophylline, once-daily chronotherapy has altered our thinking about theophylline pharmacodynamics.\n",

During episodes of wheezing, lung function tests were consistent with variable extrathoracic obstruction. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy confirmed that wheezing was due to paradoxical adduction of the vocal cords during the respiratory cycle. Clinical symptoms improved with speech therapy and psychological aid in relaxation. Vocal cord dysfunction is important in the differential diagnosis of bronchial asthma.\n",

Eleven completed the trial, four dropped out on account of severe acute asthma and one with muscle tremor. Overall there was a small significant drop of mean prebronchodilator FEV1 after one month of 0.27 L (95% confidence interval 0.12, 0.42) but not significant thereafter. The increase of bronchial responsiveness (mean decrease of PD20 of 0.50 doubling doses of methacholine) by the end of month four did not reach statistical significance. Our study which explored potentially adverse effects of this beta agonist regimen showed only small changes of doubtful clinical significance.

      "ABSTRACT Multidisciplinary co-operation in primary care for asthmatic children.In the development of 'education protocols' for the treatment and education about chronic diseases in primary care the involvement of several disciplines of careproviders must often be taken into account. This implies that tasks will have to be divided across several disciplines. An orderly way to do this does not seem to have been suggested in the literature. In this paper a systematic technique is presented to divide educational tasks across disciplines. The basic idea of this method is that one should link up as far as possible with existing task conceptions and knowledge of the disciplines involved. The general description of the technique will be followed by a piece of research in which the technique is applied to protocol development for parents of asthmatic children (0-4 years). The protocol aims at allocating specific asthma education tasks to community nurses, general practitioners, asthma nurses and doctors working at child health centers in the Netherlands. This paper focuses mainly on results for community nurses. Three criteria were considered in assigning tasks to the different careproviders: whether the discipline in question claimed a certain task; whether the other three disciplines agreed with the claim, and whether the discipline in question had appropriate and sufficient knowledge about asthma to perform the task correctly. Community nurses did claim several tasks in asthma care, but knowledge did not always seem to be sufficient. Additional results indicated that nurses who had taken a refresher course did have a higher knowledge level than nurses who had not taken such a course. Regular contact with asthmatic children also tended to be associated with increased knowledge of asthma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

Only the results from less rigorously designed trials have failed to show a beneficial effect. The onset of response, dose, and mode of administration have been relatively well defined; however, other aspects (i.e., duration of therapy, need to taper the dose, and risks of multiple short bursts) require further study. Early institution of corticosteroids in well-defined patient populations will decrease the need for hospitalizations. However, administration of corticosteroids to every patient presenting to the clinician's office or emergency room prior to aggressive bronchodilator therapy is unwarranted. All patients demonstrating an incomplete response or the inability to maintain a complete response following one to two hours of aggressive bronchodilator therapy should receive a course of corticosteroids. Courses as short as three to five days have proven efficacy in outpatients, whereas hospitalized patients usually are treated for seven to ten days. The duration of therapy depends on the individual rate of response.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Lung function and bronchial reactivity in asthmatics during exposure to volatile organic compounds.The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether vapors of organic solvents at low concentrations could exert an adverse effect in the lower airways. Under controlled conditions in a climate chamber, 11 persons with bronchial hyperreactivity to histamine and bronchial asthma were exposed for 90 min to a mixture of organic solvents at levels of zero, 2.5, and 25 mg/m3. During exposure to 25 mg/m3 a decrease in FEV1 to 90.7% of baseline value was measured. This was significantly different from the initial value (p less than 0.05), but not significantly different from the value found after sham exposure (FEV1, 97.4% of initial value). The decline in FEV1 during exposure to 25 mg/m3 was most pronounced in persons with high bronchial sensitivity. No changes were found in histamine reactivity after exposure, and no late reactions were registered. Ratings of discomfort showed different individual patterns ranging from no response to reactions towards both of the concentrations. The ratings indicated development of tolerance during exposure. Volatile organic compounds in concentrations found in both the work and the home environments may influence lung function and are probably of importance as bronchial irritants.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The safety aspects of fiberoptic bronchoscopy, bronchoalveolar lavage, and endobronchial biopsy in asthma.We have documented the physiologic effects of fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and endobronchial biopsy performed under local anesthesia in 20 asthmatic subjects, 8 healthy nonatopic control subjects, and 8 atopic nonasthmatic subjects. Premedication consisted of nebulized albuterol (2.5 mg; except for the study of atopic nonasthmatic subjects), ipratropium bromide (500 micrograms), and intramuscular atropine (0.6 mg). Intravenous midazolam was given for mild sedation, and oxygen was delivered via a nasal cannula. FEV1 was measured before and after premedication, immediately postbronchoscopy, and after 2 h recovery. There was a significant fall in mean (+/- SD) FEV1 immediately postbronchoscopy in both the asthmatic (26.2 +/- 16.7%; p less than 0.001) and normal (9 +/- 4.7%, p less than 0.05) groups, which in the asthmatic subjects correlated inversely with the concentration of methacholine provoking a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20) measured 5 days prebronchoscopy (r = -0.74, p less than 0.001) but not with symptom scores, albuterol use, or peak expiratory flow (PEF) variation recorded during 2 wk before the investigation. There was significant arterial hemoglobin O2 desaturation during biopsy in the asthmatic subjects (median 3%, range -1 to 17% fall from baseline; p less than 0.01), which was not related to any of the measured indices of asthma severity. PC20, measured 5 days before and 5 days after bronchoscopy in the asthmatic subjects and 2 days before and 1 day after bronchoscopy in the atopic nonasthmatic subjects was not significantly affected by the procedure. We conclude that fiberoptic bronchoscopy with BAL and endobronchial biopsy can be conducted safely in asthmatic subjects, but requires caution in those with very responsive airways.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "ABSTRACT Effects of PAF antagonist, BN52021, on the PAF-, methacholine-, and allergen-induced bronchoconstriction in asthmatic children.Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is an inflammatory mediator capable of inducing protracted inflammation of the airways and bronchial hyperreactivity. Twenty-one asthmatic children were evenly divided into three groups and each group performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled and crossover study on the effect of aerosolized BN52021, a PAF antagonist, on the bronchoconstriction induced by PAF, methacholine, or specific allergen, respectively. One group of healthy children was included for comparison. Total WBC, neutrophils, and eosinophils were counted before and after PAF challenge. The results showed the following: (1) six of seven asthmatics and one of seven normal subjects gave a positive bronchial provocation with PAF; (2) in asthmatics, prior inhalation of BN52021 could inhibit the bronchoconstriction induced by PAF (6/6) and allergen (3/7), but not by methacholine; and (3) 5 min after inhalation of PAF, there was a marked decrease of peripheral blood eosinophils and neutrophils that could be inhibited by prior inhalation of BN52021 in normal subjects but not in asthmatics. These findings support the idea that PAF may be involved in the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma and PAF antagonist may have a role in the prevention and treatment of this disease.\n",

Several points of this case are uncommon: the long latency period (40 years), simultaneous aggravation of asthma requiring increasing doses of corticosteroids, and above all, liver and biliary tract involvement. Disseminated strongyloidiasis is widely believed to be precipitated by impairment of cell-mediated immunity. It is therefore unlikely that infestation of the liver and the biliary tract can interfere with hepatic function.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Theophylline in asthma and COPD: changing perspectives and controversies.Theophylline's role in the treatment of airway obstruction has been challenged, yet it remains a useful agent in the management of obstructive lung disease. It has a narrow therapeutic range and frequent side effects. Drug interactions are common, and variations in theophylline clearance among patients arise from individual differences in its absorption, metabolism, and elimination. Acute bronchospasm is best treated with inhaled sympathomimetic agents, but the nonbronchodilator effects of theophylline offer therapeutic benefits for the patient with non-reversible disease. When properly monitored by serum level determinations, theophylline may be used as an adjunct to aerosol therapy and corticosteroids in asthma. However, the patient with COPD may benefit the most from an empiric trial of the drug, using lower doses than were commonly employed in the past.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Treatment of status asthmaticus with intravenous magnesium sulfate.The bronchodilating effect of magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) was studied in two patients with status asthmaticus, who were intubated and mechanically ventilated by a respirator. Airway resistance was continuously monitored by the respiration-controlled interruption technique. After administration of 0.5 mmol/min MgSO4 intravenously, airway resistance decreased from 17 to 9, and from 13 to 8 mmHg/L/s in the two patients, respectively, and piping rales diminished or disappeared.

      "ABSTRACT A bronchial response comparison of exercise and methacholine in asthmatic subjects.The authors compared the inhaled methacholine and exercise responses in 22 stable unmedicated asthmatic patients. The exercise and methacholine challenges were performed at one to three week intervals. Bronchial responsiveness to methacholine was measured in relation to the concentration of methacholine (PC20M). The response to exercise was expressed as the percentage of fall in FEV1 from the pre-exercise FEV1. The findings showed that 21 of 22 subjects demonstrated a fall in FEV1 of more than 20% after methacholine challenge, while only 9/22 subjects experienced a similar decrease in FEV1. All 9 of these positive response exercise cases completed three consecutive exercise challenges prior to the methacholine challenge. Of these cases, five were refractory to the repeated exercise challenge, and the PD20M at the nonexercise stage was significantly lower than the postexercise state. In fact, the methacholine challenge sensitivity actually decreased (PD20 increased) after repeated exercise. The authors concluded that methacholine seems to be a more sensitive bronchial provocation test than exercise. Second, only 55.6% of the exercise test-positive subjects were refractory to the second exercise challenge. Therefore, other factors besides the release of mediators should be considered in exercise-induced asthma. Third, methacholine sensitivity actually decreased (PD20 increases) after repeat exercise challenge.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Human eosinophil major basic protein induces airway constriction and airway hyperresponsiveness in primates.We have examined the effects of direct intratracheal instillation of purified eosinophil granule proteins on pulmonary function and airway responsiveness in primates. The results of this study show for the first time that installation of major basic protein (MBP) directly into the trachea of primates results in a significant and dose-related increase in airway responsiveness to inhaled methacholine. Furthermore, MBP and eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) induce a transient bronchoconstriction immediately after instillation that resolves by 1 h postinstillation. In contrast, instillation of other eosinophil granule proteins had no effect on airway responsiveness or pulmonary function. These data indicate a direct role of the eosinophil in the pathogenesis of airway hyperresponsiveness. We suggest that the MBP of human eosinophils has an effector role in the pathogenesis of airway hyperresponsiveness which may involve active interaction with resident airway tissue cells. MBP may also mediate altered lung function in various inflammatory lung diseases associated with pulmonary eosinophilia.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Analysis of factors associated with bronchial hyperreactivity to methacholine in bronchiectasis.Nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR) has been reported to occur in patients with bronchiectasis. To evaluate this further, we studied 77 patients with stable bronchiectasis (noncystic fibrosis) with special reference to the prevalence of BHR to methacholine (MCh), and its relation to lung function, sputum characteristics, concommitant asthma, and atopy. The concentration of MCh required to produce a fall of 20% in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), PC20, was determined by Wright's nebulization tidal breathing method. BHR defined by a PC20 greater than or equal to 8 mg/ml was found in 21 of 47 (45%) subjects who underwent bronchial challenge. Presence of BHR was positively associated with low baseline spirometric values, diagnosis of asthma, long duration of disease, and elevated total IgE on univariant analysis, and was significantly related to FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio and asthma on multiple regression analysis. Ten of the 21 hyperreactive subjects did not have clinical asthma, whereas all 11 of 22 subjects with clinical asthma who underwent bronchial challenge were hyperreactive. Among those with BHR, there was a positive correlation between PC20 and baseline FEV1. When patients were further classified into asthmatic and nonasthmatic subjects, a positive correlation between PC20 and FEV1 was seen only in those without asthma. Frequency of infective episodes and inflammatory score of sputum assessed by average daily volume, purulence, and leukocyte count did not differ significantly in the groups with and without BHR. These results suggest that BHR in patients with bronchiectasis is associated with coexistent asthma and worse spriometric values, and not with the severity of bronchial sepsis.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Clinical-physiologic correlations in acute asthma of childhood.Seventy-one patients who presented to the emergency room with acute asthma were evaluated to determine the relationship between common clinical signs and spirometric and transcutaneous arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) measurements. Prior to treatment, a physical examination was performed, a clinical score assigned, and pulmonary function and SaO2 were measured. Although forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and SaO2 had strong correlation with the overall clinical score (r2 = .47, .49 respectively), many patients with low clinical scores and apparent mild clinical disease had low FEV1 values (as low as 20% predicted). Of the individual components of the clinical score (ie, heart rate, respiratory rate, pulsus paradoxus, accessory muscle use, dyspnea, and wheezing), the degree of accessory muscle use correlated most closely with lung function followed by the degree of dyspnea and wheezing. Similarly, the degree of accessory muscle use correlated most closely with SaO2 followed by dyspnea and respiratory rate. Significant correlation (r2 = .59) was found between SaO2 and FEV1, although the range of SaO2 value for a given FEV1 was wide and some patients with low FEV1 values had normal SaO2 values. These results show that although clinically apparent severe disease and hypoxemia were always associated with low FEV1, their absence does not exclude the presence of airflow obstruction. It is concluded that for the optimal evaluation of acute asthma in children in the emergency room, clinical evaluation should be used in conjunction with objective laboratory measurements.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Long-term effects of biofeedback-induced facial relaxation on measures of asthma severity in children.We studied the effects of electromyographic biofeedback on measures of asthma severity in children. Fifteen children received biofeedback training to reduce facial tension, and 14 children, who served as controls, received biofeedback training to maintain facial tension at a stable level. Assignment to experimental condition was random. As a result of training, electromyographic levels decreased in children trained in facial relaxation and remained fairly constant in children trained in facial tension stability. Biofeedback training was augmented for children in both groups by having them practice their facial exercises at home. Each child's condition was followed for a five-month period subsequent to biofeedback training. Throughout the experiment, the following measures of asthma severity were monitored: lung function, self-rated asthma severity, medication usage, and frequency of asthma attacks. In addition, standardized measures of attitudes toward asthma, self-concept, and chronic anxiety were recorded at regular intervals. As compared to the facial stability subjects, the facial relaxation subjects exhibited higher pulmonary scores, more positive attitudes toward asthma, and lower chronic anxiety during the follow-up period. Subjects in the two groups, however, did not differ on self-rated asthma severity, medication usage, frequency of asthma attacks, or self-concept. Based on the improvements we observed in pulmonary, attitude, and anxiety measures, we concluded that biofeedback training for facial relaxation contributes to the self-control of asthma and would be a valuable addition to asthma self-management programs.\n",

Factor analysis demonstrated sensible clustering of responses to items unique to the new questionnaire such as nocturnal, spontaneous, and postexertional dyspnea, dust-induced dyspnea and tightness, and breathing difficulty. Responses to IUAT questions concerning past asthma, wheeze, chest tightness, morning cough and sputum, and asthma medication agreed well with corresponding items from the MRC questionnaire. Questions concerning asthma, medication, dust-induced, nocturnal, and spontaneous dyspnea, chest tightness, wheeze, nocturnal cough, postexertional dyspnea and breathing difficulty also had high validity against the criterion of concurrently measured bronchial reactivity.

Although pulmonary function tests were normal, laryngoscopy under general anesthesia revealed extremely severe vocal cord spasm induced by minimal contact of the laryngoscope. It required intravenous lidocaine and muscle relaxant to reverse. Spasm was not demonstrable one week later on repeat laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy. No structural abnormalities were seen. There was considerable family stress exacerbated by anxiety about the patient's illness. Parents were told that the condition was different from asthma and probably functional in origin. There have been no further episodes, possibly due to counseling and education in relaxation techniques as well as oral pharmacotherapy for asthma with avoidance of inhaled medications.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Parental perceptions of childhood illness.This article takes parental perception as the starting point of an analysis of the relationship between ill children, their families, and their doctors in the handling of a child's illness. A modified version of Creer, Marion, and Creer's Asthma Problem Behavior Checklist, adapted to suit Italian conditions, was used. The questionnaire was given to a sample of 460 parents of 230 preadolescent children. The sample was divided into two groups: The first sample was comprised of 84 parents of 42 preadolescent children with atopic symptoms (asthma, bronchitis, or hay fever), and the second sample was comprised of 376 parents of 188 preadolescents who had never had either atopic disturbances or any other serious disease. The results showed that both groups of parents felt their children were capable of autonomously managing their disease, and that they see medical facilities as their primary resource. Children were not perceived as being altered by their illness, although their illness undoubtedly affected family relationships; this was particularly true in the case of families with members who experience atopic problems. The factors causing the greatest difficulties were: disagreements over treatment, anxiety caused by the disease, and the sacrifices made by family members as a result of illness.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Effect of salbutamol on gastroesophageal reflux in healthy volunteers and patients with asthma.The aim of this work was to establish whether beta-adrenergic agonists promote or increase gastroesophageal reflux in patients with asthma. Ten healthy individuals and eight patients with asthma were studied on 2 different days. One day they received a placebo, and the other day they received 4 mg of salbutamol by mouth. Complete measurements of esophageal manometry were performed before and every 30 minutes for 210 minutes after the administration of the drugs. Esophageal pH was measured continuously for the duration of the experiment. The results demonstrate that (1) salbutamol had no effect on the lower esophageal sphincter pressure gradient, the peak esophageal contraction pressure, or the number and duration of reflux episodes in patients with asthma and normal individuals, and (2) patients with asthma have a resting lower esophageal sphincter pressure higher than healthy subjects. We conclude that the administration of salbutamol does not affect esophageal function.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Source of the aeroallergen of soybean dust: a low molecular mass glycopeptide from the soybean tela.Airborne soybean allergens in the dust generated during the unloading of soybeans in the harbor caused asthma epidemics in Barcelona, Spain. The major allergen causing the epidemics was a glycopeptide less than 14 kd molecular mass abundant in soybean dust. This allergen occurs in all parts of the soybean plant at all stages of growth, but the telae (hulls) and pods are by far the richest source. Small amounts of a similar cross-reacting allergen are found in some other grain dusts. The botanical function and significance of this soybean plant component is not known nor is the potential for airborne dispersion of this allergen at other grain-handling sites.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Cellular and biochemical characteristics of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in symptomatic nonallergic asthma.We have undertaken cellular and biochemical examination of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from nonallergic patients with asthma to determine the nature and degree of inflammatory process in symptomatic asthma. Six patients with asthma (mean methacholine provocative concentration causing a 20% fall in FEV1 was 0.26 mg/ml) and six control subjects underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar wash. The patients with asthma shed a higher number of epithelial cells into lavage fluid than normal control subjects (p less than 0.05). Their lavage fluid also contained increased numbers of neutrophils (p less than 0.025), eosinophils (p less than 0.025), and basophilic cells (p less than 0.025), and increased proportion of activated T cells (p less than 0.05). The basophilic cells were mast cells, as indicated by positive labeling with the monoclonal antibody MCG35. Biochemical analysis of lavage fluid demonstrated exudation of protein molecules in airways of patients with asthma with increased contents of albumin (p less than 0.05) and fibronectin (p less than 0.05). In the lavage fluid of patients with asthma, there were also increased amounts of interleukin-1-beta (IL-1-beta) (p less than 0.025), interleukin-6 (IL-6) (p less than 0.025), and granulocyte-macrophage, colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (p less than 0.05), as compared with lavage fluid of normal control subjects. Immunocytochemical evaluation of lavage cells demonstrated that IL-1-beta, IL-6, and GM-CSF were mostly produced by nonciliated epithelial cells and/or monocytes. IL-1, IL-6, and GM-CSF can prime granulocytes to respond to other stimuli and can promote T cell activation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "ABSTRACT Differences in mediator release between allergic rhinitis and asthma.To determine why patients with allergic rhinitis alone differ in their airway response to inhaled allergen compared to patients with allergic asthma, bronchial lavage was performed in 10 subjects with allergic asthma and in five subjects with allergic rhinitis, before and after inhalation challenge with antigen to produce an immediate asthmatic reaction. Before antigen challenge, the subjects with asthma had higher absolute neutrophil counts in the lavage fluid. After antigen challenge, the subjects with asthma released significant amounts of bronchoconstrictive mediators, such as histamine and thromboxane B2 into the lavage fluid, whereas subjects with rhinitis alone did not. There was also a significant increase in prostaglandin E2 in the subjects with asthma after antigen challenge. Nonimmunologic bronchoconstriction with methacholine inhalation challenge in six other subjects with asthma did not demonstrate an increase in any of the lavage fluid mediator levels that were measured. A positive correlation was found between methacholine provocative concentration causing a 20% drop in FEV1 and the concentration of prostaglandin E2 in the lavage fluid before challenge. The significance of this observation has yet to be determined. The results suggest that subjects with allergic asthma differ from subjects with rhinitis alone in their capacity to release more mediators into the airways on antigen challenge. It is not known whether this increase in mediators is due to increase in the number of mast cells in the airways or due to increase in mediator releasability from the mast cells of subjects with asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Theophylline analysis at the chest clinic--comparison of a portable versus conventional system.The running cost and clinical application of a new, portable, direct-injection, high-performance, liquid chromatograph for the measurement of theophylline was compared with conventional laboratory-based analysis by studying the two methods in two parallel chest clinics. Thirty-six patients were managed with the portable method and 33 by the conventional system. They were already receiving theophylline preparations for treatment of their asthma or chronic airflow limitation. Over the 12-week period of study, the percentage of patients with levels in the therapeutic range rose from 33% to approximately 87% in both clinics, but this change was achieved in only 6 weeks using the portable system. Patients whose theophylline levels were increased into the therapeutic range had improved symptom scores as measured by visual analogue scales but we were unable to demonstrate any significant change in spirometry. The cost of the portable system compared favourably with laboratory analysis, and had the additional benefit of quicker detection of non-compliance and facility for discussion with the patients at the time of consultation.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Prescribed fenoterol and death from asthma in New Zealand, 1981-7: a further case-control study.The association between inhaled fenoterol and death from asthma has been investigated further by studying 112 asthma deaths (cases) during 1981-7 in patients aged 5-45 years who had been admitted to a major hospital for asthma during the 12 months before death. Two age matched control groups were chosen. Control group A comprised 427 patients who had been admitted to hospital for asthma during the calendar year that the corresponding death occurred and who had also had a previous admission for asthma in the previous 12 months. Control group B comprised 448 patients admitted to hospital for asthma during the calendar year in which the admission of the corresponding case occurred. The inhaled fenoterol odds ratio was 2.11 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.37-3.23, p less than 0.01) when group A was used as the control (the approach used in previous studies), and 2.66 (95% CI 1.74-4.06, p less than 0.01) with group B as the control (the approach recommended by critics of previous studies). Markers of chronic asthma severity were associated with asthma death when control group B was used, but not when control group A was used (which indicates that these markers were indirectly matched for when control group A was used). Information was also collected on various markers of acute asthma severity and prescription of psychotropic drugs, but it was found that these were not important confounders. These findings address the major criticisms of previous case-control studies of this issue, and add support to the hypothesis that inhaled fenoterol increases the risk of death in patients with severe asthma.\n",

Compliance was poor, but similar, in both trials. Patients took the study drug as instructed on a mean of 37.3% days (range 10% to 77%) in one trial and 37.4% days (range 0% to 63%) in the other. Both underuse and overuse were observed. Underuse was seen on a mean of 38.9% days (range 9% to 81%) and 46.0% (range 15% to 80%) respectively; overuse on a mean of 23.5% days (range 6% to 54%) and 16.6% days (range 0% to 41%). In some patients ten or more activations of the device were recorded at the same time. In six patients such multiple simultaneous activations were recorded on two or more separate days. These patients were among the most noncompliant in the study. Multiple simultaneous activations frequently followed underuse days or preceded followup visits, suggesting the possibility of duplicity. Overall compliance was such that valid conclusions about efficacy of the drugs could only have been drawn in six of 34 patients.\n",

Although the causes of these disorders have not been completely elucidated, it seems that environmental and genetic factors in addition to central nervous system biochemical abnormalities play important roles. Mild to moderate anxiety levels may prove advantageous in the management of asthmatics but when their anxiety level becomes maladaptive, as in the case of panic attacks, their medical care is placed in jeopardy. Herein are three case reports of asthmatics who also exhibited panic disorders and their clinical outcome.

      "ABSTRACT Improved stability in oral delivery of albuterol provides less variability in bronchodilation in adults with asthma.The objective of this randomized, single-blind, parallel group study was to determine whether a more constant rate of albuterol delivery from tablets provides less variability in bronchodilation. Thirty-eight adult patients were enrolled with FEV1 between 40% to 80% of predicted normal and greater than or equal to 15% reversibility. Eighteen patients received Volmax, 8 mg bid, and 20 patients received Proventil Repetabs, 8 mg (as two 4-mg tablets) bid. The magnitude and duration of bronchodilation were determined after the first dose and at steady state on treatment day 7 by measuring serial values of pulmonary function for 12 hours on each day. Interpatient variability in bronchodilation was calculated for each study day did not differ significantly between treatments, the interpatient variability in bronchodilation with Volmax was, on average, one-half of that experienced with Proventil Repetabs. Adverse events, mainly headache and tremor, were comparable between Volmax and Proventil Repetabs. This study demonstrates that Volmax achieves less variable bronchodilation through a more constant rate of drug delivery from the onset of therapy.\n",

The care of these patients is enhanced when the physician has established good rapport with the patient. The noncompliant, disruptive behavior of some patients can try the patience of even the most understanding physicians and, in turn, impede the delivery of care. Interactions with this type of patient may leave the physician with feelings of guilt, frustration, and helplessness. We review such an encounter with the purpose of describing how to deal with this type of patient and to guide the physician in responding to this adverse behavior. Such patients will usually require limits to be set on behavioral acting out for their own best interest. Further, it is often necessary to make continued care contingent on compliance with the ground rules set. The physician must be aware of his or her adverse feelings toward the patient and be able to interpret the behavior in the context of the psychiatric disorder so that appropriate psychologic help for the patient can be provided.\n",

Judgments of both parenting problems and maternal coping were made during a home visit when the infant was 3 weeks old. A clinical interview with the mother was developed and reliably coded. The sample was divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of concerns about coping and parenting. During the following 2 years, the respiratory status of the children was monitored. Four categories of respiratory status were defined: (1) asthma; (2) recurrent infectious wheezing; (3) a single isolated wheezing episode; or (4) no wheezing. Early problems in coping and parenting were associated with the later onset of asthma (p less than 0.001). Furthermore, parents of children who developed asthma were more likely to have been having difficulties at the 3-week visit than those whose children developed infectious wheezing (p less than 0.005).\n",

MZ twins, whether reared apart or together, showed a greater concordance than dizygotic twins reared apart or together.

Nausea and headache were the most common side effects (16-33% and 23-33% of the patients respectively on different regimens) with the lowest frequency on 2.0 mg/kg/20 min. Four additional hypotensive reactions occurred; one on each 2.0 mg/kg regimen and two on 2.5 mg/kg/20 min. The regimen 2.0 mg/kg20 min was found to be the most favourable with regard to efficacy and side effects. Enprofylline i.v. was found to be an effective bronchodilating treatment of acute airway obstruction but the frequency of side effects has to be considered.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The role of platelet-activating factor in asthma.There is a large body of in vitro, animal, and now human data that provide strong support for PAF as being an important mediator of asthma and airway hyperreactivity. Unfortunately, there is little direct, unequivocal evidence that this is so. Direct evidence will come from studies that test the effectiveness of potent, nontoxic, PAF receptor antagonists in patients with asthma. Another issue that needs to be addressed is the mechanism by which PAF produces bronchoconstriction and, in particular, airway hyperreactivity. Studies exploring the effect of PAF on inflammatory cell populations and functions in the lung, on other mediators (i.e., leukotrienes), and on the nonadrenergic, noncholinergic nervous system in human subjects are needed. Finally, identification of the basis for the variable response to PAF in normal subjects and in patients with asthma should provide further insight into PAF's mechanism of action and the pathogenesis of asthma and airway hyperreactivity.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The role of leukotriene antagonists and inhibitors in the treatment of airway disease.Since the early recognition that leukotrienes are generated in response to allergen exposure, a role for these multipurpose mediators has been sought. The pharmacologic actions of the leukotrienes and their cell sources were strong evidence that they should contribute to allergic airway disease. That promise is now being fulfilled. Potent leukotriene receptor antagonists and enzyme inhibitors of leukotriene generation are now being investigated. With the availability of these new compounds, not only will greater insight to leukotrienes in asthma become apparent, but possibly newer, more effective therapeutics. Of additional interest and relevance is the potential role of leukotrienes in other nonrespiratory inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis. Therefore, the role of leukotrienes in inflammation is not limited to the respiratory system but are more universal in their ability to cause tissue injury. Consequently, studies that have shown benefit from inhibition of leukotriene synthesis and antagonism of the LTD4 receptor in respiratory diseases are suggestive that such an approach will also be beneficial in other inflammatory diseases. For example, a study of 72 patients with A-64077 (zileuton) has demonstrated that 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors are efficacious in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. Therefore, the contribution of leukotrienes to inflammation is likely to be a global phenomenon, and the introduction of leukotriene antagonists and 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors may represent the beginning of a new era for the treatment of many inflammatory diseases.\n",

Despite impressive evidence potentially implicating the LTs, the role of LTs in asthma is still unproved, and a positive answer to their critical actions in causing airflow obstruction will require studies with specific antagonists.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Nebulized atropine sulfate in the treatment of acute asthma.Conflicting reports have appeared concerning the role of anticholinergic agents in the treatment of acute asthma. This study was designed to determine whether atropine sulfate, the only anticholinergic agent currently available in the United States for nebulization, increases bronchodilation when added to an inhaled beta-adrenergic agonist during the initial treatment of an acute asthma attack. Adults asthmatics (n = 40) with acute asthma attacks were randomized to receive metaproterenol (5 percent solution, 0.3 ml) either alone or with atropine sulfate (2.5 mg), by nebulization. Spirometry, vital signs, and the presence of side effects 0, 30, 60, and 120 minutes after treatment were determined. There were no significant differences between the metaproterenol alone and metaproterenol plus atropine sulfate groups in regard to age, duration of asthma, baseline spirometry, or side effects. No differences were noted between the two groups regarding changes in FEV1 and FVC from baseline (expressed in milliliters or as a percentage of baseline) during the observation period. We conclude that nebulized atropine sulfate yields no additional benefit when added to metaproterenol during the initial treatment of an acute asthma attack.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Facilitation of mechanical ventilation in status asthmaticus with continuous intravenous thiopental.Mechanical ventilation in status asthmaticus is associated with a significant mortality and morbidity. To facilitate intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV), we have used continuous IV thiopental (thiopentone) together with traditional ventilatory techniques. With this policy, we were able to achieve rapid correction of arterial blood gas tensions in a group of 20 severe asthmatics requiring IPPV. By 1 hour, peak airway pressure (PAP) had fallen from 58.6 +/- 15.7 to 30.2 +/- 10.9 cm H2O (p less than 0.001). During the same period, PaCO2 fell from 51.3 +/- 15.3 to 40.17 +/- 8.2 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and pH rose from 7.25 +/- 0.1 to 7.33 +/- 0.1 (p less than 0.001). Morbidity was low and in particular, no episode of barotrauma was noted. All patients survived the acute attack and were successfully liberated from the ventilator. We conclude that these results are largely attributable to our use of early and continuous IV anesthesia induced by thiopental.\n",

To evaluate their safety and efficacy, we compared epinephrine and theophylline combined with ephedrine with inhaled metaproterenol and the placebo. Twelve asthmatic patients were studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial comparing forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) after two inhalations of epinephrine (0.2 mg/inh), 1 minute apart, followed in 15 minutes by theophylline (130 mg) with ephedrine (24 mg) versus two inhalations of metaproterenol (0.65 mg/inh), 1 minute apart, versus placebo inhaler and tablets. Onset of FEV1 greater than 15% above baseline values occurred within 15 seconds after inhalations for 100% of epinephrine-treated patients, 92% of metaproterenol-treated patients, and 33% of placebo-treated patients. FEV1 responses were significantly greater (P less than .05) for epinephrine at 0.66 to 1.66 minutes compared with the responses of metaproterenol, and epinephrine and theophylline that was combined with ephedrine compared with metaproterenol beginning at 2 hours. Mean duration of activity was 5.7 hours for the epinephrine- and theophylline with ephedrine-treated patients, 4.9 hours for metaproterenol-treated patients, and 2 hours for the placebo group. There were statistically significant differences for patients receiving epinephrine and theophylline with ephedrine versus the placebo group (P less than .001), metaproterenol patients versus the placebo group (P = .02), and patients receiving epinephrine and theophylline with ephedrine versus metaproterenol-treated patients (P less than .05).

Twenty-one students with symptoms of CFS were identified. Two controls per case matched for age and sex were randomly selected from questionnaire respondents. Health status was verified for all subjects by telephone, and diagnosis of CFS was confirmed by a physician. Information was collected on the following factors: symptoms of CFS among other family members; history of allergy/asthma; consumption of raw milk, raw eggs, raw cheese, or raw meat; water supply; exposure to animals; home heating source; proximity to farmland/orchards; tick bite; blood transfusion; camping; and appendicitis. Logistic-regression analyses indicated that the best model (characterized by symptoms among other family members, recent ingestion of raw milk, and history of allergy/asthma) produced significant estimates of relative risk (P less than .05) of 35.9, 44.3, and 23.3, respectively, for the three factors (corrections were made for the effect of the other covariates).

      "ABSTRACT The significance of late responses in asthma.There is good evidence to suggest that the late response is a valid clinical model of asthma. The factors which predict late responses in individual subjects are unknown although recent studies suggest that the level of IgE sensitivity and allergen dose are two important variables. Recent placebo-controlled pharmacological studies support earlier work and vindicate the use of late responses as a preclinical screening test in the evaluation of new therapeutic agents. In addition to putative pro-inflammatory mechanisms we should evaluate possible protective mechanisms which might prevent the development of late responses in individual subjects. In this regard, altered adrenal responses as reflected by serum cortisol concentrations did not appear to play a role, protective or otherwise in the development of late asthmatic responses. In conclusion, the development of symptomatic late responses and associated increased bronchial responsiveness are relevant to day-to-day asthma. As suggested by Cockcroft, repeated allergen exposure may result in a vicious cycle of ongoing bronchial inflammation. This emphasizes the importance of allergen avoidance and the need for earlier intervention in mild to moderate asthma with effective prophylactic agents which are known to inhibit late responses.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Expression of mRNA for interleukin-5 in mucosal bronchial biopsies from asthma.We have attempted to identify mRNA for IL-5 in endobronchial mucosal biopsies from asthmatics and controls, using the technique of in situ hybridization. Bronchial biopsies were obtained from 10 asthmatics and 9 nonatopic normal controls. A radio-labeled cRNA probe was prepared from an IL-5 cDNA and hybridized to permeabilized sections. These were washed extensively before processing for autoradiography. An IL-5-producing T cell clone derived from a patient with the hyper-IgE syndrome was used as a positive control. As a negative control, sections were also treated with a \"sense\" IL-5 probe. Specific hybridization signals for IL-5 mRNA were demonstrated within the bronchial mucosa in 6 out of the 10 asthmatic subjects. Cells exhibiting hybridization signals were located beneath the epithelial basement membrane. In contrast, there was no hybridization in the control group. No hybridization was observed with the sense probe. The six IL-5 mRNA-positive asthmatics tended to have more severe disease than the negative asthmatics, as assessed by symptoms and lung function, and showed a significant increase in the degree of infiltration of the bronchial mucosa by secreting (EG2+) eosinophils and activated (CD25+) T lymphocytes. Within the subjects who showed positive IL-5 mRNA, there was a correlation between IL-5 mRNA expression and the number of CD25+ and EG2+ cells and total eosinophil count. This study provides evidence for the cellular localization of IL-5 mRNA in the bronchial mucosa of asthmatics and supports the concept that this cytokine regulates eosinophil function in bronchial asthma.\n",

There was a good clinical effect. The changes observed may be attributed to decreasing EM viscosity improving the function of adenylate cyclase and to the action of glucocorticosteroids on phospholipase A2 by rising PL values.

Challenge testing was terminated when the FEV1 fell by 20% or a concentration of 10 mg/ml was reached. Participants were separated into three groups: six asthmatics hyperresponsive to adenosine (Group 1), seven asthmatics hyperresponsive to histamine but not adenosine (Group 2), and six normal subjects (Group 3). The mean percentage increase in NCA was 84% for Group 1 (p less than 0.001), 29% for Group 2 (p less than 0.05), and only 13% for Group 3. No significant increase in NCA was observed after histamine challenge in seven individuals with asthma derived from Groups 1 and 2. Four patients from Group 1 were rechallenged after treatment with therapeutic doses of oral theophylline. Theophylline therapy was associated with a significant attenuation of the increase in NCA at the concentration of adenosine which caused a 20% decrease in FEV1 before treatment (18% versus 84%, p less than 0.01). The concentration of adenosine which caused a 20% drop in FEV1 was increased at least twofold for each of the four patients. Analysis of NCA by gel filtration chromatography demonstrated an increase in a high molecular weight neutrophil chemotactic factor in the serum of two Group 1 patients after adenosine challenge. Release of a high molecular weight neutrophil chemotactic factor is consistent with a mast cell source for inflammatory mediators in adenosine-induced bronchoconstriction. The therapeutic effects of theophylline, a potent adenosine antagonist, in asthma may therefore occur in part through the inhibition of this process.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Attenuation of inhaled allergen-induced airway microvascular leakage and airflow obstruction in guinea pigs by a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor (A-63162).Leukotrienes, products of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway in the metabolism of arachidonic acid, are potent mediators of airway microvascular leakage and smooth muscle contraction in guinea pigs. We studied the effect of a specific 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, A-63162, on airway microvascular leakage and airflow obstruction following inhaled ovalbumin in actively sensitized guinea pigs. Airway microvascular leakage was assessed by extravasation of Evans blue dye into airway tissues. Inhaled ovalbumin caused increased lung resistance (RL) with decreased dynamic compliance (CL) and increased extravasation of Evans blue dye at all airway levels. A-63162 reduced the changes in RL and CL at 1.0 mumol/kg (p less than 0.05) but not at lower doses of 0.1 and 0.3 mumol/kg. A-63162 reduced Evans blue dye extravasation in airway tissues at all three doses, however, being most effective in the distal airways (p less than 0.01), and these reductions were greater than those in RL and CL. A 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor thus reduced airway microvascular leakage to a greater extent than airflow obstruction, suggesting that leukotrienes have a larger contribution to changes in airway microvascular permeability than smooth muscle contraction following inhaled allergen challenge in actively sensitized guinea pigs in vivo.\n",

In addition, binding studies with (3H) dexamethasone have been performed to determine the dissociation constant (Kd) and receptor numbers (Ro) in the monocytes of these two groups of subjects. The concentration of corticosteroid producing 50% inhibition (IC50) was 600 nM, 70 nM, and 0.5 nM for hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, and dexamethasone, respectively, in monocytes from CS individuals. There was only weak inhibition of the generation of enhancing activity by the corticosteroids in the CR asthmatic individuals. The dexamethasone Kd was 2.45 +/- 0.58 nM (mean +/- SEM, n = 6) in the CS group and 1.6 +/- 0.35 nM (mean +/- SEM, n = 6) in the CR group of patients (p = 0.14).

There is increased inflammatory infiltrate comprising \"activated\" lymphocytes and eosinophils with release of granular content in the latter, and there is enlargement of bronchial smooth muscle, particularly in medium-sized bronchi. Three conditions contribute to COPD. In chronic bronchitis there is mucous hypersecretion with enlargement of tracheobronchial submucosal glands and a disproportionate increase of mucous acini. In small or peripheral airways disease, there is inflammation of bronchioli and mucous metaplasia and hyperplasia, with increased intraluminal mucus, increased wall muscle, fibrosis, and airway stenoses. Respiratory bronchiolitis is a critically important early lesion that may predispose to the development of centrilobular emphysema. The severity of emphysema, rather than type, appears to be the most important determinant of chronic deterioration of airflow, and in this there may be significant loss of elastic recoil prior to the observed morphologic destruction of the acinus.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The roles of inflammatory cells in the pathogenesis of asthma and of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Studies of the inflammatory processes in asthma and in COPD have been hindered by the imprecise definitions of these diseases, the uncertainty as to the location of the relevant inflammatory sites for these diseases within the lungs, and the difficulties in relating observed histopathologic changes to the effects of particular proinflammatory leukocytes or their products. Circumstantial evidence exists implicating neutrophils, eosinophils, mast cells, and monocytes in asthma pathogenesis based on increased numbers and activation of these cells in blood, BAL fluid, or biopsy material, and the propensity of these cells to release products causing tissue damage. There is increasing evidence that the accumulation and activation of these cells is orchestrated by lymphokines elaborated by sensitized T lymphocytes. In COPD, attention has been focused on the secretion of proteases by infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages, although there is no incontrovertible evidence that these are relevant to the disease pathogenesis in the majority of patients with normal serum concentrations of protease inhibitors. In the future, studies of the functions of inflammatory cells actually at the sites of inflammation using the techniques of immunocytochemistry and molecular biology may provide further information as to the role of these cells in the inflammatory processes associated with asthma and COPD.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The increased responsiveness to inhaled methacholine in asthma: combination of causative factors.In asthma the dose-response curve to inhaled methacholine (MCh) is shifted leftwards and shows an increased slope and maximum. Two factors might contribute to the different form and position of this curve: (1) mediator-induced airway muscle hypersensitivity and (2) thickening of the airway wall. We attempted to estimate the effect of a combination of these two factors on the increase in airway resistance of a single isolated human airway to increasing concentrations of MCh. The result suggests that mediator-induced hypersensitivity to cholinergic stimuli may explain a small part of the leftward shift of the asthmatic dose-response curve to MCh, especially at lower levels of bronchoconstriction, and that increased thickness of the airway wall may be more important for the increased slope and maximum of the asthmatic dose-response curve.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Relationship of airway hyperresponsiveness to respiratory symptoms and diurnal peak flow variation in patients with obstructive lung disease. The Dutch CNSLD Study Group.This study reports on the relationship of airway hyperresponsiveness (AH) with respiratory symptoms and diurnal peak flow expiratory (PEF) variation in 221 hyperresponsive patients with moderately severe airways obstruction. The disease was in a stable phase in all patients. Closely adhering to the American Thoracic Society criteria, patients were divided into three syndrome diagnoses based on a standardized history: asthma (n = 81), asthmatic bronchitis (AB, n = 69), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [( COPD] n = 44); 27 subjects could not be placed in any group. Mean (+/- SEM) log2 PC20 histamine values were significantly lower in the asthmatic group (-2.77 +/- 0.20 mg/ml) than in the COPD (-0.89 +/- 0.29 mg/ml) and AB groups (-1.37 +/- 0.25 mg/ml; one-way ANOVA, p less than 0.001). However, considerable overlap of individual responses existed. Differences between the groups could not be attributed to differences in prechallenge FEV1 levels. For every level of FEV1, asthmatic subjects were more hyperresponsive than patients with COPD. The dependence of PC20 on prechallenge FEV1 was comparable in all groups. There was a significant correlation between the degree of AH and diurnal PEF variation (rho = -0.401, p less than 0.001), which was stronger in asthma (rho = -0.409) than in COPD (rho = -0.325). Despite this obvious association, a wide range of diurnal PEF variation values existed for every level of PC20, indicating that PEF variability and AH are not interchangeable. The relationships between symptoms and both AH levels and PEF variation were weak. No significant differences were found between syndrome diagnosis groups with respect to diurnal PEF variation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "ABSTRACT Total respiratory resistance and reactance in patients with asthma, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema.A comparison was made of total respiratory resistance (Rrs) and reactance (Xrs) determined between 6 and 26 Hz by means of a forced oscillation technique in 27 patients with asthma (group A), 28 patients with chronic bronchitis (group B), and 20 patients with emphysema (group E) to examine whether the method can provide data capable of distinguishing among these diseases. The three groups demonstrated a similar reduction in the FEV1. In addition, static and dynamic lung volumes, maximal expiratory flows, diffusing capacity for CO, airway resistance (Raw), and elastic lung recoil were measured. The observed alterations of Rrs and Xrs consisted of an increase in Rrs, a decrease in Rrs with frequency, and a decrease in Xrs. However, significant differences were found between the three groups: Rrs at 6 Hz and average Rrs were most increased in group A, whereas the negative frequency dependence of Rrs and the decrease in Xrs were least pronounced in group E. In all groups Rrs at 6 Hz, the average slope of Rrs, and the average level of Xrs were tightly interrelated and showed in addition a high correlation with airway resistance; the correlations with FEV1 were less satisfactory. Discriminant analysis performed on the complete set of data, excluding diffusing capacity and elastic lung recoil, which were used as selection criteria, demonstrated that forced oscillation parameters were the most important factors discriminating among the groups.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Blood eosinophilia and FEV1. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses.A previous cross-sectional analysis of 1980 data from a population of working men in the Paris area has shown a significant relationship of blood eosinophilia to a reduced FEV1 among nonsmokers, remaining after excluding men with a history of asthma. In the present report, we reexamine this relationship, after taking into account asthma, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and positive skin prick tests, using data collected in 1985 in a subsample of 363 men from the initial population. Blood eosinophilia, defined by 5% or more eosinophils or by 250 or more eosinophils per cubic millimeter appeared to be associated with a lower FEV1, primarily in nonsmokers. A difference of approximately 0.40 L was observed in never-smokers with eosinophilia (greater than or equal to 5% of eosinophils) compared with those without. This association persisted after exclusion of subjects with atopy, asthma, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Longitudinally, no significant association was observed between 1980 eosinophilia and the annual FEV1 decline between 1980 and 1985, even in nonsmokers. The results of our cross-sectional analyses suggest that asthma or asthma-like disorder does not explain the association between eosinophilia and FEV1. The role of eosinophil in respiratory disorders may go beyond its intervention in allergy. Further longitudinal studies are needed to better understand discrepancies between cross-sectional and longitudinal data and whether eosinophilia is a risk factor for chronic air-flow limitation.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Changes in mucociliary clearance during acute exacerbations of asthma.Previous studies have suggested that mucociliary clearance (MC) is impaired in asthmatic subjects. If so, impaired clearance may be an important factor in acute exacerbation. We proposed that if MC plays a significant role in acute illness, MC should be impaired during the exacerbation but improve after recovery. To test this hypothesis, five asthmatic patients with attacks requiring hospitalization underwent measurement of MC using radiolabeled aerosol and a gamma camera. They were studied on the second or third day after admission with repeat measurements after discharge. Spirometry was performed before all studies. After an equilibrium xenon scan (133Xe), which defined lung borders and measured regional volume, radiolabeled saline particles containing technetium-labeled (99mTC) sulfur colloid were deposited and used to label airway mucus. Deposition patterns were matched by regulating particle distribution and breathing pattern. MC was then measured as percentage retention of radioactivity at 10-min intervals for 2 h. When hospitalized, 96.0 +/- 2.06% (SEM) of the initial radioactivity was retained in the lung after 2 h, indicating little clearance of mucus from the lung. In fact, no significant changes were detected when activity at 120 min was compared with measurements at 10 min (99.2 +/- 0.22%, NS). After discharge clearance was markedly enhanced. That is, retention of lung activity was significantly lower at all time intervals from 10 min onward, with only 70.9 +/- 3.86% retained at 120 min (p = 0.008). During an asthmatic attack warranting hospital admission, MC is significantly impaired, with marked improvement following recovery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "ABSTRACT Occupational asthma caused by exposure to neurospora in a plywood factory worker.A 24 year old man developed severe asthma two years after starting to work in a plywood plant. Four years later the patient had to stop working because of the increasing severity of his asthma. Three months after leaving his job, the patient's asthma was greatly improved. His job consisted of placing plywood sheets into a drying machine. The plywood sheets had stayed outside in wet conditions for at least four to six weeks and were usually covered with moulds. Drying the plywood sheets changed the mould into a fine orange powder. Exposure to this in the laboratory induced an isolated immediate asthmatic reaction. The same reaction was seen when the patient was challenged with an extract of the mould powder at a 0.1% w/v concentration. Skin prick test with the mould extract induced a weal and flare reaction and IgE antibodies against the dry mould powder were identified. A control patient with the same degree of bronchial hyperreactivity did not have any asthmatic reaction when challenged with the same mould extract. Culture of the dry mould powder on Sabouraud agar plates grew pure Neurospora sp. This mould has not been previously reported as a cause of occupational asthma. The immunological mechanism is probably related to an IgE mediated mast cell allergy.\n",

It is important to understand the pathophysiology of asthma and the rationale and options for treatment. Asthma, a reversible syndrome of airflow obstruction, is not simply spasm of airway smooth muscle; rather, it is a disease characterized by mucosal edema, mucous hypersecretion, and epithelial damage in the airway. Appropriate medical therapy includes treatment with compounds that specifically suppress airway inflammation. The best approach to treatment may be an anti-inflammatory agent--preferably by inhalation--along with an inhaled direct bronchodilator, with objective measures of airflow limitation to assess disease severity.\n",

      "ABSTRACT An open-label study of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin in severe childhood asthma.Eight pediatric patients with severe steroid-dependent asthma were enrolled in an open-label trial of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in an attempt to decrease their steroid requirements. Monthly therapy with high-dose IVIG resulted in a threefold decrease in both maintenance oral corticosteroid dose and in extra oral corticosteroids needed for control of exacerbations of asthma. This was accompanied by significant improvements in peak expiratory flow rates and in symptom-score rating. An immunomodulatory effect of IVIG was suggested by the changes in immediate skin test reactivity. Seven of the eight patients demonstrated one or more reactions to a panel of allergens before therapy. During the course of the trial, there was a progressive diminution in skin test reactivity with a 100-fold reduction in sensitivity at the completion of 6 months of therapy. In this preliminary study, the reduction in steroid requirements, improvement in symptoms and peak flow measurements, and diminution in immediate skin test reactivity support a potential role for IVIG in the treatment of severe steroid-dependent asthma. A larger, randomized trial now appears warranted.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Asthma symptoms, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and atopy in a Maori and European adolescent population.In 1989 a survey of 543 New Zealand rural adolescents of largely Maori descent was undertaken to determine the prevalence of asthma symptoms, bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) and atopy. The overall prevalence of asthma was estimated at 13.7%, BHR at 13.4% and atopy at 31.1%. These rates were similar across the age range 13 to 18 years. The prevalence of BHR among those without asthma symptoms was 3%. Both current asthma symptoms and BHR were more common among females, but there was no difference between the sexes in the proportion with atopy. The prevalence of asthma symptoms was higher among Maoris than nonMaoris, but this difference disappeared when allowance was made for current smoking. There was a similar prevalence of BHR and atopy between these two ethnic groups. There was a similar prevalence of asthma but lower prevalence of BHR than was reported among 7-10 year olds in an urban Auckland survey. The low prevalence of BHR among those without asthma symptoms, and the uniform frequency of asthma symptoms, BHR and atopy over the age range suggest that adolescents would be a particularly useful population for national or international comparisons of the prevalence of asthma, BHR and atopy.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Relation between nocturnal symptoms and changes in lung function on lying down in asthmatic children.Nocturnal symptoms are common in young asthmatic children. Such symptoms may be caused by increased impairment of lung function when they adopt the supine posture. Thirty one children aged 2.8-8.3 years were studied, of whom 20 had asthma (10 with frequent nocturnal symptoms) and 11 had no respiratory problems (control subjects). Peak expiratory flow (PEF) was measured with a Wright's peak flow meter and functional residual capacity (FRC) by a helium gas dilution technique after 30 minutes of lying supine; the values were compared with FRC measured sitting and PEF standing. Peak flow fell significantly on adoption of the supine posture in the asthmatic children, but there was no difference in this fall between the asthmatic children with and without nocturnal symptoms. FRC also fell on adoption of the supine posture, but the decrease in FRC was significant only in the control children and the asthmatic children without nocturnal symptoms. The failure to find a greater fall in PEF or a greater change in FRC on adoption of the supine posture among asthmatic children with nocturnal symptoms suggests that mechanisms other than increased impairment of lung function are responsible for nocturnal asthma.\n",

Bronchodilators still form the mainstay of treatment for all categories of asthma. However, only anti-allergic drugs and corticosteroids can modify inflammation and long-term usage offers the hope of suppression of the disease and prevention of progressive airway obstruction.

      "ABSTRACT [Rabbit immunization to induce experimental asthma--relationship between antigens and airway reactivity].Japanese white rabbits were immunized with either alternaria or ragweed starting at birth to induce experimental asthmatic model. We studied the characteristics of contractile responses of tracheal smooth muscle isolated from these sensitized animals and compared them with non-sensitized control animals. Both sensitivity and reactivity of contraction induced by acetylcholine (ACh) were increased in the alternaria sensitized group, but only sensitivity was increased in the ragweed group. Contractile responses to electrical field stimulation were enhanced in both sensitized groups, and responses in the alternaria group were significantly greater than those in the ragweed group. In the alternaria group, atropine suppressed the contractile response to KCl, indicating that the contraction was mediated partially through a muscarinic mechanism. In the ragweed group, atropine suppressed responses to 20 mM KCl. Stimulation of the intramural nerve plexus facilitated the release of neurotransmitters, especially ACh. This was more obvious in the alternaria group than in the ragweed group. These results suggest that alternaria sensitization of rabbits produces a better model for studying changes in interaction between nerves and smooth muscle in the airway.\n",

There were not significant correlations between airborne chironomid allergen and weathers (temperature, wind speed and precipitation) during or just before air sampling. 4) In Toyama, the frequency of asthma attacks in the asthmatic children with positive C.p. RAST was much increased in summer compared with that of the negative, in which the amount of airborne chironomid allergen was increased. These results show that there is large amount of chironomid allergen in the air from spring to autumn, especially large in summer, and it is related for some asthmatics to the increase of the frequency of asthma attack.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Repeated provocation tests in asthmatic children for testing tachyphylaxis to histamine.Tachyphylaxis to histamine was investigated in 16 children, aged 7-15 years, with mild asthma. Three consecutive histamine challenges were performed at intervals of 24 hours and 1 hour, respectively. No significant differences in IVC, FEV1, and PC20-histamine values between the three measurements were observed. After a 24 hour interval there was no difference in percentage fall of FEV1, but there was a slight (not significant) decrease in fall of FEV1 after a 1 hour interval. The PC20-histamine values showed good reproducibility with a 24 hour as well as with a 1-hour period between the tests (geometric mean PC20, 2.04 mg/mL +/- 3.50 %SD, 1.96 mg/mL +/- 4.37 %SD, 2.17 mg/mL +/- 4.12 %SD; correlation coefficients for a 24 hour interval, r = 0.87 and for a one-hour interval, r = 0.94 (P less than 0.01]. We conclude that in children there is no strong evidence for tachyphylaxis to histamine. Our results differ from studies on tachyphylaxis in adult asthmatics. Possibly different mechanisms exist in children and in adults.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Acute effect of passive smoking on lung function and airway responsiveness in asthmatic children.The effect of a 1-hour exposure at rest during passive cigarette smoking (20 ppm CO) or Sham was investigated in 11 children with bronchial asthma (age range, 8-13 yr; ten boys, one girl). Nine of the subjects were on regular therapy with inhaled beta 2-agonists and disodium cromoglycate. Both drugs were withheld at least 6 hours prior to each study session. Exposure was performed in an environmental chamber. Before and immediately after exposure, lung function and symptom scores were determined. After exposure, a histamine inhalation challenge was performed to determine the concentrations that caused a 100% increase in SRaw (PC100SRaw) and a 20% fall in FEV1, (PC20FEV1). Mean (SD) SRaw before and after Sham was 8.7 (3.6) and 9.0 (3.2) cmH2O.s, and mean FEV1 (SD) was 1.97 (0.32) and 1.98 (0.40) L, respectively. Before and after cigarette smoking, mean SRaw (SD) was 10.4 (5.3) and 9.4 (3.3) cmH2O.s, and mean FEV1 (SD) was 1.95 (0.37) and 1.94 (0.35 L, respectively. Geometric mean (SD) PC100 SRaw and PC20FEV1 after Sham was 1.39 (3.0) and 0.70 (2.7) mg/mL, and after passive smoking 1.65 (2.5) and 0.96 (2.3) mg/mL, respectively. There were no statistical differences in lung function and PC values between Sham and passive cigarette smoking. The main symptoms during passive smoking were irritation of the eye and the nasopharynx. Our observations suggest that in children with mild bronchial asthma 1 hour of passive cigarette smoking does not cause consistent changes of lung function and bronchial responsiveness.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Can asthma be cured?1. There is much evidence that many asthmatics lose their symptoms for long periods and are in this sense 'cured'. 2. The factors leading to restitution of normally reactive healthy airways are multiple and only partially understood. 3. Attempts at cure are likely to require a multi-faceted approach where inducers and sensitizers of asthma are reduced as far as possible at the same time as stimulating biological factors whose function is to preserve normal patho-physiology of the airways. 4. Identification of these controlling factors requires intensive study using naturally occurring models of individuals who have and have not gone into remission. 5. Whether anti-asthma medication will help usefully in redressing the balance or whether by inhibiting the stimulus for the production of inherent biological controlling factors, they actually mitigate against persisting remission (i.e. 'cure') needs urgent study. Such a possibility might account for some of the remarkable inconsistencies in epidemiological studies currently being reported. In particular, while medications for the control of asthma have improved dramatically over the last twenty years, the prevalence and perhaps mortality rates from asthma are actually rising. However until evidence is much firmer, the dangers of undertreating asthma must be recognized.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Refractoriness for ultrasonically nebulized distilled water and histamine after histamine challenge.Refractoriness for bronchial provocation frequently occurs after different challenge tests used to assess bronchial hyperresponsiveness in asthmatic patients. We investigated whether histamine inhalation could cause refractoriness for bronchoconstriction induced by ultrasonically nebulized distilled water (UNDW) and whether histamine causes tachyphylaxis for a subsequent histamine challenge in nine stable asthmatic patients. Preinhalation of histamine induced a significant diminished bronchoconstrictor response to UNDW cumulative dose of inhaled UNDW causing a 20% fall in forced expired volume in 1 s. The mean increased from 3.5 +/- 0.8 to 11.8 +/- 2.6 (SE) ml after histamine challenge (P less than 0.01). However, repeated inhalation of histamine did not change the bronchoconstrictor response to histamine within 1 h after rechallenge (P greater than 0.5). The magnitude of refractoriness for UNDW inhalation after preinhalation of histamine was correlated to the bronchoconstrictor response to histamine (r = 0.73, P less than 0.05). We conclude that inhaled histamine can induce refractoriness for UNDW, which seems to be related to the degree of bronchial hyperresponsiveness.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Relation between extent of bronchial reactivity and need for medication (therapy) in bronchial asthma in children].In 42 schoolchildren we have prospectively examined the relationship between the degree of bronchial responsiveness to methacholine and the treatment to control asthma. Following a standardized protocol for methacholine provocations we determined the provocation concentration causing a fall in FEV1 of 20% (PC20). Patients were grouped into 1 (n = 13), those who required no medication; 2 (n = 8), those who required beta 2-agonists on demand and 3, those who required beta 2-agonists and additional DSCG or topic steroids. Mean PC20 in group 1 was 3.55 mg/ml, in group 2 1.38 mg/ml and in group 3 0.37 mg/ml. There was a significant difference between each group. Generally spoken, those patients showing a high level of bronchial responsiveness to methacholine required more medications to control their asthma symptoms. However, an overlap of responsiveness in each treatment group was noted. The results of the present study show that measurement of airway responsiveness may be useful in some patients to better assess the necessary treatment to control asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Pulmonary reflexes after human heart-lung transplantation.Heart-lung transplantation involves denervation of the lungs below the tracheal anastomosis, with associated permanent loss of all pulmonary innervation except post-ganglionic efferent nerves. This is supported by loss of the cough reflex to inhaled USNDW, which also implies that the RARs which mediate this cough mechanism lie in the central airways. Bronchoconstriction following inhalation of USNDW developed only in those HLT recipients with acute lung rejection; this was not related to methacholine responsiveness and may therefore represent a pathologic vascular response. Hyperresponsiveness to methacholine has been reported following HLT, which we found unrelated to inflammation or acute rejection. A similar hyperresponsiveness to histamine was seen, which correlated with the response to methacholine. This also implies that histamine may act directly on smooth muscle receptors, and not solely via a cholinergic reflex. Hyperresponsiveness following HLT may be due to development of a generalized denervation hypersensitivity. Bronchodilation following capsaicin inhalation has been observed in HLT recipients, and may be due to unopposed release of VIP from retained post-ganglionic efferent nerves.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The effect of unproductive coughing/FET on regional mucus movement in the human lungs.The study was designed to ascertain the movement of mucus from proximal and peripheral regions within the human lungs during cough and the forced expiration technique (FET). Mucus movement was measured using a radioaerosol technique. Seven patients (mean +/- SEM age: 63 +/- 3 years) with airways obstruction (% predicted FEV1: 44 +/- 4) participated in the study. Each patient underwent three assessments in a randomized manner: control/cough/FET. Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) was measured at the mouth during cough and FET. None of the patients produced sputum during the assessment periods. Both cough and FET compared with control increased, on average, mucus clearance from all regions; statistical significance was achieved only for central lung regions with cough (P less than 0.05). There was no significant correlation between PEFR during cough/FET and regional lung clearance.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Coughing can relieve or exacerbate symptoms in asthmatic patients.From about 1190 to the present day opposing views have been expressed about the effects of coughing in patients with asthma. Some accounts have stated that it brought relief and others that it exacerbated asthma, whereas others thought that it could have both effects. In the present investigation, 187 patients with a clinical diagnosis of asthma were asked whether coughing relieved or exacerbated their asthma. In 41.7% coughing caused exacerbation, in 29.9% it brought relief, in 9.9% it had no effect, and in the remaining 18.7% it sometimes exacerbated their symptoms and sometimes brought relief. When asthma was exacerbated, the most common symptom induced was breathlessness, and then wheezing; chest tightness was the least frequent. When coughing brought relief it was mainly through the expectoration of sputum. However, a small proportion of patients found relief even if there was no expectoration. If coughing exacerbates asthma and persists in the face of treatment with standard medication, then treatment specifically directed at its diminution could reduce morbity considerably.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Bronchial asthma and kitchen salt].Epidemiological studies show considerable geographic differences in asthma prevalence and mortality. The regions with high prevalence and mortality are countries with Western-type culture and a high degree of technological progress. They differ from less technically developed countries in a number of ways, including their higher salt intake. Air pollution is often given as the cause of the high prevalence of asthma in the industrialized countries. Against this, it must be pointed out that in the urban agglomerations of the developing countries and in rural areas where heating is by means of open fireplaces (indoor pollution), there is also considerable air pollution. Migration studies from New Zealand and South Africa, where asthma prevalence increases parallel to salt intake, provide evidence that other factors arising from westernization and urbanization play a role. In the industrialized countries England and USA there is also a clear connection between salt intake and asthma: the greater the salt consumption, the higher the asthma prevalence and mortality. On the basis of these observations, the following questions were investigated: (1.) Does salt loading worsen the clinical and functional findings in asthmatics? (2.) Is the sodium or the chloride in salt the more important? To answer these questions, the effect of salt loading (+6.1 +/- 2.8 g NaCl/d = 105 +/- 48 mmol Na), salt restriction, and loading with sodium citrate in equimolar concentrations (+140 +/- 40 ml Shohl's solution = 120 +/- 34 mmol Na) was investigated in 14 asthmatics in a controlled crossover study. Statistical analysis showed that salt intake worsened symptoms (p = 0.06) and increased the use of inhaled steroids (p less than or equal to 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

The trial was designed as a prospective single-blind study of the effect of budesonide in daily doses of 200 microgram through 400 microgram to 800 micrograms in three randomized consecutive periods of 8 weeks. The unstimulated diurnal production of cortisol was assessed by measurement of free cortisol in 24-hour urine samples at the end of each period. No significant dose-related suppression was found. The cortisol production did not differ significantly during treatment with 800 microgram budesonide as compared to treatment with 200 microgram budesonide (95% confidence interval: 74%-112%).

Leukotriene C4 and D4 was detected in five patients during remission at 50.68 +/- 8.28 and 36.68 +/- 17.31 pg/mL (mean +/- SD), respectively. In five control subjects, the amounts of leukotriene C4 and D4 were 78.22 +/- 34.65 and 55.06 +/- 13.54 pg/mL (mean +/- SD), respectively. As cited in our previous report, the amounts of leukotriene C4 and D4 in arterial blood of asthmatic patients during acute asthma were 523.33 +/- 737.06 and 495 +/- 304.48 pg/mL. Hence, there were no significant differences in the leukotriene C4 and D4 values between asthmatic patients during remission and control subjects, whereas there was a significant difference in the leukotriene D4 values between asthmatic patients during acute asthma and, asthmatic patients during remission or control subjects (P less than .01). In addition, the leukotriene C4 values in asthmatic patients during acute asthma were larger than in asthmatic patients during remission or control subjects without a significant difference. The amounts of leukotriene C4 and D4 in arterial blood of asthmatic patients may reflect the degree of severity of acute asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Pharmacist advice to asthmatics regarding antihistamine use.Due to the frequency of asthmatics having concurrent allergic symptoms, patients may seek relief from antihistamines, which are currently labeled with warnings against their use in asthmatics. A survey was conducted in the Chicago area to evaluate the advice rendered by pharmacists regarding the use of antihistamines in asthmatics and their opinions about the current product labeling. Thirty percent of the surveys were returned. Nearly half (48%) of the surveyed pharmacists advise their asthmatic customers to avoid antihistamines and 75% of this group recommend avoidance because they believe antihistamines worsen asthmatic symptoms, despite the lack of sufficient clinical data to support this concern. Only 17% of pharmacists advise that antihistamines pose no problems for asthmatics. The latter group is the most aware that there is controversy surrounding the current labeling. Overall, half the pharmacists surveyed believe the current labeling is not appropriate for patients with asthma. Until the labeling is revised, physicians should be aware that pharmacists may advise their asthmatics against using antihistamines even though antihistamines should be only contraindicated in cases of proven adverse reactions.\n",

Order effects (evaluation at high steroid day first versus low steroid day first) were not significant for these steroid-sensitive variables. No dose-related changes emerged on measures of hyperactivity, attention, impulsivity, or fine motor control. Five subject variables were examined as potential risk factors. No association emerged between psychologic change scores and age, socioeconomic status, IQ, or asthma severity. Significant findings indicated that, as children increasingly demonstrated emotional difficulty or were from dysfunctional families, they were more likely to experience negative psychologic changes associated with high-dose steroids.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Asthma and airway hyperresponsiveness.Airway hyperresponsiveness to a large number of stimuli is a characteristic of asthma in humans. Various components of the tracheobronchial tree might contribute to this characteristic, such as smooth muscle, the bronchial epithelium, various neurohumoral mechanisms, and the mechanical linkages between the lung parenchyma and the airways. The degree of responsiveness can be further increased by a series of stimuli associated with inflammation in the periphery of the lung. Such stimuli actually induce an asthmatic state or heighten the vulnerability of asthmatics, making them more prone to overt attacks in response to minor stimuli that would ordinarily be well tolerated. Depending upon the inciting stimulus, different cells and mediators may be playing a role in producing and perpetuating the inflammatory state and producing further increases in responsiveness.\n",

Ninety patients were randomly assigned to receive cimetidine or an identical placebo or to undergo antireflux surgery. During a six-month period, all groups improved clinically; the cimetidine and surgical groups improved more than the placebo group. The intake of pulmonary medication decreased significantly in both cimetidine and surgical groups. Pulmonary function test results improved in the cimetidine- and surgically treated patients; improvement was not statistically significant. At long-term follow-up, the surgical group maintained clinical improvement and decreased pulmonary medication intake, whereas the placebo group worsened.

The following dosages were administered with an interval of 1 h: 12-24-48-(48)-(48) micrograms for F and 100-200-400-400-(400)-(400) micrograms for S. The study day was discontinued if pulse rate was above 140 beats min-1, a flattening of T wave on the ECG was recorded, or a maximal bronchodilation in FEV1 was observed (above 110 percent of the predicted value or an increase in FEV1 in the last two measurements below 5 percent). The maximal individual dose of F administered was 84 micrograms in six patients, 132 micrograms in three patients, 180 micrograms in three patients, and 228 micrograms in one patient. For S, the maximal individual dose was 400 micrograms in three patients, 2,200 micrograms in eight patients, 3,000 micrograms in one patient, and 3,800 micrograms in one patient. The mean maximal increase in FEV1 was 36.0 percent after F and 35.1 percent after S. Pulse rate increased from 73 to S3 beats.min-1 after F and from 75 to 84 beats.min-1 after S (both statistically significant). No pulse rate above 140 beats.min-1 was observed. In the high-therapeutic range (up to 36 micrograms of F and 6,090 micrograms of S), no changes in potassium level were observed. In still higher dosages, mean potassium level decreased from 4.16 to 3.78 mmol.L-1 after F and from 4.02 to 3.88 mmol.L-1 after S (not clinically relevant). The lowest individual potassium level recorded was 3.1 mmol.L-1. No clinically important changes in ECG were observed. In conclusion, very high doses of F and S administered from a metered dose inhaler proved to be safe for patients.\n",

Amongst other findings were: That one third on the children and youths had not taken part in sports, either at school or in their leisure time, that they had missed a lot of school (33 children had missed over 30%) and that the children and youths were an average of 1.29 years behind the normal school level. The investigation leads to the conclusion that the schooling situation of asthmatic children and youths should be taken into consideration within the chronic asthma treatment plan and that treatment periods that last too long bring about an irreversible school deficiency which could hinder the further development of the youth.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Trends in the frequency of hospitalization for asthma and chronic obstructive lung disease in The Netherlands, 1980-1988].National hospital admission frequencies were analysed for asthma (ICD-9 code 493) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (ICD-code 490 + 491 + 492 + 496) for 1980-1988 by sex and according to age (0-4, 5-34, 35-64, and greater than or equal to 65 years). Rates per million of the population per year were calculated and time trend analyses performed by least square regression. The admission rate for asthma showed a decrease in the total male and female population, as was the case in all age groups, except for the age group 0-4 years in which a significant increase was found. For COPD an increase was observed in total admissions in males and females, due to a substantial increase in the age group greater than or equal to 65 years, while in females the increase in the age group 35-64 years also contributed. The striking increase in hospitalisation for asthma in young children needs further attention, as does the increase in hospital admissions for COPD in older people, particularly with respect to women, for whom continuing rising trends can be expected.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Theophylline and status epilepticus in children.We studied the role of theophylline on outcome of status epilepticus (SE) in children. During a two-year-period, 16 of 114 episodes of SE occurred in children receiving theophylline. At the onset of SE, theophylline blood levels were elevated in 8 episodes, and were therapeutic or subtherapeutic in 8 episodes. In the 8 episodes of SE with elevated theophylline levels, one child died and three suffered permanent new neurologic deficits. In the 8 episodes of SE with normal or low theophylline levels, only one child had a transient deficit. The occurrence of death or disability in 4 of 8 episodes of SE with elevated theophylline was considerably higher than the 23% incidence of death or persistent CNS deficit in the overall series of 114 episodes of SE. We conclude that theophylline, at toxic levels, is a significant factor in increased morbidity. We suspect that the hypoxia from the respiratory disorder for which theophylline was used, and the reduced cerebral blood flow known to occur with theophylline led to a failure to compensate for the increased cerebral metabolic rate of SE, thus increasing the risk of a poor outcome.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Histamine hyperresponsiveness of the extrathoracic airway in patients with asthmatic symptoms.Functional abnormalities of the extrathoracic airway (EA) may produce symptoms mimicking bronchial asthma. We assessed the bronchial (B) and EA responsiveness to inhaled histamine in 40 patients with asthmatic symptoms and in nine asymptomatic controls. FEV1 and maximal mid-inspiratory flow (MIF50) were used as index of bronchial and EA narrowing. Hyperresponsiveness of the intra-(BHR) or extra-(EA-HR) thoracic airway was diagnosed when the provocative concentrations of histamine (PC20FEV1 or PC25MIF50) were less than 8 mg/ml. Fiberoptic laryngoscopy was performed in nine patients and three controls. The glottal region was measured at mid-volume of maximal inspiration (AgMI) and expiration (AgME) before and after histamine. Predominant EA-HR was found in 13 patients, predominant BHR in 12, equivalent BHR and EA-HR in another 12; no significant airway narrowing was observed in three patients and in the nine controls. EA-HR was significantly associated with female sex, sinusitis, post-nasal drip, dysphonia; BHR with atopy, wheezing and lower MEF50. The percent change in AgMI after histamine was closely related to the PC25MIF50 (r = 0.87, P less than 0.001), that of AgME to the PC20FEV1 (r = 0.78, P less than 0.01). These findings suggest that the assessment of EA responsiveness may be useful in the evaluation of asthmatic symptoms, especially in patients with no BHR.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Use of the extended Phadebas RAST panel in the diagnosis of mould allergy in asthmatic children.The clinical significance of mould allergens in Phadebas RAST panel was investigated in 121 asthmatic children. They were selected from a total population of 1649 patients. The patients were distributed into four groups, based on the combination of positive or negative skin prick tests (SPT) together with symptoms suggestive or not of mould sensitivity. Mould-specific IgE antibodies were investigated using the original RAST panel (Alternaria, Aspergillus, Candida, Cladosporium, Mucor and Penicillium) and a set of 10 additional mould-allergen discs (Aureobasidium, Botrytis, Curvularia, Epicoccum, Fusarium, Helminthosporium, Phoma, Rhizopus, Stemphylium and Trichoderma). The set of additional RAST discs revealed patients with mould-reaginic antibodies not found with the original RAST panel. This occurred in four of 49 (8.2%) RAST positive (class greater than or equal to 2) patients. The allergens most frequently positive were Cladosporium (in 28% of the patients), Candida (28%) and Helminthosporium (26%). A remarkable degree of simultaneous reactivity to almost all moulds tested was observed. Patients with multiple (greater than or equal to 7) mould sensitization were effectively pinpointed using any duplicate combination of Aureobasidium, Botrytis, Candida, Cladosporium, Helminthosporium, Penicillium and Stemphylium.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Airway response to exercise and methacholine in children with respiratory symptoms.Thirty atopic and 30 non-atopic subjects were identified from a population of 7-8 year old children with current respiratory symptoms. The response of the airways to exercise and provocation by methacholine were compared. In these children, who had symptoms but were not necessarily asthmatic, there was no significant correlation between the two stimuli. The atopic children were, however, significantly more responsive than the non-atopic children to both. For the whole group, odds ratios derived for atopy and for an increased response to methacholine (expressed as a PD20--the dose that caused the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) to fall by 20%--of less than 6.4 mumol/l), a positive exercise test (greater than 15% fall in FEV1), and the presence of asthma were 13.5, 3.3, and 21.0, respectively; that for positive response to methacholine and positive exercise challenge was 1.5. Thus though increased bronchial responsiveness to methacholine and exercise challenge are both associated with a diagnosis of asthma, the association between the two stimuli is complex, and supports the view that they reflect entirely different components of airways dysfunction.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Is low birth weight a risk factor for asthma during adolescence?The effect of low birth weight on the incidence of asthma by 17 years of age was investigated by studying medical draft examination records of 20,312 male subjects born in Jerusalem between January 1967 and December 1971. Additional information on birth weight and other demographic factors was abstracted from the Jerusalem Perinatal Study computerised database. A stepwise multiple logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios for developing asthma by 17 years of age in 500 g birthweight categories from less than 2000 g to 4500 g. The odds ratios were adjusted for the confounding effects of ethnic origin, social class (determined by area of residence), paternal education, maternal age, and birth order. The group with low birth weights (less than 2500 g, n = 1004) had a significantly increased risk of developing asthma by 17 years of age, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.44 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 2.66) for birthweight group less than 2000 g and 1.49 (95% CI 1.05 to 2.12) for birthweight group 2000-2499 g compared with the reference group of 3000-3499 g. We conclude that infants with birth weights of less than 2500 g may have a higher risk of asthma during childhood and adolescence than infants who were heavier at birth.\n",

Delay in diagnosis, both in terms of time (median 2.95 years) and number of consultations (median 7), was considerable. Annual rates of consultations for respiratory symptoms that were initiated by the patients fell significantly after diagnosis (median before = 1.80, after = 0.95 consultations/year), but the number initiated by the doctors rose significantly (median before = 0, after = 1.01 consultations/year). The overall rates before and after diagnosis were not significantly different (median before = 2.04, after = 2.21 consultations/year).

      "ABSTRACT Occupational respiratory disease in the United Kingdom 1989: a report to the British Thoracic Society and the Society of Occupational Medicine by the SWORD project group.A voluntary scheme for the surveillance of work related and occupational respiratory disease (SWORD) was established in January 1989 with help from the British Thoracic Society and the Society of Occupational Medicine and support from the Health and Safety Executive. Three hundred and fifty four chest physicians representing 90% of the chest clinics in the United Kingdom and 361 occupational physicians submit reports regularly of newly diagnosed cases of work related respiratory illness with information on age, sex, residence, occupation, and suspected causal agent. In 1989 2101 cases were notified, of which frequent diagnoses were asthma (26%), mesothelioma (16%), pneumoconiosis (15%), benign pleural disease (11%), and allergic alveolitis (6%). Incidence rates calculated against denominators from the Labour Force Survey showed very large differences between occupational groups, especially for asthma and asbestos related diseases. Substantial regional variation in the incidence of asthma was not explained by the geographical distribution of high risk industries and was probably due to differing levels of ascertainment. The results imply that the true frequency of acute occupational respiratory disease in the United Kingdom may have been three times greater than that reported.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Factors relating to the development of respiratory symptoms in coffee process workers.After several cases of occupational asthma had been reported in a coffee processing factory in England, 197 coffee workers representing 80% of the production workforce were studied to determine the factors affecting the development of work related respiratory symptoms of wheeze, cough, and dyspnoea. Two computer administered questionnaires concerning the presence of respiratory symptoms and the occurrence of work related respiratory symptoms were used. Workers underwent skin prick testing to green coffee bean extract (GCB) and 11 common inhalant allergen extracts and bronchial provocation testing with methacholine. The presence of specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to GCB and castor bean extract (CAB) were determined by a radioallergosorbent test (RAST). The prevalence of work related respiratory symptoms was 12.7%, bronchial hyperresponsiveness 30%, atopy 54%, positive GCB skin prick test 14.7%, positive GCB RAST 14%, and positive CAB RAST 14.7%. None of the workers was sensitised to fungi present in the factory and the numbers of certain species of fungi, despite being greater than may be found out of doors or in an uncontaminated indoor environment, were fewer than are generally associated with the presence of work related respiratory symptoms among agricultural workers. Storage mites were not isolated. Green coffee bean extract and CAB RAST were significantly correlated using the McNemar test but there was limited allergenic cross reactivity in RAST inhibition studies of the two extracts. The only factors that were significantly and independently associated with work related symptoms were CAB RAST and duration of employment. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness was not independently associated with work related respiratory symptoms. The significant independent associations of bronchial hyperresponsiveness included GCB RAST, duration of employment, and resting forced expiratory volume in one second. Exposure to CAB, a highly potent antigen, may be overriding the effects of other factors such a GCB, atopy, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and smoking. This study suggests that CAB contamination remains a potential problem in the coffee processing industry and all efforts to eliminate it from the working environment should continue.\n",

The design was a register based cohort study where the smoking adjusted mortality due to asthma among Swedish men 1971-80 was investigated. For each occupation a smoking adjusted standardised mortality ratio (SMR) was calculated based on a linkage between official mortality statistics 1971-80 and occupational information in the 1970 national census. The information about the smoking habits among different occupations was obtained from a smoking survey carried out in 1963. In the statistical analysis only occupations with more than 10 deaths were considered. A significantly increased mortality from asthma was found among farmers (smoking adjusted SMR 137, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 115-156), farm workers (smoking adjusted SMR 170, 95% CI 107-235), woodworking machine operators (smoking adjusted SMR 226, 95% CI 108-344), clerical workers (smoking adjusted SMR 161, 95% CI 102-220), packers and labellers (smoking adjusted SMR 144, 95% CI 100-188), and watchmen (smoking adjusted SMR 212, 95% CI 104-320).

With this new information, therapeutic emphasis switched from primarily bronchodilator therapy to anti-inflammatory therapy. Concurrently, drugs with different delivery systems as well as higher dose agents were released, simplifying therapy for many patients. The result is a fairly dramatic reexamination of traditionally used medications and attempts to develop newer medications aimed at reducing asthma based on the newer proposed pathophysiological mechanisms. Future management of asthma likely will involve some newer medications as well as the education of the patient and his/her family concerning the behavior of asthma and appropriate steps to take when there is loss of usual asthma control.\n",

Therefore it may be necessary to administer the individual maximum dose of BDP to reduce bronchial inflammation. In 13 patients (2 males and 11 females, mean age 49.2 +/- 3.7 years old) with chronic asthma whose minimum %PEFRs were lower than 80% under treatment with conventional doses of BDP, the clinical benefit of high dose inhalation therapy with BDP was studied for four consecutive weeks by comparing % peak expiratory flow rate (%PEFR) measured four times a day both before and 10 minutes after inhaled procaterol (PCR) in a cross-over fashion. Mean morning %PEFRs before inhaled PCR during the first two weeks with a lower dose of BDP (419 +/- 24 micrograms/day) and during the following two weeks with a higher dose of BDP (904 +/- 55 micrograms/day) were 60.6 +/- 3.1% and 77.5 +/- 4.1%, respectively (p less than 0.01). Average increases in %PEFR during the higher dose period before and after inhaled PCR were 12.1% and 12.4%, respectively, which was observed by the end of the first week after the start of higher dose of BDP in 12 out of 13 patients. Since there were no adverse reactions such as hoarseness, oral thrush and candidiasis during the period with higher doses of BDP, it was concluded that we should promptly employ higher doses of BDP in patients who did not respond satisfactorily to conventional doses of BDP.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Structure activity hypotheses in occupational asthma caused by low molecular weight substances.Many substances with a low molecular weight (less than 1000 molecular weight) but of different chemical classes are recognized as causative agents of occupational asthma. Some of their major chemical properties are highlighted in relation to their putative interactions with human macromolecules. Thus, certain transition metals which form co-ordination complexes may chelate human proteins. Several organic substances have marked basic properties which are responsible for their chemical reactivity. Some of these, such as the bifunctional bases ethylene diamine, piperazine and para-phenylene diamine are known causative agents of asthma while their monofunctional counterparts, in spite of wide industrial application, are not similarly recognized causes. This suggests that the presence of multiple reactive groups is of importance in the molecular interactions with human macromolecules that eventually lead to occupational asthma. Reference is also made to other substances to exemplify hypothetical mechanisms of these interactions. Such generation of hypotheses is a prelude to quantitative studies of structure activity relationships (QSARs) where the hypotheses can be tested and revised. Structure activity hypotheses in isolation might not be adequate predictors of the risk of occupational asthma. However, if applied to novel chemical entities they might eventually prove useful in contributing to the development of policies for prospective health surveillance and in establishing priorities for epidemiological research.\n",

Final-year students had a mean score of 28.7 (range: 25-31) which was similar to a group of parents thought by their paediatricians to have a high level of knowledge about asthma (mean: 25.3, range: 18-31). The progression of knowledge over the 5 years of the course provided interesting information about the learning process. Although second year students completed the questionnaire after a term devoted to coursework in respiratory medicine, only 26% were able to name two preventive agents and 21% named three agents useful during acute attacks of asthma. Third year students gave correct responses in 39 and 45% of cases, respectively, and the correct response rates rose to 78 and 97% in the fifth year. This was probably because the theoretical knowledge needed to be acquired and tested against a clinical scenario before it could be used. The study demonstrated an increase in knowledge about asthma throughout the problem-based medical course. In addition to providing information about the educational process, it provided information about the questionnaire which was able to measure a range of knowledge and not just extremes of asthma knowledge.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Discipline strategies and parental perceptions of preschool children with asthma.Parents of 37 children with asthma (aged between three and five years) and of 37 healthy controls were interviewed about their involvement in everyday care, discipline practices, perceptions of their child and situations which were particularly stressful. There was little correlation between mothers' and fathers' preferences for different discipline practices. There was, however, greater agreement in their perceptions. Parents of children with asthma did not differ from those of healthy controls in discipline practices. However, children with asthma were perceived to be generally less healthy. Parents of those with asthma also reported a greater number of everyday situations to be stressful. These data do not support traditional assumptions that parents of children with asthma are more permissive or overindulgent. At least in this preschool sample, there was only limited indication of adverse effects of chronic disease on parenting practices.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Selenium status in relation to reduced glutathione peroxidase activity in aspirin-sensitive asthma.Selenium status and its relationship to lowered platelet glutathione peroxidase activity was investigated in 18 subjects with aspirin (ASA)-induced asthma and in asthmatic and non-asthmatic ASA-tolerant subjects. Mean serum selenium concentration in ASA-tolerant asthmatics (1.25 microns/l; 98.5 micrograms/l) was significantly higher than that in ASA-induced asthma subjects (1.14 microns/l; 89.7 micrograms/l) and than that in healthy controls (1.15 microns/l; 91 micrograms/l). Although there was a correlation between serum selenium concentration and platelet glutathione peroxidase activity, enzyme activity was significantly lower in the ASA-induced asthma group compared to other groups even after correcting for selenium status. These results indicate that lowered platelet glutathione peroxidase activity in ASA-induced asthma is a product of both selenium availability and an unidentified syndrome-specific (possibly genetic) factor.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Selective breeding of two lines of guinea pigs differing in bronchial sensitivity to acetylcholine and histamine exposure.We developed two lines of guinea pigs, one as model animals for bronchial asthma with bronchial hypersensitivity and the other with hyposensitivity as a control. In the last four years, the bronchial hypersensitive line (BHS) and hyposensitive line (BHR), both derived from Hartley strain guinea pigs, have been selected by using bronchial reactivity to acetylcholine and to histamine as parameters. Both lines have reached the F6 generation. The following results were obtained with the two lines: 1) Sib and cous in matings, and mating of selected consanguineous individuals were adopted in breeding BHS and BHR. The breeding started with six families, each, but in the F6 generation the number of families decreased to two in each line. 2) Appearance rates of hyper- or hyposensitivity to acetylcholine and histamine increased with successive generations in both lines, which had been completely separated by the F6 generation. 3) Coefficients of inbreeding in BHS and BHR in the F6 generation ranged from 42% to 45% in the former and 42% in the latter. 4) Heritabilities (h2) of BHS and BHR for the appearance rates of sensitivity to acetylcholine were presumed to be 0.54 in the former and 0.69 in the latter. 5) No difference in the body weight of 0, 20, and 40 day-old BHS was observed in any generation. On the other hand, the body weight of 20 and 40 day-old BHR tended to decrease with successive generations. 6) Mean litter sizes of BHS and BHR in each of the generations ranged from 2.24 to 3.47 animals in the former and from 2.63 to 3.38 animals in the latter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "ABSTRACT Influence of demographic and disease related factors on the degree of distress associated with symptoms and restrictions on daily living due to asthma in six countries.To investigate the influence of demographic and physiological variables on the degree of distress associated with asthma, 124 patients were recruited from six countries. All patients responded to 76 items relating to symptoms and impacts of asthma on daily living by marking a 10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS) to indicate the degree of distress associated with any particular item. The influence of three factors, age, sex and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), on these VAS scores was investigated. Differences between patients accounted for 13.4% of the total variance (sum of squares) in VAS scores. There were no significant effects of sex, age or FEV1 on VAS score (p greater than 0.05 in each case). The separate proportionate contribution of each of these three factors to the total variance in item scores ranged from 0.02% (FEV1) to 0.2% (sex). There were significant differences between the mean VAS scores from the six countries (p less than 0.01) but these differences contributed to only 3.6% of the total variance in the measured VAS scores. We conclude that demographic and disease related factors account for very little of the differences in the degree of distress that patients attach to the symptoms and effects of asthma. We suggest that it is possible to make meaningful comparisons between countries of the impact of asthma on patients' lives.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Bricanyl Turbuhaler in the treatment of asthma: a six week multi-centre study carried out in Sweden, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Norway and Finland.Two hundred and fifty eight adult patients with bronchial asthma participated in an open, parallel group study of 8 wks duration. During a 2 wk run-in period the beta 2-agonist terbutaline (0.5 mg q.i.d) was delivered via a pressurized freon aerosol, Bricanyl metered dose inhaler (MDI). During the following 6 wks, one third of the patients continued with MDI and two thirds with the same dose of terbutaline in the form of dry powder, Bricanyl Turbuhaler. There were no statistically significant differences in the increases in peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) after inhalation between the two treatment groups. The asthma symptom scores decreased in the Turbuhaler group during the study but remained the same in the MDI group. No difference in use of extra trial medication during the day was found. During the night, the difference was statistically significant in favour of Turbuhaler (p less than 0.05). Turbuhaler was well accepted and easy to use. As compared with the MDI used during run-in, 50% of the patients in the Turbuhaler group preferred to use Turbuhaler and 26% MDI, whilst 24% had no preference. In conclusion, Turbuhaler was at least as effective as MDI during the whole Turbuhaler life-span (6 wks).\n",

Yet asthma, like any disease, has a social as well as a medical dimension and it is increasingly being recognized that these two dimensions are interlinked. This paper describes a study into the social and personal impact of asthma on the lives of sufferers and their families. It shows that people are affected in many different ways: in employment, schooling, physical activities, social interaction, personal relationships and emotional well-being. All of the people interviewed had experienced some impact on their lives, albeit to varying degrees. The overall social impact was positively correlated with the severity of the asthma itself; this correlation was statistically significant in the case of adults and children under school age.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Asthma: a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.Asthma is a disease needing urgent action. Morbidity and mortality are rising, despite advances in our understanding of asthma and in its treatment. The lifetime prevalence of asthma in children varies from 5 to 31%, depending on the defining criteria, and even when recent prevalence (occurring in the past two years) is examined, rates from 5 to 18% have been found. There is growing evidence which shows that signs of reversible airways disease occur in the elderly with even greater frequency and it is likely that at least 10% of the population will need asthma treatment at some stage of their lives; this means that well over five million people in the UK or 250 patients in each 'average' general practice list of 2500 merit the diagnosis of asthma at some stage of their lives. The fact that an average practice is likely to have diagnosed less than half that number clearly implies that asthma is first and foremost an under-diagnosed disease.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The carotid bodies in bronchial asthma.A histological study was made of right-sided carotid bodies resected therapeutically from 50 patients with bronchial asthma. Also studied as controls were 10 right-sided carotid bodies from subjects coming to necropsy. Hypoxaemia was considered a contra-indication to glomectomy and only patients with a resting arterial oxygen tension exceeding 65 mm Hg were submitted to operation. It was found that in patients with a short history of bronchial asthma the carotid bodies were not enlarged, but there was hyperplasia of sustentacular cells. In cases with asthma for 5 years or more the sustentacular cell hyperplasia was more pronounced and was associated with many nerve fibrils and slight enlargement of the carotid bodies. The functional significance of the proliferation of sustentacular cells and the abundance of nerve axons is obscure. In the asthma cases there was prominence of the dark variant of chief cells, thought to be related to episodes of hypoxaemia.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Occupational asthma.Occupational asthma is becoming an increasingly common problem worldwide. To date however, the impact of this disorder in Ireland has not been evaluated. In this present study we document 39 cases of occupational asthma presenting to St. Vincent's Hospital between 1978 and 1988 and evaluate the patient characteristics, the occupationals involved, the causative agents and clinical course and outcome. The characteristics of the occupational asthma group were striking when compared to traditional occupational lung diseases, such as the pneumoconioses. These features were (i) the relatively young age--30 patients (77%) developed their disease by the age of 35, (ii) the presence of a substantial group of women--31% of the study group, and (iii) the relatively rapid onset of asthma after taking up employment--56% had asthma within three years of exposure. In contrast the pneumoconioses affect older, preponderantly male workers who manifest clinically symptomatic disease after decades of exposure. Long standing traditional industries were well represented ranging from milling and the bakery trade to textiles and printing. However, there was an even larger contribution from the more modern, high technology sector particularily the chemical, electronic and plastic industries.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Effective site of bronchodilation by antiasthma drugs in subjects with asthma.We studied the effective sites of airway response to atropine and fenoterol aerosols and to the intravenous injection of aminophylline in patients with stable and spontaneous asthma, by the simultaneous assessment of respiratory resistance (Rrs) and anatomic dead space (VD). Central airway response was determined by VD, and overall response was determined by Rrs. Peripheral airway response was inferred from Rrs when the change in VD was slight. Atropine (4 mg/ml) or fenoterol (0.4 mg/ml) was continuously inhaled during tidal breathing for 5 minutes. Inhalation of both atropine and fenoterol increased Grs (reciprocal of Rrs) (p less than 0.01) with a simultaneous increase in VD (p less than 0.01) in the patients with stable and spontaneous asthma. Fenoterol increased Grs more than did atropine at an equivalent increase in VD in patients with spontaneous asthma (p less than 0.05). Intravenous injection of aminophylline (250 mg) had no effect on either Grs or VD in patients with stable asthma, but it significantly increased Grs (p less than 0.01) without change in VD in patients with spontaneous asthma. These results suggest that the predominant sites of bronchodilation induced by inhaled atropine are the central airways, that those sites induced by intravenous injection of aminophylline are the peripheral airways, and that inhaled fenoterol dilates both the central and peripheral airways in subjects with asthma. Differences among clinically used bronchodilators on the effective sites may be considered in the treatment of bronchial asthma.\n",

Subjects with asthma between the ages of 6 and 59 years presenting for acute ER care for asthma were systematically assigned by alternating, consecutively, the day of their ER visit to receive either (1) facilitated referral to an asthma specialist within the allergy department and concomitant comprehensive ongoing asthma care (intervention group, n = 149) or (2) continued outpatient management from generalist physicians (control group, n = 160). The course of their asthma was evaluated blindly during the subsequent 6 months by review of medical records, initial and follow-up questionnaires, and spirometry. Compared to the control group, the intervention group noted (1) a 75% reduction in the number of, and percent of, subjects with asthma awakenings per night (p less than or equal to 0.0001), (2) an almost 50% reduction in asthma ER relapses (p = 0.017) resulting from a reduction in the frequency of multiple relapse (p = 0.005), and (3) a greater use of inhaled corticosteroids (p less than 0.00001) and cromolyn (p = 0.002). Thus, facilitated referral of subjects with asthma to specialists in asthma therapy after acute ER therapy appears to reduce asthma ER relapses and to improve asthma outcome.\n",

      "ABSTRACT IgG subclasses in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with asthma.We have measured Immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclasses in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from 12 non-smoking patients with stable asthma and 9 non-smoking healthy volunteers to obtain information on their possible role in local immunological reactions. The quotients (concentration of IgG subclass in BALF)/(concentration of IgG subclass in serum) were calculated. In controls QIgG3 were lower than QIgG1, QIgG2 and QIgG4. The IgG subclasses in BALF and epithelial lining fluid (ELF) from patients with asthma were significantly higher than in controls, mainly due to increased leakage from the blood. Again QIgG3 were lower than Q of other subclasses. In the analysis of local production of IgG, albumin or ceruloplasmin was used as reference protein. Several patients showed a local production or a preferential accumulation of one or more IgG subclasses. We conclude that in healthy persons the IgG subclasses in ELF originate from the systemic circulation by passive permeation. In patients with asthma, the permeability of the respiratory membrane may be increased resulting in increased concentrations of subclasses in lung-lining fluid. In some patients with asthma, an additional local production of IgG subclasses occurs.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [The effect of halothane, enflurane and isoflurane on resistance and compliance in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive lung diseases].In order to test the hypothesis that halothane is more effective and safer than enflurane and isoflurane in patients with reactive airway disease, a clinical trial was performed to compare these three agents in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS. After obtaining institutional approval and informed consent, 31 patients with bronchial asthma or COPD were studied (FEV1 less than 65% of FVC); all patients underwent extensive surgery of the paranasal sinuses. Premedication consisted of i.m. atropine and promethazine; anesthesia was induced with diazepam, fentanyl, etomidate, and succinylcholine and maintained with pancuronium and 50% N2O in O2 together with one of the volatile agents, halothane, enflurane, or isoflurane, selected at random. Patients were mechanically ventilated. On the basis of respiratory pressures, volumes, and flows, inspiratory (Rin) and expiratory (Rex) resistance and compliance (C) were calculated after induction (control), 15 min after the addition of the volatile agent (1.25 MAC), every 15 min during the surgical procedure, and at the end of the operation. RESULTS. In 1 case, airway resistance increased markedly a few minutes after administration of isoflurane. The results obtained in this patient were not included in the evaluation of the data. There were no statistically significant differences in the preoperative data or control values of Rin, Rex, and C among the three groups (n = 10 each). With the respective inhalational agents, Rin increased maximally between 3% (halothane) or 8% (enflurane) and 21% (isoflurane), Rex between 16% (halothane, enflurane) and 29% (isoflurane). For the most part, however, these changes were not statistically significant as compared with controls. Intergroup comparisons failed to reveal any statistically significant differences either. In all groups C decreased continuously to about 90% of control. DISCUSSION. The results show that in patients with asthma or COPD, airway resistance remains virtually unchanged during surgery and anesthesia under halothane or enflurane anesthesia. With isoflurane, however, the resistance may rise by a slight but not statistically significant extent. Furthermore, marked bronchospastic reactions occurred in 2 patients in the isoflurane group. Thus, the three volatile anesthetics studied were not found to be unequivocally safe and effective in preventing increases in bronchomotor tone. However, pharmacodynamic effects other than those on respiration (e.g., cardiovascular actions, arrhythmogenic threshold, metabolism, toxicity) must additionally be taken into consideration.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Time course of change in bronchial reactivity with an inhaled corticosteroid in asthma.The time course of change in FEV1, bronchial reactivity, and daily measures of asthma control (peak expiratory flow, symptoms, and beta 2-agonist inhaler use) was determined during 6 wk of treatment with inhaled budesonide, 800 micrograms twice a day, and for 2 wk following cessation of treatment in 40 asthmatic subjects in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study. Histamine reactivity, expressed as the provocative dose of histamine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PD20), was measured at intervals during the 8 wk of the study, with more frequent measurements after the first and last dose of drug to provide a detailed profile of change at the start and end of treatment. The first dose of budesonide caused a small increase in median values of FEV1 (0.2 L) and PD20 (1.0 doubling dose of histamine), which was maximum at 6 h. There was a further increase in FEV1 and PD20 over the 6 wk in the budesonide group relative to placebo, the maximum increases (0.53 L, 3.4 doubling doses of histamine) being recorded 6 h after the last dose on Day 42. Following cessation of treatment, FEV1 and PD20 declined and PD20 returned to placebo values at 1 wk. Median PEF increased by 40 and 30 L/min in the morning and evening, respectively, with budesonide treatment. Symptom scores and beta 2-agonist inhaler use were lower in the budesonide group than the placebo group during treatment but tended to be similar (symptom scores) or higher (beta 2-agonist) in the 2 wk following cessation of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "ABSTRACT Control of airway caliber by autonomic nerves in asthma and in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Autonomic nerves can influence airway caliber via their effects on airway smooth muscle, bronchial vessels, and mucous glands and may therefore contribute to airway narrowing in asthma or in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Human lungs receive cholinergic, noradrenergic, and peptidergic efferents and several types of afferents. Cholinergic nerve activity contributes to airway narrowing both in asthma and in COPD. Reflex vagal activity may be enhanced because of epithelial damage and exposition of sensory nerve endings to nonspecific irritants. Other possible mechanisms include defects in prejunctional receptors that inhibit acetylcholine release, several postjunctional factors that nonspecifically enhance the effect of a given degree of cholinergic muscle contraction on airway caliber, and interactions between inflammatory mediators and the cholinergic system. The main direct bronchodilating nerve activity in human lungs is nonadrenergic, and scanty data suggest that nonadrenergic inhibitory nerve activity may be variably reduced in asthmatics. Human airway muscle virtually lacks adrenergic innervation, but adrenergic nerves may influence airway caliber by acting on bronchial vessels, mucous glands, and parasympathetic nerves and ganglia. The response of asthmatic airways to beta-agonists seems intrinsically normal, but it may be reduced during severe asthma attacks. There are no convincing data that abnormal adrenergic control is present in the airways of patients with COPD. The physiologic relevance of excitatory neuropeptides in sensory nerves in human airways is uncertain. Tachykinins have proinflammatory and spasmogenic properties and are therefore of potential interest as a factor in the pathogenesis of obstructive airway disease. In conclusion, the data presently available support an abnormal autonomic control of the airways in asthma but not in COPD.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Sensory neuropeptide involvement in animal models of airway irritation and of allergen-evoked asthma.C-fiber afferents in the airways are in close contact with mast cells and are activated both upon allergic reactions and by inhalation of irritants such as capsaicin and cigarette smoke. This evokes both protective reflexes such as cough as well as local release of tachykinins and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) with subsequent actions on blood vessels (vasodilatation and plasma protein extravasation) and bronchial smooth muscle (bronchoconstriction). After capsaicin pretreatment when peptides have been depleted from the sensory nerves, there is a marked reduction of the vasodilatatory response upon allergen challenge and the protein extravasation evoked by cigarette smoke. Conversely, chronic cigarette smoke exposure is accompanied by increased coughing to capsaicin challenge. Furthermore, aerosol immunization and chronic smoke exposure are both associated with elevated tissue levels of CGRP, suggesting upregulation of C-fiber function and peptide synthesis, which may contribute to airway hyperreactivity.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Characteristics of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and in asthma.By studying the characteristics of BHR in subjects clearly defined as having asthma or COPD, it is apparent that there are both similarities and differences. These responses can be broadly explained in terms of present knowledge of the pathologic features and the mechanisms causing the abnormalities in the two diseases, and they highlight the important differences between the diseases. It seems likely that tests of BHR with histamine and methacholine cannot be used to distinguish asthma from COPD in subjects with a mild decrease in FEV1 and symptoms that do not clearly suggest asthma or COPD. However, a dose-response curve to methacholine is helpful. If there is a plateau, and the PD20 FEV1 is more than 4.0 mumol, it is unlikely to be asthma. If there is no plateau, a test with propranolol or SO2 may be useful to discriminate the two diseases. The similarities in the responses-especially those to histamine-explain why there is frequently difficulty in deciding the nature of the disease present in an individual subject. Is it important to distinguish the two diseases? In the introduction it was suggested that it is important for understanding these diseases, for prognosis, for treatment, and ultimately for prevention. It remains difficult to determine prognosis from any single test of bronchial responsiveness, and response to prophylaxis (stopping smoking, allergen avoidance) plus drug treatment over several years is probably needed to predict outcome in an individual patient. Finally, despite the valid hypothesis proposed by Orie and coworkers (2), it seems unlikely that studying the characteristics of BHR will shed light on the \"host\" factors present in both diseases that remain poorly understood.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Interaction between parenchyma and airways in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and in asthma.The extent of air-space destruction caused by emphysema is very variable in severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), constituting one of the most obvious differences between COPD and asthma. Differences in the static deflation pressure-volume curve between COPD and asthma can easily be shown, but it has been surprisingly difficult to find distinctive mechanical features of impaired airway function caused by air-space destruction. This may be because in mild airway obstruction related to smoking--particularly in younger subjects--emphysema may be absent, and the predominant site of airway narrowing in the smallest bronchi and respiratory bronchioles may be the same as that found in asthma in remission. In more severe obstruction caused by COPD there is almost always very severe intrinsic disease of the airways and this may so dominate the functional abnormality that it is difficult to detect any additional change because of airspace destruction. Overall, few studies have set out to detect specific effects of parenchymal destruction on airway function.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Is it useful to distinguish between asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in respiratory epidemiology.Disagreement exists on how to define asthma in population studies. Features characteristic of asthma also have been demonstrated in nonasthmatic subjects. For example, although in a random sample of 339 subjects investigated in the Netherlands, subjects with a history of asthmatic attacks, wheeze and/or dyspnea, or chronic dry cough on average were the most responsive (mean PD20 values for histamine of 11.5, 17.0, and 15.0 mg/ml) and asymptomatic subjects were the least responsive (mean PD20, 45.4 mg/ml), the distributions of PD20 values in all groups overlapped considerably. The best way to investigate the association between exposure and disease is in a cohort study. It is argued that follow-up studies in patients may have limited meaning because of a high risk for selection bias. Furthermore, in general, diagnostic disease entities will not represent homogeneous exposure groups. It is concluded that end points of disease should be defined as objectively as possible, for instance, as the level of FEV1, or as simple respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea, wheeze, or chronic cough. Terms such as \"asthma,\" \"COPD,\" or \"CNSLD\" will not be helpful in defining end points because there is a risk that they could introduce bias, misclassification, and hence confusion.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Hyperresponsiveness as a determinant of the outcome in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.A better outcome of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) appears to be determined by higher FEV1, smoking cessation, lower airway hyperresponsiveness, and, at least in the presence of therapy, with a higher reversibility of airflow obstruction. In our opinion, these findings provide a firm ground for smoking cessation and most likely for institution of early treatment directed at both the reversible part of airflow obstruction and airway hyperresponsiveness in patients with COPD. But there are large gaps in our understanding of the effects of bronchodilator and antiinflammatory drugs on airway hyperresponsiveness. After acute administration, sympathomimetics cause a larger reduction of airway hyperresponsiveness than do anticholinergics, both in asthma and in COPD. What happens after longer periods of treatment is not yet clear in COPD, whereas in asthma there may occur a deterioration of airway responsiveness. Corticosteroids appear to have a beneficial effect on lung function and the severity of airway hyperresponsiveness in asthma. In COPD, however, no definite conclusion can be drawn as to the beneficial effect of corticosteroids, but short-term effects are not promising. The available data from the literature strongly suggest the need for long-term studies with large groups of patients in order to assess a potential treatment effect. In this way, also, a subgroup of patients with COPD who improve with corticosteroids and/or bronchodilators may be found. It seems advisable to include both subjective (i.e., quality of life, complaints, symptoms) and objective (i.e., hospitalization, survival, FEV1, PEFR, PC20, and reversibility) data as investigational tools for outcome analysis.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Clinical ventilatory functions and immunological studies in bronchial asthma.Clinical characteristics, ventilatory functions and serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM and IgA) were assessed in 30 asthmatic patients. Sixty per cent patients belonged to early onset group ie, had onset of disease before 30 years of age. Seasonal asthmatics formed the largest group (56.6%) followed by perennial (26.6%) and irregular (16.6%) type. On the basis of ventilatory function tests, maximum number of cases (15) had asthma of moderate severity, followed by mild (12 patients) and severe forms (3 patients). Mean serum levels (mg%) of IgG (1631.93 +/- 270.71) and IgM (233.82 +/- 86.93) were significantly elevated in asthmatics as compared to controls. Higher serum IgA levels were observed in bronchial asthma patients (257.58 +/- 81.06) as compared to controls (225.69 +/- 49.75), but this rise was not statistically significant. Duration, periodicity of asthmatic attacks and the severity had no influence on the levels of the above three mentioned immunoglobulins, but it was observed that patients who had associated other allergies and positive family history of atopic disorders exhibited higher serum IgA and IgM levels, compared to those who had no such history. This difference was however not seen in serum IgG levels.\n",

A specific question was whether or not serum ECP changes with a circadian rhythm. Eighty nine children with bronchial asthma and sixteen normal, non-atopic subjects were studied. Serum ECP, eosinophil counts (Eo) and pulmonary functions were measured 4 or 5 times a day. ECP was quantitated by a specific radioimmunoassay. Serum ECP and Eo were significantly higher in the patients with bronchial asthma than in non-atopic subjects. Serum ECP levels were higher during asthma attacks and at 24 hours after attacks than those in stable conditions (free of attacks for more than 7 days). Although no circadian rhythm was observed in ECP changes, the patients with bronchial asthma showed a significantly greater variation of serum ECP levels than the non-atopic subjects. There was no significant correlation between serum ECP levels and 2- or 8-week attack score before the ECP measurement. These results suggest that serum ECP increases in bronchial asthma, especially in its acute exacerbation phase, and may reflect eosinophil activation in vivo.\n",

The training was performed by bicycle ergometer for four weeks every day at 125% of WBPLA1 (work load at first breaking point of lactic acid). The results obtained were as follows. 1. Heart rate decreased from 188.5 +/- 9.6 bpm before to 178.4 +/- 9.7 bpm after training at 150% of WBPLA1 (p less than 0.05). After training at 175% of WBPLA1 it decreased also from 174.0 +/- 11.9 bpm to 165.6 +/- 11.3 bpm. Maximum oxygen consumption increased from 34.5 +/- 3.5 ml/min/kg to 41.4 +/- 4.0 ml/min/kg after training (p less than 0.001). 2. Max. % fall in FEV1.0 decreased from 27.1 +/- 24.0% before to 18.0 +/- 17.1% after training at 150% of WBPLA1 (p less than 0.05).

      "ABSTRACT Channeling bias in the interpretation of drug effects.Channeling is a form of allocation bias, where drugs with similar therapeutic indications are prescribed to groups of patients with prognostic differences. Claimed advantages of a new drug may channel it to patients with special pre-existing morbidity, with the consequence that disease states can be incorrectly attributed to use of the drug. For the study of adverse drug reactions, large databases supply information on co-medication and morbidity of patients. For diseases with a stepped-care approach, the drug history of patients, as available from some databases, can show channeling of drugs to patients with markers of relatively severe disease.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Clinical and epidemiologic aspects of ecologically induced bronchial asthma].After prosthetics of the aortal valve 30 patients underwent bicycle ergometry training at the sanatorial stage of rehabilitation. 10 patients who did not undergo bicycle ergometry training made up the control group. The efficacy of bicycle ergometry training was assessed according to the time-course of changes in pump and contractile functions of the heart and oxygen consumption at rest and during bicycle ergometry. Transfer of the patients to a higher functional class, a decrease in the number of threshold reactions, attainment of a higher heart rate and a higher oxygen consumption, capacity for an increase of the stroke index up to the load of 1.0 W/kg and of the level of the myocardial reserve up to 1.5-2.0 W/kg were used as criteria for the effectiveness of bicycle ergometry training. The effectiveness of bicycle ergometry training is also supported by the data obtained on comparison of the findings in the main and control groups.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Asthma, allergic rhinitis and atopic eczema in Finnish children and adolescents.The parents of 3649 Finnish children and adolescents were interviewed in 1980 to evaluate the prevalence of bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis. The same group was interviewed 6 years later to determine the incidence of new cases of bronchial asthma in the 1980s. Age- and sex-matched samples were taken from three areas, southern, eastern and northern Finland to allow assessment of possible regional differences in prevalences and incidences. The prevalences of atopic eczema, allergic rhinitis and asthma were 1.7%, 6.0% and 4.3%, respectively. These figures are similar to those found in previous studies in Scandinavia and Finland over 10 years ago. The prevalence of atopy was highest (6.4%) in southern Finland, which is the most urbanized area of our country. The prevalence of asthma was highest (3.3%) in northern Finland. This is still low when compared with the incidences in other European countries. THe prevalences of asthma and atopy were lowest in eastern Finland which is the most agrarian area. The incidence of asthma was 1.5 cases/1000 individuals/year, but regional differences were shown.\n",

The reaction equilibrium was reached after 9 and 18 h. respectively, in the first and the second step of the test. A marked correlation with the degree of ligand substitution was observed, the highest sensitivity being achieved with the lowest (2.9) MDI/HSA molar ratio examined. Higher (up to 50) degrees of substitution resulted in progressively lower levels of radioactivity bound and in a loss of specificity, as confirmed by RAST inhibition experiments. At high levels of ligand substitution, high titers of total serum IgE affected RAST results.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Acute asthma. Admission chest radiography in hospitalized adult patients.The utility of admission chest radiography has been controversial in the management of adult patients admitted to the hospital with acute asthma. We reviewed the impact of admission chest radiography on in-hospital management of 54 adult patients with acute asthma. Each patient was admitted after a failed 12-h course of bronchodilator therapy in the emergency ward. Major radiographic abnormalities were found in 20 (34 percent) of 58 occasions. These abnormalities included focal parenchymal opacities, IIM, enlarged cardiac silhouette, pulmonary vascular congestion, new solitary pulmonary nodule and pneumothorax. Subsequent antibiotic use correlated with radiographic focal opacities or IIM, even in afebrile patients, but did not correlate with elevated blood leukocyte count. Based on the evidence of in-hospital alteration of management independent of elevated blood leukocyte count and body temperature, we recommend that chest radiographs be obtained for all adult patients admitted because of acute asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Inhaled verapamil-induced bronchoconstriction in mild asthma.Methacholine challenges were performed in ten subjects with mild asthma at 2 h before and 20 min after placebo or 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 mg of inhaled verapamil given in a single-blind randomized crossover manner on different days. While verapamil did not have a bronchodilator effect, the 10-mg dose modestly increased the concentration of methacholine required to decrease FEV1 by 20 percent (PC20). The mean (+/- SEM) increase in PC20 from baseline was 2.1 +/- 0.2 times baseline after 10 mg of verapamil, compared to 1.1 +/- 0.1 times baseline after placebo (p less than 0.001). Unexpectedly, bronchoconstriction (greater than 10 percent decrease in FEV1) associated with cough or wheezing was observed in seven of ten subjects at doses of 20 mg or more. This adverse effect was not related to the osmolarity of the nebulized solutions. Thirty minutes before a standardized exercise challenge, 13 subjects inhaled placebo, 10 mg, or the highest dose of verapamil tolerated during the methacholine study (20 to 160 mg) in a double-blind randomized crossover manner. The exercise challenge was aborted in three subjects because of bronchospasm that occurred after administration of the higher dose. The mean (+/- SEM) maximum change in FEV1 after exercise in the ten subjects completing all three regimens of treatment was -17.1 +/- 4.0 percent after placebo, -12.7 +/- 4.3 percent after 10 mg (p less than 0.05), and -6.4 +/- 3.6 percent after the highest dose (p less than 0.05). We conclude that increasing the dose of verapamil above 10 mg did not provide greater benefit but, paradoxically, induced bronchoconstriction in most of the subjects. Because of this potential bronchoconstrictor effect, high doses of oral or intravenous verapamil should be used with caution in asthmatic subjects.\n",

The prevalence of OA was 36 percent. Peak flows were interpreted by two observers blinded to other results. Criteria for a PEFR interpretation of OA were as follow: diurnal variation greater than or equal to 20 percent relatively more frequently or with greater variation on working days than days off work. With the objective diagnoses as the gold standard, the sensitivity of the PEFR interpretations was 72 percent for OA; specificity for no asthma was 53 percent. Excluding those with greater than or equal to 20 percent variation on only one day sensitivity improved to 93 percent for OA, and specificity to 77 percent. There was an acceptable level of interobserver variation (kappa 62 to 83 percent).

Cases of asthma were ascertained by record-linkage from three sources of data: death certificates from the Central Statistical Office; hospital discharges from the nationwide hospital registry; and the nationwide registry for fully reimbursed medications of the Social Insurance Institution. A diagnosis of bronchial asthma in one or more of these registers was obtained for 525 (236 men and 289 women) out of 27,776 twin individuals. Among MZ pairs, ten concordant and 138 discordant pairs were identified, while among DZ pairs, 12 concordant and 343 discordant pairs were found. In the whole sample the observed-expected ratio for the number of pairs concordant for bronchial asthma was 4.30 (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 2.06 to 7.90) in MZ pairs and 2.61 (95 percent CI, 1.35 to 4.56) in DZ pairs. Using a multifactorial threshold model, we estimated the correlation in liability to asthma as 0.425 (SE = 0.07) in MZ twins and 0.247 (SE = 0.06) in DZ twins, and we obtained a heritability estimate of 35.6 percent. The data also showed a gender difference in asthma heredity, which may, however, be due to chance events affecting the distribution of concordant pairs.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The perceptions of Canadian young adults with asthma of their health teaching/learning needs.Nurses maintain that they can assist individuals with chronic illness to cope with their health problems experienced in daily living through health (patient) teaching. However, several authors claim that in planning health teaching, nurses tend to rely on their perceptions of the learning needs of persons, as opposed to drawing upon the individual's understanding of their needs. Few research studies have investigated the health teaching needs of persons with chronic illness from their unique point of view. This study examined the perceived learning needs to manage the associated health problems of young adults with asthma. The University of British Columbia Model for Nursing provided an innovative and holistic means to attain perceptions in the health teaching assessment process and facilitated the development of a learning needs assessment tool. Survey methodology was used. A convenience sample of 40 young adults between the ages of 20 and 45 years was interviewed. Twenty of the sample resided in British Columbia, Canada, and 20 in Ontario, Canada. Implications of findings are discussed with regard to nursing practice.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Esophageal chest pain in children with asthma.Sixteen patients with asthma and chest pain of greater than 2 months duration underwent gastroenterological evaluation utilizing fiber-optic esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), esophageal manometry, and Bernstein testing. Eleven of 16 patients (75%) had endoscopic and histologic evidence of esophagitis. One patient with esophagitis exhibited high-amplitude peristaltic contractions during motility testing. Four of these 11 patients (36%) had a positive Bernstein test. Extended intraesophageal pH monitoring of seven patients with esophagitis revealed significant gastroesophageal reflux (GER) in all of these patients. Chest pain was associated with an episode of GER in three patients (43%). Nine of 11 patients (82%) with esophagitis responded to medical therapy, resulting in resolution of esophageal inflammation and chest pain. One patient required Nissen fundoplication surgery after failure of medical therapy, and one patient who refused surgery progressively developed more severe esophagitis during 9 months of medical therapy. Children with asthma may have chest pain due to gastroesophageal reflux-associated esophagitis that usually responds to medical therapy.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Effect of 0.25 ppm nitrogen dioxide on the airway response to methacholine in asymptomatic asthmatic patients.In asthmatic patients, short-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide at low concentrations has been reported to result in a nonuniform airway response to various bronchoconstrictive stimuli. We therefore investigated in 11 patients with mild and stable asthma with normal baseline airway tone the effect of 0.25 ppm nitrogen dioxide on the airway response to methacholine. On 2 separate days, the subjects inhaled either 0.25 ppm nitrogen dioxide or filtered air (sham) during 20 min of tidal breathing followed by 10 min of bicycle exercise at room temperature (mean exercise ventilation 30 L/min). Methacholine inhalation tests were performed 1 h after the end of exercise to determine the methacholine concentration necessary to increase SRaw by 100% (PC100SRaw). On a third day, a methacholine challenge was done without previous exposure (control). Mean (SEM) exercise-induced increase of SRaw was 80 (24) % after sham and 82 (25) % after nitrogen dioxide, which was not significantly different (p greater than 0.10). PC100SRaw did not differ on the 3 occasions, geometric mean values (variability of mean) being 0.41 (1.6). 0.41 (1.6), and 0.46 (1.5) mg/ml after sham, nitrogen dioxide, and control, respectively (p less than 0.10). We therefore conclude that in patients with mild and stable asthma short-term exposure to 0.25 ppm nitrogen dioxide during rest and exercise does not increase methacholine responsiveness 1 h after exposure.\n",

Sixteen patients with drug-induced disease were placed under the author's observation. Of these, 8 patients fell ill due to penicillin, 3 to tetracycline, 3 to sulfanilamide intake and alpha to intal inhalations. In 10 patients, pneumonia was characterized by high blood eosinophilia (from 20 to 53%, 37.5 +/- 2.7%) and in 6, it was of moderate nature (from 10 to 15%, 11.8 +/- 0.8%). According to the author's data, the immunopathological response coupled with suppression of the T lymphocyte system, inhibition of the enzymatic activity of leukocytes, dysproteinemias with hypergammaglobulinemia, reductions of the concentration of IgG underlie the disease pathogenesis. In the patients with high blood eosinophilia, including 4 with polysystemic lesions, the disease ran a grave course. The therapeutic effect could only be attained owing to the monotherapy with prednisolone. In the long-term period, 9 patients developed glucocorticoid-dependent bronchial asthma.

Both children had been treated since infancy with pulsed steroidal inhalers, short courses of oral or parenteral steroids, and steroidal skin preparations (for associated eczema). Adrenocortical atrophy has not been described previously in this clinical context. The increasing administration of steroids to asthmatic children may lead to the production of overt--or more frequently, subclinical--atrophy of the adrenal cortices with important consequences to mortality and morbidity.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Acute exacerbation of bronchial asthma in children associated with afternoon weather changes.We studied the effect of the weather on acute exacerbations of bronchial asthma in children by comparing records of 8,657 admissions for five acute respiratory diseases (3,064 for asthma) with concurrent meteorologic data. These diseases were classified according to their interrelations and distinct meteorologic patterns into two groups: (1) acute asthma and acute laryngitis, which are correlated with the afternoon gradients of air temperature, heat content (the thermal energy of the ambient air), and modified heat content factor (the energy required to heat the air water vapor to the ambient temperature), but not correlated with the absolute values of air temperature and water content: and (2), bronchopneumonia/pneumonia and upper respiratory infections, which are correlated only with the absolute values of the meteorologic parameters (air temperature, water content, heat content, and modified heat content factor), but not with their afternoon gradients. Admissions for bronchiolitis revealed an age-related pattern: up to 1 yr they resembled Group 2 and from 1 to 2 yr, Group 1. It follows that the admission rates of acute exacerbation of bronchial asthma in childhood are linked both to the afternoon weather gradients and to some of the acute respiratory infections.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Nonspecific bronchial reactivity in asthmatic children depends on severity but not on age.Bronchial reactivity to inhaled methacholine was measured by the steady-state tidal breathing method in asthmatic children aged 1 to 17 yr. The children were divided into three clinical groups according to their minimal therapeutic requirements: mild asthma, children requiring infrequent treatment with inhaled beta-agonists (81 patients); moderate asthma, children requiring daily preventive treatment with either cromolyn sodium or slow-release theophylline (67 patients); and severe asthma, children requiring daily preventive treatment with oral or inhaled steroids (34 patients). They were also divided into three age groups: from 1 to 6 yr, tested by using bronchial provocation with tracheal auscultation (BPTA) to determine the methacholine concentration causing wheezing (PCW); and from 7 to 11 yr and 12 to 17 yr, using lung function testing to determine the concentration causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20). For the whole group the mean level of bronchial reactivity to methacholine correlated inversely with the severity of bronchial asthma according to the minimal drug requirements (p less than 0.0001) and was similar over the whole age range (p less than 0.9965) for each severity grouping. In the older children the difference between moderate and severe asthma was not significant, but this may have been a result of the effect of corticosteroids in the severe group. We concluded that age has no significant effect on the methacholine response in asthmatic children over a wide age range.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Measurement of breathlessness during exercise in asthmatics. Predictor variables, reliability, and responsiveness.The purpose of this study was to determine the predictor variables for breathlessness and to investigate the criteria of reliability and responsiveness for measuring breathlessness during progressive, incremental exercise on the cycle ergometer. We studied a heterogeneous group of patients with stable asthma (mean +/- SEM age, 46 +/- 4 yr) for four visits at weekly intervals. Predictor variables were determined at the first visit. Nine independent physiologic variables were obtained at each minute during exercise; the Borg rating of breathlessness (range 0 to 10) was used as the dependent variable. The regression model relating the physiologic parameters to the Borg rating of breathlessness was highly significant (model F = 43.4; p = 0.0001). Backward elimination selected the strongest predictors of the Borg rating: peak inspiratory flow (VI); tidal volume (VT)/FVC; frequency of respiration (f); and peak inspiratory mouth pressures (Pm). These four variables explained 63% of the variance in the rating of dyspnea. Each of the four variables exhibited a linear relationship with the Borg rating. Test-retest reliability was assessed by comparing results at the first and second visits. Individual slopes (except for VT/FVC) and intercepts for the four predictor variables versus Borg ratings were highly reliable. The slope for work intensity (watts) and Borg ratings, but not the intercept, was highly reliable. Responsiveness was evaluated by randomly administering inhaled methacholine or inhaled metaproterenol, alternately, at the third and fourth visits to induce acute changes in lung function before exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "ABSTRACT Effect of cold air on the bronchial response to inhaled histamine in patients with asthma.We measured the concentration of inhaled histamine required to reduce the FEV1 by 20% (PC20) in seven asthmatic patients immediately following the inhalation of warm air (mean temperature +/- 1 SD, 21.1 +/- 1.1 degrees C) and following cold air inhalation (-10.2 +/- 5.0 degrees C). Patients breathed either warm or cold air for 10 min before 30-s challenges with doubling concentrations of aerosolized histamine that were nebulized while the subject breathed warm air. Before histamine inhalation minute ventilation (VI) was 8.41 +/- 1.38 L/min breathing warm air and 7.86 +/- 0.97 L/min breathing cold air. Respiratory heat exchange (RHE) was 0.25 +/- 0.05 kcal/min with warm air and 0.24 +/- 0.03 kcal/min with cold air. The PC20 obtained following cold air breathing (0.48 +/- 4.63 mg/ml) was lower than that following warm air breathing (0.85 +/- 4.60 mg/ml; p less than 0.02). We conclude that breathing cold air increases the bronchial reactivity to inhaled histamine in asthmatic patients.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Immediate and late inflammatory responses to ragweed antigen challenge of the peripheral airways in allergic asthmatics. Cellular, mediator, and permeability changes.Asthma may represent the clinical manifestations of a unique form of chronic airway inflammation and is often associated with allergy. To better define the components of allergic inflammation in the lung, fluids obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were examined for cells, inflammatory mediators, and markers of airway permeability 5 min and 19 h following instillation of ragweed antigen directly into an airway segment of allergic asthmatic subjects. The 5-min response to antigen challenge (n = 10) was characterized by 17- to 208-fold increases in histamine, prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), and its metabolite, 9 alpha,11 beta-PGF2, thromboxane B2, and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha compared with a saline-challenged segment (0.004 less than p less than 0.017). The increases in most of these mediators were significantly correlated with each other (0.0001 less than p less than or equal to 0.01), and the magnitude of all significant mediator increases was directly correlated with skin test sensitivity to ragweed antigen (0.007 less than or equal to p less than or equal to 0.05). There was also a slight increase in kinins (p = 0.04). Changes in cells and airway permeability were not detected. In contrast, the 19-h response to antigen challenge (n = 9) was characterized by a 13-fold increase in total cells recovered by BAL. Eosinophils, basophils, and lymphocytes were significantly increased and comprised 38, 1, and 9% of total cells, respectively. A neutrophil influx was also observed but was not specific for antigen challenge since a similar change was observed in a sham, saline-challenged site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

Asthmatics and patients with allergic rhinitis had significantly higher BAL histamine than did normal subjects (169 +/- 22, 141 +/- 23, 42 +/- 6 pg/ml, respectively; p less than 0.05, both comparisons).

Baseline VA/Q distributions were unimodal and relatively narrow in 12 patients and modestly bimodal in the other four. The dispersion of pulmonary blood flow (log SD Q) was slightly enlarged (0.71 +/- 0.09) and that of ventilation (log SD V) was normal (0.57 +/- 0.04) (normal range, 0.3 to 0.6); an index of overall VA/Q heterogeneity (DISP R-E*) was also mildly abnormal (5.3 +/- 0.8) (normal values less than 3.0).

Seven groups of healthy females and patients were measured to explore differential effects on compact and trabecular bone. In healthy females CBD remains constant within 0.2% from age 20 to 70. TBD measured in the same individuals is reduced by 50%. The scatter of the individual CBD values is 1.5% only, that of TBD 20%. Longitudinal examinations of corticosteroid treated asthmatics during one year showed a loss of TBD of 4.8%. During the same period CBD remained completely stable. In other diseases such as hyperparathyroidism CBD is reduced as well. This study showed the feasibility of a noninvasive determination of the density of compact bone and demonstrated that density loss of compact and trabecular bone is considerably different.\n",

The following situations were observed: The parents of asthmatic children showed a higher level of anxiety towards the health of the children in comparison with parents in control group (p less than 0.01). The coping modes of Israeli born parents scored higher than parents born in North Africa or Asia. Parents from other countries scored the lowest of the three (p = 0.004). The behavior pattern of parents of children with mild asthma was more controlled than parents of children with severe asthma (p less than 0.05). Chronic and prolonged asthma cause a decrease in communication between the parents and child (P less than 0.05). The number of children in the family has a direct effect upon the degree of the parent's anxiety towards the child's health. Parents who have 1-2 children, one of which is asthmatic, were found to be more anxious than parents with 3-4 children. The above mentioned data influence the parental behavior, which was better when the first or second child was asthmatic than if he was the third or fourth child in the family. Coping with chronic disease of the asthmatic child should include medical and behavioral education of his parents by the medical and paramedical staff in the hospital and in the respiratory clinic.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Nocturnal airflow obstruction, histamine, and the autonomic central nervous system in children with allergic asthma.A study was carried out to investigate whether an imbalance in the autonomic nervous system or release of histamine, or both, is responsible for the nocturnal increase in airflow obstruction in asthmatic children. The study comprised 18 children with allergic asthma, nine with (group 1) and nine without (group 2) nocturnal airflow obstruction, and an age matched control group. All drugs were withheld for three days before and during the study. On day 4 each child was admitted to hospital and a series of measurements was made every four hours for 24 hours. These included measurements of the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), heart rate and sinus arrhythmia gap from an electrocardiogram (an indirect measure of parasympathetic activity) and urine sampling for determination of catecholamine and N'-methylhistamine concentrations (measures of sympathetic activity and histamine release respectively). Urinary N'-methylhistamine excretion was significantly higher over the 24 hours in children in group 1 than in children in group 2, and overnight values were also significantly higher in children in group 1 than those in group 2. Mean (SEM) values (mumol/mol creatinine) were 154.6 (11.2) in group 1 and 110 (11.2) in group 2 for 2400-0400 hours samples and 139.2 (13.1) and 101.2 (10.6) 0400-0800 hours samples. There was no evidence of decreased sympathetic or increased parasympathetic activity in association with the nocturnal airflow obstruction; noradrenaline concentrations were increased in group 1. These observations indicate that nocturnal airflow obstruction is associated with increased release of histamine overnight.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Fundamental studies on measurement of the eosinophil cationic protein in sputum from patients with bronchial asthma].One of the characteristics of patients with bronchial asthma is activation of eosinophils in the bronchi, which can be evaluated by measuring concentrations of the cationic granule proteins. Sputum seems to be the best material to evaluate the activation of eosinophils in the bronchi because it can be collected easily from the same patient every day even if he (she) has an asthmatic attack. Recently it has become possible to measure the concentration of the eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) thanks to the availability of the ECP RIA kit. However no fundamental studies have been carried out on the handling of sputum samples, and whether only ECP released into sputum is measured. We prepared supernatants of sputum samples according to the method of Gleich and others by adding the same volume of physiological saline, mixing it for one minute by a vortex mixer and centrifuging at 40000 Xg, 4 C, for 30 minutes. We found that the measurement of ECP is not inhibited by materials in sputum supernatants through a dilution test and a recovery test. We also found that the followings did not influence the measurement of ECP; the times of dilution, the duration from collection to handing of sputum, the solution added to sputum, and the gravity of centrifugation. In addition, it was suggested that only ECP released into sputum is measurable from the results of an electron microscopic study and the measurement of ECP after centrifugation following the addition of white blood cells to sputum.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Eosinophil chemotactic activity in the supernatant of mononuclear cell culture stimulated with specific antigen].Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) separated from patients with asthma who were sensitive to Dermatophagoides farinae (Df) were cultured in alpha-medium for 5 days at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2, in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml of Df antigen. Eosinophils were purified from the peripheral blood of patients with eosinophilia who were not sensitive to Df. Eosinophil chemotactic activity (ECA) was tested using a modified Boyden chamber method. ECA in the supernatant of PBMC stimulated with Df antigen was detectable after 24 hrs, peaked at 72 hrs and continued throughout the experiment. ECA was not observed in the supernatant of PBMC culture from subjects who were not sensitive to Df, and negligible activity was also observed when PBMC were stimulated with an unrelated antigen. The activity was unchanged by heating at 56 degrees C for 30 min, but was inactivated at 100 degrees C for 10 min. CV-6209, a specific PAF antagonist, failed to inhibit this chemotactic activity. The molecular weight of this eosinophil chemotactic factor (ECF) was greater than 30,000 daltons as determined by an ultrafiltration study. In conclusion, these data suggest that in asthmatic patients sensitive to Dermatophagoides farinae mononuclear cells stimulated with a related antigen produce one of cytokine(s) which possess(es) ECA, and may play an important role in the recruitment of eosinophils in chronic asthma.\n",

The 91 patients were followed for 52 weeks. Our primary finding was that the development of bronchial asthma was inhibited in the ketotifen group compared to the placebo controlled group with a statistically significant degree (p less than 0.001). We also found that clinical symptoms of atopic dermatitis were significantly improved in the ketotifen group (p less than 0.001). Only 5 patients complained of mild side effects.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Involvement of platelet activating factor (PAF) in ovalbumin antigen-induced late asthmatic response and increase of airway hyperresponsiveness in a guinea pig experimental model of asthma].Platelet activating factor, a potent chemical mediator, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma in terms of inflammatory cell recruitment and activation. We have recently demonstrated that repeated antigen (ovalbumin; OA) exposure by inhalation to guinea pigs results in a development of late asthmatic response (LAR) in more than 50% of the animals and significant increase in airway hyperresponsiveness (AH). We have studied the effect of WEB 2086, a specific PAF receptor-antagonist, on this model. Respiratoly resistance (Res) of guinea pigs was measured by a oscillation technique and AH was evaluated by the provocative concentration of aerosols of histamine causing 200% increase of Rrs over the baseline Rrs (PC200 Hist). Four out of 5 actively sensitized and diphenhydramine-pretreated animals developed LAR 3 to 9 hr after allergen (20 mg/ml OA, 10 min inhalation)-induced immediate bronchoconstriction (LAR). Treatment with WEB 2086 (3 mg/kg intravenously) 30 min before and 3 hr after the exposure suppressed LAR clearly without affecting the IAR. Significant increase in AH from 2.80 +/- 0.03 to 2.51 +/- 0.01 and 2.60 +/- 0.08 (p less than 0.05, n = 8) of PC200 Hist (mg/ml, log) was observed 24 hr and 5 day after the OA exposure, respectively. The WEB 2086 treatment also prevented the increase of AH after the OA exposure (PC200 Hist; 2.82 +/- 0.09 before the challenge 2.80 +/- 0.07 and 2.75 +/- 0.09 24 hr and 5 days after, respectively. n = 8). Administration of WEB 2086 did not affect baseline Rrs and PC200 Hist in normal guinea pigs without any antigen challenge. We conclude that WEB 2086 is capable of preventing the development of LAR and increase in AH, and thus PAF may play an important causal role in LAR and increased AH observed in asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT A pilot study of surfactant inhalation in the treatment of asthmatic attack.The pulmonary surfactant is thought to be important in the stability of the small airways. In this study, we conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine whether surfactant inhalation has a therapeutic effect in asthmatic attack. Eleven patients with asthmatic attack whose conditions were stable for at least six hours before the study were randomly assigned to placebo or surfactant inhalation. Respiratory function tests and blood gas analysis were performed before and 20 minutes after the treatment. After placebo administration, no significant change was observed from baseline in pulmonary functions. After surfactant administration (1 ml; 10 mg per milliliter), respiratory functions were markedly improved in all patients. The mean (+/- SE) change in the FVC, FEV1.0, MMF, delta N2 and PaO2 was, respectively, an increase of 11.7 +/- 1.3% (p less than 0.001), an increase of 27.3 +/- 4.4% (p less than 0.05), an increase of 33.3 +/- 4.7% (p less than 0.05), a decrease of 31 +/- 8.4% (p less than 0.05) and an increase of 13.4 +/- 0.8% (p less than 0.05). No difference was detected in PaCO2 after surfactant inhalation. This study indicates that airway surfactant is involved in the pathogenesis of bronchoobstruction of the patients with asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Asthma in New Zealand: implications for North America.In the early 1980s, reports of a significant rise in asthma mortality emanated from New Zealand. Difficulties in accessing medical care, noncompliance with medication, inadequate medical management, lack of patient education, and inadequate recognition of asthma severity have been suggested as factors that may have contributed to the excess of asthma mortality. Asthma mortality has now declined significantly in New Zealand. We traveled to New Zealand to examine why the incidence of asthma deaths declined in that country at the time where it may have continued to rise in North America. We hypothesize that increased patient and physician education, targeting of high-risk socioeconomic groups, and increased public awareness have played a large role in these improved statistics. The measures taken in New Zealand which have involved a cooperative approach between lay organizations, the pharmaceutical industry, government agencies, and medical personnel may be adapted to North America with, it is hoped, similar results.\n",

Phenytoin significantly reduced the frequency and severity of asthma attacks, coughing, nocturnal awakenings, and work absenteeism, and improved effort tolerance and subjective sense of well being. Phenytoin also reduces corticosteroid requirements of steroid-dependent patients.

      "ABSTRACT Identification of soybean dust as an epidemic asthma agent in urban areas by molecular marker and RAST analysis of aerosols.From 1981 to 1987, 26 outbreaks of asthma have occurred in the city of Barcelona, Spain, affecting a total of 687 subjects and causing 1155 emergency room admissions. Assays of urban aerosols collected with high-volume samplers between October 1986 and May 1989 have indicated that soybean dust originating from harbor activities (and not traffic or industrial pollution) is the causal agent for these epidemics. Soybean particulates in the filters have been characterized from the composition of the alcohol fraction, namely, campesterol, stigmasterol, beta-sitosterol, n-triacontan-1-ol, and n-dotriacontan-1-ol, constituting a series of aerosol components correlated with the epidemiologic data. This result has also been confirmed by immunochemical assay of specific soybean allergens. The concentration of these sterols in the air corresponds to a 24-hour average level of soybean dust in the order of 25 micrograms/m3 on epidemic days. These results suggest the advisability of monitoring soybean dust in air particulates of populated areas surrounding soybean storage or processing plants. The techniques presented here afford a simple way for the recognition of soybean dust in aerosols containing high concentrations of organic pollutants of traffic or industrial origin.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The distribution of bronchial responsiveness to histamine and exercise in 527 children and adolescents.The aim of the study was to describe the bronchial responsiveness to inhaled histamine and exercise in a randomly selected group of 527 children and adolescents from Copenhagen, aged between 7 to 16 years. The distribution of the bronchial responsiveness was described as (1) the provoking concentration that causes a 20% reduction in FEV1 (2) the dose-response slope (DRS), that is, the linear slope of the dose-response curve, and (3) reduction in FEV1 after 6 minutes of exercise on a treadmill. The distribution of the concentration that causes a 20% reduction in FEV1 in the responsive range was not significantly different from a unimodal distribution, although the findings were skewed toward the less responsive end of the range (p greater than 0.05). The subjects with asthma represented a subgroup within the responsive distribution tail rather than a separate distribution peak. In asymptomatic individuals, the values of DRS were distributed symmetrically on a logarithmic scale. The deviation from normal was such that the standard deviation only slightly underestimated the \"normal\" range. The distribution of the bronchial response to exercise was found to be significantly different from a normal distribution. However, a significant relationship was found between the bronchial response to inhaled histamine and exercise (p less than 0.0001). We conclude that there is a log-normal distribution of the bronchial response to inhaled histamine in a random sample of children and adolescents.\n",

      "ABSTRACT House dust mite sensitization in children and residential characteristics in a temperate region.House dust mite (Hdm) infestation used to be rare in Stockholm, but Hdm-sensitized children are now frequently observed, which probably indicates an increased infestation rate. This study was performed to elucidate determinants of Hdm sensitization in children living in the area. In a case-control study, 53 Hdm-sensitized children (cases), a group of non-Hdm-sensitized atopic children (N = 54), and a group of nonallergic neighborhood children (N = 53) were included. Mattress dust was analyzed with ELISA for content of Hdm allergens. Indoor humidity and temperature were measured, and questionnaire data were collected. Asthma was significantly more common in the Hdm-sensitized group than in the atopic control group. Hdm allergens were found in 40%, 19%, and 23% of the dust samples of the case group, atopic group, and neighborhood control groups, respectively. Only 15% of the dust samples of the Hdm-sensitized children contained Hdm allergens above the recommended threshold levels of sensitization of 2000 ng/gm of dust. Inadequate ventilation, which partly appeared to be a consequence of energy saving, appeared to be a risk factor for Hdm sensitization. This result may apply also to other temperate regions and suggests that the problem is preventable.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The recognition and control of occupational disease.Occupational diseases account each year in the United States for an estimated 50,000 to 70,000 deaths and 350,000 new cases of illness. Often, however, occupational diseases are not correctly diagnosed, because they mimic diseases due to other causes and because most physicians are not well trained in their recognition. Opportunities for prevention and treatment are therefore lost. The occupational history is the most effective means for proper diagnosis of occupational illness. It should routinely be obtained for every patient. A brief but systematic guide for obtaining an occupational history is presented in this report. Also, approaches are summarized for the recognition and diagnosis of such important occupational diseases as occupational cancer, asbestosis and other respiratory disorders, and occupational neuropsychologic disorders. The management and prevention of occupational diseases depend on reduction of hazardous exposures in the workplace and better education of workers, industrial managers, and physicians. This report outlines a program for the control of occupational disease based on (1) preventing exposures in the workplace, (2) premarket toxicity testing of new chemicals and technologies, and (3) astute clinical diagnosis.\n",

The results were as follows: 75.6% in remission, 18.2% improved, 4.0% unchanged, 0.9% worse and 1.3% dead from asthma. The average age of onset was 2.7 years, about 1 year earlier than that in our report of 1965. The average age of remission (growing out of asthma) was 13.0 years for males and 12.3 years for females. The prognosis was significantly poorer among asthmatics with an onset age of under 2 years, with a 10-year history of asthma before the first visit to our hospital, with severe attack at the initial visit, a history of admissions for the attacks and food allergy. The asthmatic children with food allergy had a 1-year earlier onset of attack, a more severe attack at the initial visit, more eczema in infancy, and 2 or more other allergic complications than children without food allergy.

      "ABSTRACT Trends in asthma mortality in New Zealand, 1908-1986.Trends in mortality from asthma in non-Maori New Zealanders aged 5 to 34 years were examined for the period 1908-1986. Two previously documented epidemics of death from asthma occurred in the 1960s and the late 1970s. These epidemics are most likely to have been due to changes in the management of asthma: the introduction of isoprenaline forte by metered dose inhaler in the 1960s and inhaled fenoterol in the 1970s. A previously unreported rise in mortality, which was more gradual in onset and less severe, occurred in the 1940s and 1950s; a similar pattern occurred in England and Wales during the same period. It is unlikely that this increase in mortality was solely due to changes in diagnostic fashion or disease coding. Possible explanations include changes in the management or prevalence of asthma, or in environmental factors. It is notable that mortality was below 0.5 per 100,000 person-years prior to 1940, but has subsequently increased considerably. Thus, while modern methods for treating asthma have improved the quality of life of many asthmatics, mortality has increased during the period of their introduction and use.\n",

Of these, 262 children (2%) were treated in the Intensive Care Unit. Twenty-seven required mechanical ventilation on 34 occasions, being 0.3% of hospital asthma admissions. Five patients died, four due to brain death following respiratory arrest prior to intubation. The main complications were (i) barotrauma, which occurred in five patients on seven occasions (20%); (ii) a reversible myopathy which occurred in three patients treated with high dose corticosteroids and muscle relaxants. Follow-up of patients ventilated in intensive care revealed that all but one of the initial survivors was alive 1-5 years later, all patients required subsequent readmission to hospital for treatment of acute asthma and 78% had persistent rather than episodic asthma. Although uncommon, an episode of ventilation has a major impact on the family's understanding and future management of acute asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Platelet-activating factor (PAF) and PAF antagonists in asthma.PAF is produced by and activates inflammatory cells, such as monocytes/macrophages, mast cells, platelets, neutrophils, eosinophils and endothelial cells. Its ability to imitate anaphylaxis, inducing for instance bronchoconstriction (BC) in guinea-pigs, and its identification (and/or that of lyso-PAF) in exudates from shocked lungs, led to the hypothesis that PAF is involved in immediate hypersensitivity. Recent results of Bachelet et al. show that PAF reduces the increased cyclic AMP content of guinea-pig alveolar cell population exposed to PGE2, salbutamol or isoprenaline, which agrees with its hypothesized stimulating role in conditions where increased cyclic AMP may reduce mediator release. PAF antagonists are usually selected with in vitro platelet tests and their in vivo activity is characterized in normal animals. Recent data of Pretolani et al. demonstrate nevertheless that the antagonists may lose part of their ability to inhibit PAF itself if tested on lungs from actively sensitized guinea-pigs. These lungs differ from those of passively sensitized or of naive animals in that they become hyper-responsive to mediators (PAF, leukotriene D4 [LTD4], histamine, arachidonate [AA]): BC and formation of thromboxane A2 are enhanced, and histamine is released dose-dependently under conditions where it is absent from perfusates from LTD4, AA or PAF-stimulated naive lungs. Peripheral inflammatory cells (basophils, eosinophils, monocytes) are possibly recruited into the lungs of the actively sensitized animals sometime during the second and/or third week of sensitization, and provide a new target which may account for the enhanced lung responsiveness. Ultra-structural studies of Lellouch-Tubiana et al. (abstract in this meeting) support this concept. Neither the primary target nor the chemotactic substance responsible for the reported modifications are identified, but recent data of Bachelet et al, showing that alveolar populations from actively sensitized guinea-pigs are less responsive to the cyclic AMP stimulating effects of PGE2, salbutamol or isoprenaline suggest the existence of a cell defect which may be important for the triggering of allergen-induced BC and cell recruitment. Our present concept involves a \"pre-inflamed\" lung in actively sensitized guinea-pigs and in human asthmatics, a stand-by process following sensitization and which is revealed following the activation of a target cell. This may be the alveolar macrophage which releases substances (PAF, TXA2, IL1) likely to start BC and protracted cell recruitment and activation.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Epithelium-derived inhibitory factor in human bronchus.The potencies of histamine and methacholine were significantly increased by approximately 2- and 5-fold respectively in human non-diseased isolated bronchi on removal of the epithelium. In contrast, no increases in spasmogen potency were observed following epithelium removal in bronchi obtained from a sample of asthmatic human lung. The failure of epithelium removal to increase asthmatic bronchial sensitivity to histamine may have been due to a reduction in the release of an epithelium-derived inhibitory factor (EpDIF) resulting from disease-induced epithelial damage. A co-axial bioassay system in which endothelium-denuded rat aorta was used as the assay tissue was used to detect the release of a vasorelaxant EpDIF from human bronchial tissue. Histamine (100 microM) and methacholine (25 microM), in the presence of indomethacin (5 microM), reduced phenylephrine-induced tone in endothelium-denuded rat aorta in co-axial assemblies by 75 +/- 11 and 67 +/- 9% respectively. Removal of the bronchial epithelium abolished these responses, indicating that they were mediated by an EpDIF. It is possible that human airway smooth muscle is sensitive to this vasorelaxant EpDIF and that the absence of the source of this factor following epithelium removal caused the increases in sensitivity to spasmogens. Alternatively, the human bronchial epithelium may also release an EpDIF selective for airway smooth muscle.\n",

The trial involved 46 school aged children suffering from infectious or infectious-atopic asthma. The post-Broncho-Vaxom treatment values for T lymphocytes were significantly higher in infectious, and significantly lower for B lymphocytes in infectious-atopic asthma. Serum alpha 1AT activity in children suffering from infectious asthma decreased significantly after the treatment. A correlation between the efficacy of the treatment and the lymphocyte percentage was observed. In children with very effective clinical results of Broncho-Vaxom treatment, the significant increase in T lymphocyte, and decrease in B lymphocyte populations was observed. Changes in T and B lymphocyte percentage were analysed in respect to alpha 1AT pre-treatment activity. In children with high alpha 1AT value, T lymphocytes after the treatment increased significantly in infectious, and B lymphocytes decreased significantly in infectious-atopic group.\n",

In patients receiving prednisone in a mean daily dose 5.0 +/- 4.8 mg, budesonide therapy enabled a reduction of the oral dose by 50 percent. A significant improvement in the psychophysical status of patients has been noted despite a lack of significant differences in the results of lung functioning tests. Adverse reactions such as relaxation, insufficiency of the vocal cords at phonation and hoarseness were seen in 20 percent of patients, and in one of them required cessation of the drug.

Our study was underwent on 15 out of 100 followed up asthmatic patients who did not respond to the usual treatments and demonstrated the usual treatments and demonstrated the intervention of the gastroesophageal reflux. Its presence was suggested clinically by the symptoms (pyrosis, dysphagia, acid regurgitations) and confirmed in 5 patients by the barium examination in Trendelenburg and in the remainder of 10 by the esophageal pH, determination of gastroesophageal motility and endoscopic examination. Excepting the known allergenic conditions, the attacks were recorded during night or postprandially, being usually preceded by the above mentioned symptoms. The antispastic and antisecretory treatment improved the respiratory symptoms. The recognition of this association, i.e. bronchial asthma-gastroesophageal reflux, has a practical importance, the intervention of the esophageal component leading to the termination of the attacks.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Clear definitions of chronic bronchopulmonary diseases: a necessity for practice, teaching and research in pneumology].Important divergences in the definition of bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis and pulmonary emphysema have persisted until the middle 1950's. Definitions were first standardized in 1958 by a group of British specialists (CIBA symposium) and made more accurate by the WHO Experts Group on Cor Pulmonale in 1961 and by the American Thoracic Society in 1962. The standardized questionnaire proposed by the British Medical Research Council has been widely adopted. As regards pulmonary emphysema, a precise definition based on anatomical data (dilatation of terminal air spaces with destruction of their walls) has been accepted. For lack of a better basis, chronic bronchitis is defined in clinical terms (almost daily productive cough 3 months each year, at least on 2 consecutive years); the terms \"chronic cough\" and \"recurrent bronchitis\" are still controverted. The greatest difficulties have been encountered in the definition of bronchial asthma; despite a second CIBA symposium (1971) devoted to this problem, it has not been possible to improve on the fairly wide physiological definition put forward in 1958 (bronchial obstruction that varies either spontaneously or under the influence of treatment). For about 15 years peripheral airways obstruction (PAO), sometimes called \"small airways disease\" has been recognized as a special anatomical and functional syndrome.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Role of intrathoracic pressure in changes in the greater and lesser circulation hemodynamics in patients with bronchial asthma].The greater and lesser circulation hemodynamics was examined in 59 patients with bronchial asthma and 23 controls by tetrapolar rheography, kinetocardiography, and ultrasonic Doppler cardiography. Simultaneously measurements of intrathoracic pressure (ITP) were carried out with an esophageal controller. Reduced stroke index, increased total peripheral resistance of the vessels, and elevated systolic pressure in the pulmonary artery were revealed in the patients as against the controls. ITP values in asthmatics surpassed twofold those in the reference group. To reveal elevated ITP effects on the hemodynamics, the authors have examined the hemodynamic parameters during Valsalva's test (with elevation of oral pressure up to 25-35 mm Hg) in 16 reference subjects. The results evidence the leading role of elevated ITP on the greater and lesser circulation hemodynamics in asthma. Elevated ITP lowers the venous blood flow to the heart and reduces the preload thus decreasing the blood flow to the lesser circulation and not increasing the pulmonary artery systolic pressure.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Plasma exudation in tracheobronchial and nasal airways: a mucosal defence mechanism becomes pathogenic in asthma and rhinitis.Plasma exudation into airway tissue and lumen is a defence and inflammatory reaction. If exaggerated it may become pathogenic as in asthma and rhinitis. Exuded plasma contains an abundance of mediators (kinins, complement fragments, fibrinolysis- and coagulation-peptides etc.) which have direct inflammatory and obstructive actions and which can attract, prime, and activate inflammatory cells. The plasma exudate may cause airway hyperresponsiveness by increasing mucosal thickness. In the lumen the exuded plasma is added to irritant and viscous secretions and plugs. Antiasthma and antirhinitic drugs, including glucocorticoids, disodium cromoglycate, beta-adrenoceptor agonists and xanthines, have anti-exudative actions that may include a direct reduction of vascular permeability and other anti-inflammatory effects. Recent data with nasal and tracheobronchial airways in guinea-pigs and humans suggest that plasma can pass into the airway lumen without disturbing the integrity of the epithelial lining as a barrier to inhaled molecules. Potent proteins from circulating plasma can, thus, promptly appear on the surface of a normal mucosa to neutralize offending materials. It is proposed that plasma exudation must be considered a first line mucosal defence system along with mucociliary transport in the airways.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Vascular beds in the airways of normal subjects and asthmatics.In humans a rich network of capillaries runs subepithelially from the central airways to the level of the peripheral bronchioles, where it anastomoses with the alveolar capillaries. The tracheobronchial capillaries converge to form venules extending to a deeper plexus of larger venules and arterioles. Transmission electronmicroscopy shows capillaries very close to the epithelial basement membrane, but not in the epithelium itself. There are two main differences in the bronchial mucosal vascular bed between healthy controls and asthmatics. In 60% of asthmatics there are endothelial gaps in the bronchial mucosal microvasculature compared to none in controls. Half of asthmatics have eosinophils adhered in the bronchial mucosal venules and capillaries, but none are seen in controls. Neutrophils are even more common than eosinophils in the bronchial mucosal capillaries and venules, but they are also found in the venules of one control out of four. The finding of inflammatory cells in the bronchial vessels suggests possible chemotaxis in asthmatics.\n",

Twelve asthmatics developed greater than or equal to 15% reduction in the forced expired volume in 1 s (FEV1), 2 h after less than or equal to 100 mg oral propranolol; cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blockade was confirmed by cycle exercise tests in the 19 without airway response.

A correlation was demonstrated between the PC20 values for asthmatics with a negative oral test (r = 0.72, P less than 0.001, n = 19) but not for the remainder (r = 0.14, P greater than 0.05, n = 12). Plasma propranolol concentrations (CL, ng.ml-1) after the final oral dose did not correlate with the % delta FEV1 (26.3) (r = -0.28) when an airway response was provoked or with the reduction in exercise tachycardia (25.9%) (r = 0.31) when no bronchoconstriction occurred. CL exceeded the limit of detection after the final inhaled propranolol dose (7.5 ng.ml-1) and was weakly related to the PC20 propranolol value (r = 0.53, P = 0.01, n = 27).

      "ABSTRACT Allergen-induced increase in airway responsiveness and inflammation in mild asthma.The relationship between airway responsiveness to methacholine and inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was determined in patients with history of rhinitis and/or mild bronchial asthma either at baseline (10 patients) or 3-4 h after allergen inhalation challenge (11 patients). At baseline, airway responsiveness did not correlate with any BAL cell population. When data obtained after allergen challenge were included in the analysis, 44% of the variability of airway responsiveness was explained by a multiple regression model with BAL eosinophils as a directly correlated (P = 0.002) independent variable and with BAL macrophages as an inversely correlated (P = 0.045) independent variable. Changes in airway responsiveness after allergen challenge were predicted (82% of variance explained) by a model with BAL eosinophils and BAL lymphocytes as directly correlated (P = 0.0002 and P = 0.03, respectively) independent variables. We conclude that, in stable asymptomatic asthma, baseline airway responsiveness does not correlate with the presence in the airways of inflammatory and immunoeffector cells that can be recovered by BAL. Nevertheless the allergen-induced increase in airway responsiveness is associated with an influx of eosinophils and lymphocytes in the bronchial lumen.\n",

We report on a case, in which a patient had markedly elevated urinary dopamine levels, due to increased renal dopamine synthesis, while receiving chronic corticosteroid therapy. Blockade of the renal dopamine synthesis, by carbidopa, markedly reduced urinary dopamine output and urinary sodium excretion. These findings provide further evidence for the hypothesis that intrarenal dopamine plays a role in sodium handling and may be of pathophysiological importance in counteracting the sodium-retaining effects of chronic corticosteroid therapy.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The allergy management of bronchial asthma in children in Surabaya.The allergy management of bronchial asthma consists of avoidance of exposure to allergens either inhalant, or ingestant, hyposensitization in cases where complete avoidance is impossible and drug therapy is needed. The diet initiated in allergic children is principally a diagnostic tool. There are two important diet regimens. First, \"The Elimination Diet\", indicated in patients to exclude major allergenic foods such as fruit, milk, egg, fish, and peanut. Secondly, \"The Minimal Diet\" (Modified Rowe's Diet), consisting of several foods \"allowed\" such as water, rice, coconut, beef, soy-cake, soy sauce, spinach, carrot, garlic and onion, salt and sugar, while other foods are prohibited. To obtain clear improvement of symptoms, the diet must be continued for 3 weeks. If improvement occurs, a challenge can be performed. All previously excluded foods can be reinstituted one at a time in a sufficient amount, every day for one week. If no symptoms appear, the food can be considered as non allergenic to the patient. If symptoms reappear, the food should be suspected as causing the allergy. For diagnosis, three challenges are required. Pharmacologic therapy is initiated with ephedrine and chlortrimeton as needed. Aminophylline and beta 2 agonist may be given as a substitute if the former drugs fail to relieve the symptoms. Intravenous aminophylline and corticosteroid are used especially in \"status asthmaticus\".\n",

Changes in blood lactate, glucose and catecholamine concentrations as a result of the two hour run were similar for the two groups. However, the pattern of breathing was different. The asthmatics had a slower breathing frequency but a similar tidal volume to the non-asthmatics. Both groups had an increase in the ventilation rate over the two hour run. For the non-asthmatic group, this increase in ventilation was achieved by an increase in the breathing frequency (p less than 0.01), whereas tidal volume was reduced (p less than 0.05). The increase in the ventilation rate over the two hour run for the asthmatic group was brought about by a small increase in breathing frequency (p less than 0.05), whereas tidal volume was not changed. This maintenance of the tidal volume by the asthmatic athletes during endurance running may compensate for the airflow obstruction, and so allow successful participation in endurance running.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Ethnicity as a possible factor contributing to the development of chronic airflow limitation and asthma.Race or ethnicity have occasionally been cited as possible factors contributing to the risk of developing obstructive lung disease. In a hospital based case-control study of Caucasian patients with asthma or chronic airflow limitation (CAL), we determined the frequency of each of five major European ethnic groups in the patients. We then compared the two patient groups to each other and to the frequencies reported by Canada Census and found significant differences in their ethnic constitution. Our results suggest that the British are more likely than other groups, especially North Eastern Europeans, to develop CAL, while North Eastern Europeans and Scandinavians are more likely to develop asthma. These differences could be due to genetic differences among the various groups or to environmental factors associated with particular ethnic groups. They suggest that ethnicity is an additional factor to consider in future epidemiological studies of CAL or asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Airway hyperreactivity, an introduction.Asthma is characterized by the presence of airway inflammation and an increased responsiveness to many different stimuli. The hyperresponsiveness to indirect stimuli such as adenosine, bradykinin, neuropeptides, sulphur dioxide suggest that the hyperresponsiveness in asthma results from the complex interaction between inflammatory cells, neurons and smooth muscle cells. Several mechanisms may be involved in the influence of airway inflammation on airway responsiveness: increased mucosa permeability: enhanced exposure of irritant receptors, modulation of airway smooth muscle behavior by inflammatory mediators, mucosal edema, enhanced release of neurotransmitters, increased local reflex activity, decreased breakdown of neurotransmitters, etc. We have investigated the interaction between airway inflammation and responsiveness in two animal models: acute exposure to endotoxin and chronic exposure to aerosolized antigen. Both models demonstrate the complexity of interaction between inflammatory processes and demonstrate positive controlling mechanisms that inhibit the increase in airway responsiveness due to airway inflammation. The lack of such controlling mechanisms may be involved in the development of the asthmatic airway hyperresponsiveness.\n",

Removal of the epithelium in vitro augments contraction and reduces relaxation to several bronchoactive agents and bioassay experiments have shown that the protective effects of the epithelium can be transferred to denuded preparations. It now seems likely that one or more epithelial-associated factors eg EpDRF and PGE2 have a protective role in controlling airway contractility. These findings may be important in asthmatics in vivo since there may be some correlation between epithelial damage/loss and airway hyperreactivity. The identity of EpDRF remains unknown but it does not appear to be a prostanoid and is distinct pharmacologically from EDRF found in blood vessels.\n",

A significantly higher number of eosinophils were hypodense in asthmatic children (n = 24) compared with allergic non-asthmatic (n = 10) and non-allergic children (n = 13), namely 484 +/- 348 cells/40 microliters versus 113 +/- 109 and 39 +/- 61 (p less than 0.001) respectively. We also observed by light and electron microscopy that the hypodense eosinophils of asthmatic children were swollen and their granules were dispersed, but the normodense eosinophils of the same patient were small and compact. In three cases of severe asthmatic attack, hypodense eosinophils found on admission decreased in number after intravenous aminophylline therapy and relief of symptoms. Moreover, a decreased number of hypodense eosinophils were found in seven cases of allergic children (p less than 0.05) after 2 weeks of anti-allergic drug treatment associated with relieved symptoms. From these data we concluded that the presence of hypodense eosinophils in the peripheral blood might be related to the development of allergic symptoms and might participate in the pathophysiology of allergic diseases in children.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Salicylate pre-treatment attenuates intensity of bronchial and nasal symptoms precipitated by aspirin in aspirin-intolerant patients.Aspirin (ASA) and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which are cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors, precipitate asthmatic attacks in ASA-intolerant patients, while sodium salicylate, hardly active on COX by itself, is well tolerated by these patients. However, salicylate moiety appears to interfere with aspirin inhibitory action on platelets and vascular COX. Such interaction, if present at the level of respiratory tract, may be of interest to pathogenesis of ASA-induced asthma. We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over study on the effect of choline magnesium trisalicylate (CMT, trilisate) pre-treatment on ASA-induced adverse reactions in nine patients. Pulmonary function tests, nasal symptoms score, PNIF and serum salicylate levels were monitored following challenges with threshold doses of ASA. Trilisate administered at a dose of 3000 mg daily for 3 days, offered a moderate protection against ASA-induced symptoms; it diminished the severity and/or delayed the appearance of FEV1 fall. Maximal decreases in FEV1 as well as reaction intensity indexes were significantly lower (P less than 0.02 and P less than 0.002, respectively) after trilisate pre-treatment as compared to placebo. Trilisate also attenuated nasal symptoms in three out of five patients. Although the precise mechanism of the protective action of trilisate is unknown, our data support the possibility of interaction between salicylate and ASA on cyclo-oxygenase locus in the respiratory tract in ASA-intolerant patients.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The inflammatory response in asthma exacerbation: changes in circulating eosinophils, basophils and their progenitors.Circulating eosinophils, basophils and eosinophil/basophil (Eo/B) progenitors were examined in 12 patients at the time of an exacerbation of asthma accompanied by sputum eosinophilia and after resolution of the exacerbation with inhaled corticosteroid treatment. Differential counts were performed and peripheral blood non-adherent mononuclear cells were cultured for 14 days in methyl-cellulose to determine the number of Eo/B and granulocyte-macrophage (GM) colonies without knowledge of the clinical conditions or findings. With resolution of the asthma exacerbation on beclomethasone therapy, there were significant falls in circulating eosinophils, basophils and Eo/B colonies whereas GM colonies were unchanged. To elucidate whether the observed changes could be due to systemic absorption or local action of inhaled corticosteroid, seven subjects with allergic rhinitis and no current evidence of lower airway inflammation (no symptoms of asthma and normal methacholine airway responsiveness) received 14 days' treatment with the same dose of inhaled beclomethasone or of placebo in a double-blind randomized cross-over study. No significant changes in airway function or in circulating cell counts were observed. The results suggest reduced production of eosinophils and basophils after the resolution of an exacerbation of asthma. This effect may be due to reduced levels of airway-derived eosinophil-basophil growth and differentiation factors.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Plasmapheresis in a patient with severe asthma associated with auto-antibodies to platelets.Although the pathogenesis of aspirin-sensitive asthma remains to be specified, it is known that in the presence of acetylsalicylic acid or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, platelets from aspirin-sensitive asthmatics have been described as generating cytocidal mediators that killed parasite targets such as Schistosoma mansoni larvae. Here we report, in a patient with corticosteroid-dependent asthma associated with aspirin sensitivity, the presence of circulating IgE antibodies against 55 kD and 68 kD platelet antigens. In addition, the serum from this patient was shown to contain a factor able to trigger the release of cytocidal mediators from his platelets as well as from normal individual platelets. This platelet stimulatory activity was presumably supported by IgE antibodies or immune complexes. After informed consent the patient was submitted to plasma exchanges. Plasma removal induced clinical improvement, anti-platelet antibody decrease, and the reduction of the platelet stimulatory activity. All clinical symptoms disappeared within 2 weeks. The disease remained quiescent for 2 months, and daily requirements for prednisone (20-5 mg), and beta-agonist (10-16 to 0-1 inhalations) could be kept at a low level follow-up. The plasma exchanges were delayed by 3 mg kg-1 azathioprine with the maintenance of clinical improvement. A relapse occurred after the arrest of immunosuppressive therapy with the reappearance of both asthma attacks and anti-platelet antibodies, as well as the increase of the platelet stimulatory activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

Ketotifen was given in a dose of 1 mg twice daily for 16 weeks. At the end of this period, concomitant medication, frequency and severity of asthma attacks and mean lung function test results were analysed. The number of acute asthmatic attacks were reduced significantly from a mean of 7.1 attacks/week before treatment to 0.28 attacks/week after 16 weeks of treatment (P less than 0.001). The severity of attacks and the need to use concomitant bronchodilators agents were also reduced. Lung function improved following oral ketotifen administration as indicated by changes in FVC, FEV1, FEV1% FVC and PEF. FVC increased insignificantly (18.64 ml/week, P less than 0.3), while FEV1, FEV1% FVC and PEF improved significantly (33.45 ml/week, 0.76%/week and 5.52 l/min/week respectively, P less than 0.01). It was concluded that the relief which is often observed in patients suffering from bronchial asthma on ketotifen therapy is associated with an improvement in the lung function. Hence, ketotifen is effective in the prophylaxis of both extrinsic and intrinsic asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The efficacy and safety of a controlled release formulation of salbutamol in the management of patients with asthma in Nairobi, Kenya.The treatment of asthma in Africa is influenced by cultural and environmental factors as well as the availability of drugs. Poor compliance with regard to long-term maintenance treatment of chronic asthma is also a problem in Africa. The present study reports on 45 patients from 2 centres in Nairobi treated with 8 mg twice daily of an oral controlled release formulation of salbutamol (\"Volmax\"). The treatment produced a significant improvement in lung function measured by the PEFR compared with baseline data on previous therapy. Controlled release salbutamol was rated as effective or very effective by 84.2% of patients and for 81.6% of patients their physicians preferred this preparation to the therapy used before the study. Side effects were infrequent and usually occurred during the first few days of treatment. The study which is the first report in Africa to assess this novel formulation of salbutamol in a group of African patients, demonstrates that controlled release salbutamol 8 mg administered twice daily is safe and effective, offering benefits over current therapies in the treatment of asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Long-term multicentric study with azelastine in patients with intrinsic asthma.Efficacy and tolerance of azelastine (A 5610; CAS 58581-89-8), a new antiallergic compound with a unique structure, were investigated over up to one year of treatment in 225 male and female out-patients (age mean +/- s = 48 +/- 13 years) suffering from chronified intrinsic asthma. The trial was conducted by 24 German and Austrian consulting physicians of pneumology. Plasma levels indicated sufficient compliance in almost 90% of the patients. Tablets containing 4.4 mg azelastine HCl were administered b.i.d. in addition to the pre-existing antiasthmatic medication. Only other antiallergic agents were excluded. Adverse events, vital parameters and laboratory tests on safety were tightly assessed. Eighteen patients dropped out because of adverse events, 78 reported adverse experiences under therapy, normally mild and \"vegetative\" symptoms. No indicative findings regarding blood pressure, heart rate and laboratory tests were seen. The most frequent observations were taste disorders, asthenia and weight gain. No serious side effects at all were reported. The results on efficacy obtained from this non-controlled study may be predicative due to a baseline validation by an initial single blind placebo controlled run-in phase. Statistically significant improvements were seen for FEV1 and for the physicians' and the patients' rating on efficacy. To a lesser extent peak flow and airway resistance were improved, too. Thus, azelastine was safely tolerated over one year and might be effective in intrinsic asthma.\n",

ABC 99 was observed to have marked anti-inflammatory activity in a series of experimental trials involving the principal mediators of inflammation (PAF, histamine, serotonin, LTC4-like substances, etc). It inhibits the formation of oedemas induced both by carrageenin and PAF in the rat paw, and reduces the increase in vascular permeability induced by histamine and serotonin. ABC 99 was also found to inhibit PAF-induced pleurisy, reducing the volume of pleural exudate and the presence of LTC4-like substances in the pleural cavity. When administered subacutely, ABC 99 checks the formation of granulation tissue caused by the subcutaneous implantation of cotton pellets in the rat. These experimental results indicate ABC 99 may be of particular interest in the treatment of respiratory disorders involving obstructive inflammation and bronchial hypersensitivity.\n",

Guinea pigs were immunized with OA in Freund's complete adjuvant and lymphocyte stimulation tests were done with cells from the tracheobroncheal lymph nodes (TBL) draining the airways, from peripheral blood lymphocytes and from the axillary and inguinal lymph nodes. The TBL of the IMM/R strain had a significantly lower response than those of the IMM/S strain. This selectively low response, which was not antigen specific, could be increased by cyclophosphamide pretreatment. The high TBL response in the IMM/S strain was decreased by OA inhalations to the level of the IMM/R strain. OA inhalations decreased the IgE response in the IMM/S but not the IMM/R strain. Different interpretations of these findings are discussed, with emphasis on the possibility that an inherent suppressor cell population in the TBL are involved.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Density distribution and density conversion of neutrophils in allergic subjects.We investigated the density distribution of neutrophils in peripheral blood of allergic subjects. We divided neutrophils into four groups: fraction 1 (density greater than 1.085), fraction 2 (1.081 less than density less than or equal to 1.085), fraction 3 (1.077 less than density less than or equal to 1.081) and fraction 4 (density less than or equal to 1.077). The percentage of neutrophils in fraction 2 in allergic rhinitis (AR) subjects or asthmatics was lower than that in normals (p less than 0.01). The percentage of neutrophils in fraction 3 and fraction 4 from AR or asthmatics was greater than that in normals (fraction 3, p less than 0.01; fraction 4, p less than 0.05). In neutrophils from AR subjects (fraction 3), chemotaxis to N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine or platelet-activating factor (PAF) was enhanced compared to fraction 2. PAF (10(-7) M) changed the density of neutrophils (p less than 0.01), which were inhibited by WEB 2086 (p less than 0.05). Furthermore, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor changed the density of neutrophils (p less than 0.01). These findings suggest that biological agents may activate neutrophils and convert their density resulting in neutrophils with lower density in allergic subjects.\n",

Subjective verbal reports were coded blindly for evidence of perceptual distortions presumably indicative of denial of separation anxiety. Low scores on two items measuring sensitivity to separation anxiety and intolerance of aloneness were, as predicted, significantly more often characterized by codings of denial on the tachistoscopic exposures than subjects with high sensitivity to separation anxiety. Stability of effect became stronger when only very low and very high scores were compared for perceptual denial on the last four presentations of the series. This technique, employing other types of anxiety-evoking stimuli, may represent a reliable instrument to reveal the presence of defences toward each of the most relevant conflictual areas of the personality.\n",

Their proteins and hexoses were recorded with a LKB Uvicord spectrophotometer and quantified by the Lowry and the indol techniques. On the other hand an animal model was developed in rabbits and an IgG precipitin and hemagglutinating antibodies were obtained. The PN extract as well as those fractions with the higher protein content appeared positive when they were checked against the antiserum by means of Ouchterlony, Boyden and immunoelectrophoresis. The molecular weight of PN was established in 52,000 daltons approximately in comparison with well known marker proteins. Adult human beings suffering perennial rhinitis and bronchial asthma showed positive type I skin tests with PN and its most conspicuous fractions (glycoproteins). A RAST-IgE-anti-PN was prepared following Ceska's procedure and challenged against all human sera. Only 40% of the patients revealed a positive RAST IgE-anti-PN which correlated significatively with the protein fractions (35%) and with the skin tests (43% and 39%, respectively). These results reinforced the idea that PN is a potent antigenic mold both in animals and in humans in whom we detected an IgE specific antibody presumably related to their atopic clinical condition.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Prevention of allergic diseases and IgE dosification in cord sera.In 1986, a Program on Prevention of Allergic Diseases was initiated in our country which was possible on account of the organization conditions of our health system. The program includes IgE measurement in umbilical cord serum by means of an ultramicroanalytic technique for IgE quantification. This is an heterogeneous sandwich-type immunoassay that requires only 10 microliters of reactive on each reaction step and its processing is carried out on the Cuban SUMA equipment. Two groups of children were selected and followed-up: group I included 80 one-year-old infants and group II included 60 18-months-old infants. Both groups followed hypoallergenic diets and had minimal exposure to aeroallergens within their microenvironment. Results were compared with those of respective control groups. Compliance of both groups with the prophylactic measures brought about a reduction in the existence of allergic diseases and a comparison with the control groups offered a statistically significant difference (p less than 0.001). Similarly, incidence of asthma was found more reduced in groups I and II than in the control groups (p less than 0.001). Within the groups treated under the Program on Prevention of Allergic Diseases, IgE values were lower, while the control groups exhibited a higher number of infants with figures of 200 IU/ml or more (p less than 0.05).

At the same time, plasma TXB2 and 6-K-PGF1 alpha were measured in 30 normal subjects for control. The results were as follows: (1) In the extrinsic asthmatics: The plasma TXB2 level measured during symptomatic period was significantly higher than that during asymptomatic period (P less than 0.05), while the plasma level of 6-K-PGF1 alpha measured during symptomatic period was significantly lower than that of normal subjects (P less than 0.01). The ratio of TXB2/6-K-PGF1 alpha measured during symptomatic period was significantly higher than that measured during asymptomatic period and that measured in the normal subjects (P less than 0.05). (2) In intrinsic asthmatics: The plasma 6-K-PGF1 alpha level measured during symptomatic period was significantly lower than that of normal subjects. There was no significantly difference between either plasma TXB2 level or ratio of TXB2/6-K-PGF1 alpha measured during symptomatic period and that measured during asymptomatic period as well as that of normal subjects. From these results it is suggested that (1) The TXA2 and PGI2 may play a different role in different types of asthma, (2) The imbalance between TXA2-PGI2 may be one of the important factors that take part in the pathogenesis of extrinsic asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Long-term effects of budesonide on airway responsiveness and clinical asthma severity in inhaled steroid-dependent asthmatics.Budesonide 400 micrograms daily, in nonsteroid-dependent asthma, can produce improvements in airway responsiveness and clinical asthma severity, with some patients returning to normal responsiveness and becoming asymptomatic. This study examined whether similar improvements occur when asthmatics, who are dependent upon inhaled steroids, take either a regular maintenance dose of inhaled steroid or twice that amount for a year. Thirty two asthmatics were each stabilized on the minimum amount of inhaled steroid that would keep symptoms non-troublesome. In a double-blind, randomized manner, half were assigned to remain on a maintenance dose (MD) and the rest received twice that dose (MDx2) for one year. Before and monthly throughout the study, airway responsiveness to methacholine was measured and clinical asthma severity assessed by questionnaire, inhaled bronchodilator use and number of asthma exacerbations. There was a significant improvement in airway responsiveness and clinical asthma severity in both treatment groups. Those on MDx2 showed the greatest improvement but the difference between the two groups did not reach significance. This study provides strong evidence that prolonged use of inhaled steroids is associated with improvement in airway responsiveness and clinical asthma severity in inhaled steroid-dependent asthma with a suggestion that the improvements are dose related.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Are we recording peak flows properly in young children?Peak flow rate is used in young children to assess bronchodilator response and monitor asthma status at home. Frequently the best of only three peak flow manoeuvres is reported. The aim of this study was to assess if this was sufficient to give the maximum peak flow rate and to determine the reproducibility of the measurement. Thirty nine children aged between three and ten years were recruited. Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) was measured six times in each child at two minute intervals. Less than half (13 of 39) of the children made their maximum blow in the first three manoeuvres. The maximum peak flow from the second set of three blows was a median of 7% greater than that from the first three blows. The coefficient of variation of the measurement was 8.8% suggesting a change in PEFR greater than 17.6% is necessary to demonstrate a response to bronchodilator. We conclude three peak flow manoeuvres are insufficient in the majority of young children to demonstrate the maximum peak flow.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Current humoral profile in acute severe asthma].This study examined the relationships between acid-base disorders, hypoxemia, electrolyte imbalances, plasma adrenaline (Ad) and noradrenaline (NAd) in 94 patients with acute severe asthma. Criteria of inclusion were [PaO2 + PaCO2/.8] less than 140 mmHg when breathing air (FiO2 = 21%) and/or PaCO2 greater than or equal to 45 mmHg. PaCO2 was closely related to H+ in those patients with hypercapnia: H+ nmol/l = 0.88 PaCO2 + 4 (r 0.91 ; n = 61; p less than 0.001). However, among the 62 acidotic cases (pH less than or equal to 7.36), 24 were classified as respiratory, 22 as mixed and 16 as metabolic. A loose though highly significant relationship was found between PaO2 and PaCO2 (when breathing air). Blood lactate, which was 3.61 +/- 1.9 mmol/l (+/- SD), was not correlated with anion gap or H+, but was loosely related to PaO2 and kalemia. Ad (1.53 +/- 1.17 nmol/l) and NAd (5.85 +/- 3.44 nmol/l), measured at the time of admission in 27 patients (FIO2 = 21%), varied significantly from those of a control group (p less than 0.01). NAd was correlated with H+, lactate and especially PaCO2, whereas no correlation could be established for Ad with these factors or NAd values. On the average, kalemia, phosphatemia and calcemia were lowered. In conclusion, mixed and metabolic acidosis were more common in this study than in a previous personal series and were not necessarily associated with an increase in blood lactate. Drugs taken prior to hospitalization must be considered in the pathophysiology of hyperlactatemia, which appears to be one among several factors linked to NAd levels.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and Candida albicans colonization of the respiratory tract in corticosteroid-dependent asthma.Fungal studies were conducted on 35 patients with corticosteroid-dependent asthma (CSDA) and 20 asthmatics who had never received prednisolone. Candida albicans was repeatedly cultured from the sputa of 12 patients with CSDA. Isolation was more frequent in those patients who were receiving more than 10 mg prednisolone for more than six months. Nearly half of these patients demonstrated a positive immediate cutaneous reaction and precipitating antibodies against C. albicans. Although no pathological significance, beside colonization, could be attributed to this finding, it was felt that it would be prudent to restrict the daily dose of prednisolone to less than 10 mg, when administered for more than six moths. Two patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), were identified, one from each group. The possibility of ABPA, however, remained open in two other patients with CSDA. It is probable that some patients with CSDA may be suffering from ABPA but characteristic features of the disease are masked by costicosteroid therapy, making it difficult to diagnose.\n",

      "ABSTRACT A longitudinal study of risk factors in asthma and chronic bronchitis in childhood.The prevalence, persistence, incidence and remission rates of reported diagnosed asthma and chronic bronchitis has been studied longitudinally over ten years in a representative community sample of children and adolescents. The objectives are to evaluate the rates of change over time, the role of family history of disease, and the social risk factors in the longitudinal course of disease. The relationship between the two reported diagnoses is very high, about half of each group having the other diagnosis. Each diagnosis has specific symptoms with which it is associated. Remission of clinical disease is associated with continuing symptoms in about half of such cases. The incidence rates and remissions of cases as they have occurred over time were associated with different symptoms and risk factors. A family history of lung disease and family social characteristics are significant risk factors affecting the presence of these diseases, and how they change. Discussion suggests these factors may affect possible precursors, such as lower respiratory tract illnesses, as well as personal habits (such as smoking), which are related to both diagnoses. Further, the interactions of these risk factors appear to significantly influence impairments of lung function at the beginning of adult life, and potential subsequent disease.\n",

The paper deals with the most frequent mechanisms of bronchoconstriction in occupational asthma combined with inflammatory process. The importance of inflammation in the Moira Chan-Yeung classification of occupational asthma is emphasized. According to this classification several types of occupational asthma are associated with the working environment. It is stressed that continuing prophylaxis of inflammation should protect the worker from irreversible airflow obstruction.

      "ABSTRACT Successes and failures in the treatment of bronchial asthma.In the past decade a spectacular development could be observed in the field of antiasthmatic drugs. Though the new drugs did not produce radical change but they created a wide range of treatment possibilities. This paper is dealing with three, probably most rapidly developing fields of asthma therapy. 1. Immunotherapy. The most important allergens could be isolated in a high purity with up-to-date chemical analitical methods. This affords possibility for a more reliable determination of individual sensitivity and desensitizing treatment. 2. Mediator release blocking drugs. While common antiasthmatic medicaments try to counterbalance the effect of chemical mediators released by antigen-antibody reaction, the former partly block mediator release but also decrease bronchial hyperreactivity characteristic of asthma. 3. Glucocorticosteroids. Recent halogenized steroid preparations did not diminish the risk of severe side effects. Their application is limited in time, they are used mainly for the prevention and treatment of asthmatic crisis. Among aerosolized steroids, preparations considered as optimal have local effect but they are slightly absorbed from the mucous membrane. In spite of the new drugs, medication depending on individual sensitivity, actual complaints and lung function values is essential, the asthmatic needs continuous care based on symptoms, complaints.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [The role of different microorganisms and infectious processes in the occurrence and course of bronchial asthma].The role of infection in bronchial asthma (BA) is unknown. The pathogenesis of BA contributes to the origin of infectious processes induced by different microorganisms. In view of the predominance of associations of viruses and bacteria in the etiology and pathogenesis of acute respiratory infections, it is difficult to define in vivo the share and role of these microorganisms which participate in the origin and enhancement of hypersensitivity, hyperreactivity and alterations in beta-adrenoreactivity. Some factors of bacterial pathogenicity promote BA progress. On contact with basophils and mast cells bacteria (both pathogenic ones and ordinary commensals) are capable of liberating histamine and other mediators during colonization of the bronchial tree and origin other infectious process. This mechanism of mediator liberation may contribute to the transformation of pre-asthma to BA or provoke its exacerbation.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [The complex assessment of disordered bronchial patency in chronic obstructive lung diseases].There were 63 patients with infectious-allergic bronchial asthma and 13 patients with chronic obstructive bronchitis. The clinical and bronchoscopic manifestations of the broncho-obstructive syndrome were compared to external respiratory function (ERF) reflecting the status of bronchial patency at different levels of the bronchial tree and the measurement data on the rheological properties of bronchial secretion. A reverse interrelationship was discovered between the intensity of asphyxia attacks and patency of the distal bronchial according to the ERF estimates. A correlation was noted between the magnitude of bronchial secretion viscosity and some characteristics: intensity of asphyxia attacks, dyspnea, number of dry rales; bronchial patency according to the ERF estimates. The values of secretion viscosity turned out to be most closely interrelated with the patency of small bronchi. A correlation was discovered between the bronchoscopic findings and bronchial patency of the proximal bronchi (ERF estimates). It is believed that bronchoscopic examination plays an important part in the diagnosis of obstruction of the bronchi accessible to inspection and has a high information content. Hyperdiscrinism intensity determines in many respects the clinical manifestations of the broncho-obstructive syndrome, measurement data on viscosity and adhesion of bronchial secretion can be used for assessing the efficacy of the action on bronchial obstruction at the level of small bronchi.\n",

Data from the literature clearly show that corticosteroid therapy may trigger the development of Kaposi's sarcoma in patients who usually possess several other pathogenetic factors of that disease, such as pre-existing immune deficiency, environmental (viruses) or genetic factors.

The following results were obtained: 1) The level of leukotrienes released from the leukocytes of asthmatic patients were higher than those of healthy subjects, but there was no significant difference in the levels of leukotrienes between mild and moderate asthmatic patients. 2) The levels of leukotriene B4 released from the leukocytes of the infectious-type asthmatic patients were higher than those of the atopic asthmatic patients (non-hyposensitized group). There was a tendency for levels of leukotriene C4 released from the leukocytes of the infectious-type asthmatic patients to be higher than those of the atopic-type asthmatic patients. 3) The levels of peptide leukotriene released from the leukocytes of the atopic hyposensitized patients were lower than those of the patients in the atopic non-hyposensitized group, but there were no significant differences in leukotriene B4 between the groups. In addition, the levels of leukotriene C4 released spontaneously from the leukocytes of the hyposensitized group of patients were lower than those in the non-hyposensitized group. 4) Though the mechanism of the efficacy of hyposensitization has not been completely clarified, the reduction of leukocyte ability to release peptide leukotrienes through immunotherapy seems to be part of this mechanism. These results suggest that leukotrienes may play some role in the pathogenesis of both atopic- and infectious-type bronchial asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Cough provocation test in asthmatic children].The effects of pH and osmolarity on cough receptors were evaluated by inhalation of aqueous aerosol in 37 children with bronchial asthma. Each of 3 different pH solutions (low 1.85-3.25, neutral 6.9-7.1, high 8.0-8.4) was combined with 3 different osmolarities (hypo 0-31, iso 254-292, hyper 830-1117 mOsm/kg), and 9 solutions were prepared. To evaluate the effect of low chloride ion concentration, neutral pH and iso-osmolar solution including low chloride ion was also prepared. These aqueous aerosols were administered from a Devilbiss 646 nebulizer for 10 seconds. Coughing was induced in 28 subjects (76%) by inhalation of low pH and hyperosmolar solution, in one subject (3%) by low pH and iso-osmolar, in one (3%) by low pH and hypo-osmolar, in three (8%) by neutral pH and hypo-osmolar, and in none by any of the other solutions. It was suggested that the alteration of pH or osmolarity alone could not induce coughing effectively, and that the combination of pH and osmolarity was the important factor for the induction of coughing.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Creola bodies and the eosinophil cationic protein in sputum in acute asthmatic attacks with respect to their clinical significance].Creola bodies (CrB) are characteristically present in sputa from patients with asthma. We studied the relationship among the numbers of CrB, the course of asthmatic attacks and the concentration of sputum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP). Twenty-two asthmatic attacks in 17 patients were studied. Sputum collections pulmonary function tests were made before or during treatment in patients who came to the outpatient clinic or emergency room. Smears of 100 microliters of sputum were made on glass slides and CrB were studied over the whole area of glass slide stained with Papanicolaou's stain. CrB scores were determined from the number and the size of CrB on each slide. In hospitalized patients the CrB scores, the concentrations of sputum ECP and the severity scores of asthmatic attacks were highest on the day of admission, decreasing in association with each other and returning to the baseline level in approximately 5 days. There were significant correlations among the CrB score, the concentration of sputum ECP and %FEV1.0 (p less than 0.001). The CrB score on the day of clinical appraisal significantly correlated with the number 6f days of treatment needed for remission. These results are in keeping with the hypothesis that eosinophils cause desquamation of respiratory epithelial cells resulting in prolongation of asthmatic attacks. Observation of CrB seemed to be useful as a marker of duration of asthmatic attacks.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [The participation of epithelial desquamation in the increase of bronchial hyperresponsiveness after antigen challenge in patients with bronchial asthma].Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) was evaluated before and after antigen challenge in 12 patients with bronchial asthma as allergic reaction to house dust mites. Six out of the 12 showed an increase in BHR 48 hours after antigen challenge. Although there was no difference in the decrease of FEV1.0 in IAR and LAR between patients with (group A) and without (group B) the increase of BHR after antigen challenge, patients in group A expectorated a significantly larger number of clumps of respiratory epithelial cells (Creola bodies, CrB) in their sputum in both IAR and LAR. In addition, the degree of the increase of BHR significantly correlated with the CrB score, which was determined from the number and the size of CrB. These results suggest that epithelial desquamation participates in the increase of BHR after antigen challenge. The concentration of the eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) in their sputum did not change significantly in IAR and LAR compared with that before antigen challenge. There was no difference in the concentration of ECP in their sputum between the two groups either. One antigen challenge seemed to be too mild to induce an elevation of the concentration of ECP in their sputum. Judging from the fact that CrB could be observed not only at LAR but also IAR, epithelial desquamation seemed to be dependent on the degree of damage before antigen challenge rather than on the activation of eosinophils after antigen challenge.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Measurement of response to methacholine inhalation challenge in asthma and allergic rhinitis. PC20 or PC35FEV1?It has been widely accepted that significant bronchial responsiveness is demonstrated by a 20% fall in the FEV1 during the course of a methacholine challenge (PC20 or PD20FEV1). However, many subjects with allergic rhinitis may have a positive reaction, as evidenced by attaining a PC20 or PD20FEV1, and then demonstrate a plateau. When the PC35FEV1 is used, individuals with this plateau versus individuals with asthma can clearly be differentiated. We thus decided to assess bronchial responsiveness to methacholine with PC20 and PC35FEV1 in asthmatics and patients with allergic rhinitis. Bronchial challenge with methacholine by the method described by Cockcroft et al., with a Hudson 1720 nebulizer (output: 0.198 +/- 0.017 ml/min) was performed on 57 asthmatics and on 56 patients with allergic rhinitis. At the time of the study, they had an FEV1 and FVC greater than or equal to 80% of their predicted normal value and a FEV1FVC% greater than or equal to 70%. Results were expressed as the provocative concentration of methacholine required to produce a 20% and 35% fall in FEV1 (PC20 and PC35FEV1). A plateau was considered if 3 or more consecutive doses of methacholine produced no fall in FEV1 greater than 5%. By the PC20FEV1, bronchial responsiveness was increased (PC20 less than or equal to 18 mg/ml) in 98% of patients with bronchial asthma and in 28% of patients with allergic rhinitis. By the PC35FEV1, bronchial hyperexcitability (PC35FEV1 less than or equal to 40 mg/ml) was detected in 93% of patients with bronchial asthma and in 12% of patients with allergic rhinitis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "ABSTRACT Childhood asthma and outdoor air pollution in Oporto area.The influence of outdoor air pollution, on childhood asthma, is not yet completely understood, especially a long exposition to low but persistent pollutants levels. This paper presents the relationship between air pollution, as sulphur dioxide (SO2) and black smoke (BS), and asthmatic attacks on children living in the Oporto area, during the period between 1983 and 1987, when its levels ranged below the official \"security\" ones. There was no correlation between daily levels of SO2 or BS, and the asthmatic attacks rate. However, for longer periods, as months and quarters, an increased positive correlation was found, but only with SO2 (r = 0.334, p = 0.01; r = 0.473, p = 0.07, for month and quarter periods, respectively). These data suggest that, neither SO2 nor BS seem to be direct bronchospasm inductors, at least when its levels stay between the relatively low limits observed. On the other hand, the longer exposition to SO2 appears to lower the threshold of the asthmatic children to other bronchospasm stimulus.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Current aspects of the therapy of bronchial asthma in childhood].The management goals common to all age groups are to reduce symptoms, to permit a normal physically active lifestyle, and to prevent irreversible airway obstruction. Main measures are environmental manipulation (avoidance of allergen contact, cigarette smoke and pets; psychotherapeutic management), assessment of severity, training for self management, hyposensitization (pollen, HDM, insect venoms) and pharmacotherapy. Medication should be adapted to age and severity of the disease, and the different drugs should be used stepwise. The first step includes the application of bronchodilators in which beta-2-stimulants are to be preferred. If we use spacers or jet nebulizers infants can also be treated successfully. The value of xanthines is discussed controversially. The next steps tend to reduce the inflammatory reaction. In this direction sodium cromoglycate and ketotifen are useful especially in childhood, and inhaled steroids have increasing importance. The use of oral corticosteroids should be the last step.\n",

Multiple corrections of dosage and repeated controls of theophylline concentrations in serum are necessary for empirical adjustment of individual optimal dosage. Pharmacokinetic investigations were made to shorten this management. 12 patients with bronchial asthma, 6 to 18 years of age, received 1.5 to 3 tablets of Aminophyllin under conditions of steady state. Blood samples were taken up to 6 hours after oral application. As a result of statistical analysis we found that the biological half time of theophylline could be determined from 2 to 3 blood samples.

      "ABSTRACT Effects of ozone exposure on experimental asthma in guinea pigs sensitized with ovalbumin through the airway.As ozone (O3) is known to cause airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness, we examined the effects of O3 exposure (1, 3, or 5 ppm, 2 h) on sensitization and provocation in guinea pigs sensitized with ovalbumin (OA) through the airway. In groups exposed to O3 before sensitization, 5 ppm increased the production of IgG1 antibodies and decreased the OA sensitization threshold from 0.01 to 0.002%. In those exposed before provocation, 1, 3, or 5 ppm of O3 decreased the OA provocation threshold from 0.5 to 0.02%, and this enhancement appeared to depend on airway hyperresponsiveness. We conclude that O3 exposure may play an important role in causing asthmatic attacks rather than enhancing allergic sensitization.\n",

      "ABSTRACT PAF-dependent phosphatidylinositol turnover in platelets: differences between asthmatics and normal individuals.The effects of nebulized platelet-activating factor (PAF) on the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems, and on the platelets present in peripheral blood were investigated in 9 normal individuals and in 6 patients with asthma and 3 individuals with lyso-PAF. The inhalation of PAF caused an acute decrease in specific airway conductance. The circulatory system parameters monitored showed an increase in heart rate while blood pressure decreased in both groups that were studied. The inhalation of PAF led to a significant increase in the differential count of polymorphonuclear leukocytes after 15 min; the count returned to the initial level after 24 h. However, the platelet count remained unchanged. The phosphatidylinositol (PI) turnover and in particular the formation of 1,4,5-inositoltrisphosphate (IP3) in platelets were investigated after PAF inhalation. It also mediated an increase in intracellular free calcium concentration, [Ca2+]i, in response to a second challenge with exogenous PAF. The basal levels of IP3 and [Ca2+]i were significantly greater in the platelets of patients with asthma than in those of normal individuals (p less than 0.01). Platelets that had been isolated from normal and asthmatic subjects had a higher concentration of IP3 and [Ca2+]i in the platelets after an in vitro exposure to PAF. After an inhalation challenge with PAF, the platelets of both the normal individuals and the patients with asthma showed a specific refractoriness to the in vitro exposure to PAF. Perhaps, this is an explanation for the PAF-dependent tachyphylaxis that is commonly observed in both normal and asthmatic individuals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

Serum IgE was significantly higher in patients with COPD and BA than in normal subjects (p less than 0.05), and patients with COPD showed serum IgE levels as high as those of patients with BA. However, the skin test scores were significantly higher in patients with BA than in normal subjects and patients with COPD (p less than 0.05).

      "ABSTRACT Continuous methacholine inhalation provocation with resistance monitoring in asthmatic patients.Continuous methacholine inhalation with simultaneous bronchial resistance monitoring was performed in 15 controls and 26 asthmatic patients. The subjects were in quiet tidal breathing, and the airway resistance measured by forced oscillation method were continuously recorded with X-Y recorder. The mean airway resistance of the asthmatic patients was higher than that of the control group, so was the conductance of the asthmatics lower than that of the control. All the asthmatics were responsive to the methacholine test, while only two controls had the response. No correlation could be obtained between bronchial reactivity and sensitivity, but the bronchial sensitivity was correlated with serum total IgE (r = 0.448; p less than 0.05), and suggest that the higher the IgE is, the more sensitive the asthmatic patients respond to methacholine. Continuous methacholine provocation is useful in the diagnosis of bronchial asthma and is more safe and time-saving compared with conventional intermittent method.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Effect of bronchial asthma on growth and physical development].Radiologic bone measurements for determination of the skeletal maturation were conducted in 243 children with bronchial asthma. The authors describe marked retardation of skeletal maturation as a general phenomenon of the atopic asthma. The grade of retardation is greater in atopics than in non-atopic asthmatics. The grade of quantitative response to allergic tests is significantly correlated with the extent of retardation of the skeletal maturation. It is discussed that in addition to asthma, eczema and allergic rhinitis the retardation of the skeletal bone maturation could be a further original manifestation of atopia.\n",

There were no statistical differences between these 2 groups of children with regard to age, sex, serum IgE levels or prevalence of asthma. However, the prevalence of eczema was significantly lower in the infection-prone group (p = 0.035). Of greater interest was the finding that 7 children in the infection-prone group had IgG subclass and/or IgA deficiency compared with none in the non-infection-prone group (p = 0.006). These results suggest that IgG subclass studies may be warranted in children with markedly elevated levels of serum IgE and proneness to infection.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Pollen asthma].In a group of 38 patients with typical symptoms of pollen asthma, 34 pollen allergens were used attempting to determine what kinds of pollen most frequently occurred as causative agents leading to senzibilization in patients from the area of Banija. In subsequent procedure, positivity of cutaneous tests was found to correlate with the blood level of specific IgE (RAST), whereby a high percentage of consistent results was observed. Although polysensibilization is an important problem in the etiological diagnosis of this disease, we are inclined to believe the case history data supported by the results of allergometric tests to be quite sufficient to establish a relation between individual pollens and disease symptoms. Thus, allergologic examinations should involve accurate detection of the largest number of causative agents possible to allow both successful prophylaxis and specific immunologic treatment.\n",

For inhalation through spacer the double blind crossover trial with placebo was used. Out of 12 patients three of them responded with better flows (FEV1, FEF) after inhalation via MDI. In 7 of them there were no significant differences between ways of application while in two of them the flows by spacer were significantly better. Tachypnea, low lung volumes as well as poor co-operation of the patient, especially elderly, should speak in favour of the use of spacer. However, in young, co-operative asthmatic patients the MDI is suitable. Further controlled studies of new applications of inhalation therapy should be studied.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Assessment and prediction of asthma and its severity in the pediatric community.Seventy four asthmatic children aged 7 to 11 years were examined along with controls matched by age and sex. Clinical and laboratory investigations preceded a 28-day follow-up where data about morning and evening peak expiratory flow rate (PEF), symptoms and treatment were recorded. The coefficient of variation of PEF was found to be an objective measurement of asthma severity that has statistically significant correlation with both symptoms (rs = .36) and treatment (rs = .60). Moreover, it separates mild and severe asthmatics, as confirmed by statistically significant differences (p = .008 or less) in symptoms, treatment, skin allergy and airways response to exercise. Skin allergy and airways responsiveness to exercise were found to be predictors of both disease and severity. By means of logistic regression analysis it was possible to establish the probabilities for both asthma and severe asthma when children presenting and not presenting these characteristics are compared. One single positive skin test represent a probability of 88% for the development of asthma and a probability of 70% for severe disease. A PEF reduction of 10% after an exercise test implies a probability of 73% for disease and a probability of 64% for severe disease. Increases in these variables imply geometrically increased risks and their presence together have a multiplicative effect in the final risk.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Duration of protective effect of terbutaline sulfate and cromolyn sodium alone and in combination on exercise-induced asthma.For subjects with EIA participating in physical activities throughout the day, prolonged duration of protection is desirable. The purpose of this study was to determine whether in EIA a combination of the recommended aerosol doses of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor agonist, terbutaline sulfate (0.5 mg), and cromolyn sodium (disodium cromoglycate; 2 mg) provides longer protection against EIA than either drug alone. On four separate days, following the administration of either placebo, terbutaline alone, cromolyn sodium alone or terbutaline and cromolyn sodium together, 12 subjects (seven men and five women; aged 18 to 28 years) with EIA performed four identical eight minute treadmill runs, each separated by two-hour intervals. Drug treatments were given double-blind, with the order counterbalanced using a Latin-square design. Pulmonary function was recorded before the drug, immediately before and after exercise, and at 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 15, and 30 minutes after exercise. Inspired ventilation, heart rate, and environmental conditions were monitored during exercise. A two-way analysis of variance was performed to investigate the main effects of time and drug treatment. Results indicated that in comparison with placebo, EIA was significantly reduced by either cromolyn sodium or terbutaline administered up to two hours (p less than 0.01) and by the combination (cromolyn sodium and terbutaline) up to four hours after inhalation (p less than 0.05). No significant differences were found between the combination and terbutaline during the initial two hours (p less than 0.5). We conclude that a combination of beta 2-adrenergic receptor agonist and cromolyn sodium is the treatment of choice for prolonged effective protection from EIA.\n",

Our results show that (1) increasing I/E ratio or tidal volume-frequency ratio (VT/f) at fixed VE produced small but statistically significant increases (p less than 0.05) in overall heat loss per unit volume of respired gas (RHL/VE) in both asthmatic and nonasthmatic subjects of 1-4 cal/L; (2) changes in breathing pattern alone did not affect bronchoconstrictor response as assessed by lack of change in slopes and intercepts of % delta FEV1 vs. RHL dose-response curves; and (3) the increase in RHL per unit volume of respired gas resulting from increasing VT/f ratios during cold gas hyperpnea was significantly greater in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic subjects. We conclude that changes in breathing pattern may affect overall RHL measured at the mouth, although the maximum effect of such changes in both asthmatic and nonasthmatic subjects is small (10-15%); that such changes do not significantly alter airway constrictor response in asthmatic persons; and (3) that the effects of changing breathing pattern on RHL may be more pronounced in asthmatic than nonasthmatic subjects, which suggests that the asthmatic group may be less able to adapt to factors that alter the magnitude and site of RHL.\n",

Heat-labile neutrophil chemotactic activity (HL NCA) has been investigated only after allergen inhalation challenge. In this study, we have measured HS NCA and HL NCA after exercise of 22 adult patients with asthma, 13 of whom had exercise-induced asthma (EIA). In the 13 patients, the effect of pharmacologic pretreatment on the generation of HS NCA and EIA was evaluated in a double-blind study with inhalation of either disodium cromoglycate, terbutaline, or budesonide 15 minutes before exercise. Additionally, the effect of 4 weeks of treatment with budesonide aerosol was evaluated in an open study. A significant increase (p less than 0.01) in HS NCA was found in the patients with EIA with peak activities 15 minutes after exercise. In patients without EIA, the activity of HS NCA was variable. No HL NCA was detectable after exercise. EIA was inhibited by disodium chromoglycate, terbutaline, and 4 weeks of treatment with budesonide. The generation of HS NCA was more or less inhibited by all three drugs with 4 weeks of treatment with budesonide as the most potent regimen. No late-phase asthmatic reactions to exercise were found. It is concluded that only HS NCA is generated after exercise of subjects with asthma and that this production is controlled by antiasthmatic drugs.

Four days after instillation of ferrimagnetic particles (Fe3O4, 3 mg/kg) into the right lower lobe bronchus, RFS was measured at the body surface immediately after magnetization of the Fe3O4 particles by an externally applied magnetic field. RFS decreased with time because of particle rotation (relaxation). Relaxation is thought to be correlated to CM of AM (J. Appl. Physiol. 55: 1196-1202, 1983). AA inhalation increased respiratory resistance (Rrs) in 10 dogs (responders; P less than 0.01), and did not change Rrs in five dogs (nonresponders; P greater than 0.50). The relaxation rate (lambda 0) significantly decreased because of AA inhalation in responders (P less than 0.01), whereas lambda 0 did not change in nonresponders (P greater than 0.50). Intravenous injection of indomethacin or diclofenac sodium (5 mg/kg) 30 min before AA inhalation completely inhibited the decrease in lambda 0 induced by AA inhalation, although both drugs did not inhibit the increase in Rrs (P greater than 0.10). In in vitro experiments, AM (5 x 10(6) cells) cells) harvested by bronchoalveolar lavage showed a significant dose-dependent decrease in lambda 0 with prostaglandins (PG) E1 and E2. However, histamine and platelet-activating factor increased lambda 0 significantly (P less than 0.01), whereas PGD2, PGF2 alpha, PGI2, thromboxane A2, leukotrienes B4, C4, and D4, and AA itself were without effect (P greater than 0.50). Furthermore, PGE2 aerosols mimicked AA-induced effects on AM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "ABSTRACT Antigen-induced T-cell changes: modulation by pharmacologic agents.To determine the effect of pharmacologic modulation of alterations of peripheral blood T-cell subsets caused by antigen-induced bronchoconstriction, we administered albuterol immediately after antigen-induced bronchoconstriction in a double-blind to protocol to 12 atopic asthmatic subjects. We also administered cromolyn sodium before antigen to 7 of the same subjects. Peripheral blood T-cell subset composition (CD4, CD8, Ia) of a highly purified T-cell preparation was determined before, 24, 48, 72, and 168 h after bronchoconstriction. We found that placebo inhalation immediately after antigen-induced bronchoconstriction did not affect subsequent peripheral blood T-cell subset changes (decrease in CD4+ and increase in Ia+ T lymphocytes). In contrast, inhaled albuterol abolished these T-cell subset changes. Although cromolyn sodium significantly decreased the severity of antigen-induced bronchoconstriction, it did not affect T-cell subset composition changes at the dosage used. We conclude that albuterol can ablate T-cell subset changes associated with antigen-induced bronchoconstriction. Cromolyn sodium ameliorates bronchoconstriction, but has no affect on T-cell subset composition changes. This implies that T-cell changes and bronchoconstriction caused by antigen inhalation are mediated through different pathways.\n",

      "ABSTRACT How much aerosol reaches the lungs of wheezy infants and toddlers?Using sodium cromoglycate as a non-toxic marker, we assessed the delivery of aerosol to nine wheezy infants and seven healthy adults. The drug was delivered to the infants by face mask and spacer device from a metered dose inhaler, and by face mask and nebuliser to the infants and the adults who breathed though their noses. The concentration of sodium cromoglycate was estimated in timed urine collections to find out how much of the dose was absorbed from the lung. Only 0.13% to 0.61% of the 20 mg nominal dose was detected in the urine, representing an estimated 0.3% to 1.5% deposited in the lung. Nasal filtration of aerosol could be a critical factor in reducing lung deposition.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Effect of 4% lidocaine inhalation in bronchial asthma.The effect of 4% lidocaine inhalation was studied in a single-blind fashion in 18 patients with chronic stable asthma. Inhalation of normal saline solution was used as placebo. None of the parameters except flow rate at 50% of vital capacity (V50) showed any statistically significant change from baseline values. V50 at 15 min was significantly lower (p less than 0.05) after 4% lidocaine inhalation. Considering more than 10% change from the baseline value as significant, 8 of 15 patients showed decrease in airway resistance (Raw) and 7 of the 15 patients showed an increase in specific airway conductance (SGaw) after 15 min of inhalation. However, V50 (8/18 patients), flow rate at 25% vital capacity [V25 (6/15 patients], and forced expiratory flow rate at 25-75% of the vital capacity (FEF25-75) (5/15 patients) showed a decrease after 15 min of 4% lidocaine inhalation. No change in pulmonary function was noted after 30 min of lidocaine inhalation. It is concluded from this study that lidocaine produces a small bronchodilatory effect on the large airways and a bronchoconstrictor effect on the small airways after 15 min of inhalation, but this effect is not statistically significant. It can be safely used as topical agent for bronchoscopy in patients with bronchial asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Effects of exercise on gas exchange in patients recovering from acute severe asthma.The effect of exercise on gas exchange was studied in 17 patients (seven male and 10 female) recovering in hospital from acute severe asthma. On admission the patients (mean age 26 (SD 8) years) had a mean peak expiratory flow (PEF) of 26.8% (5.7%) predicted, a mean arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) of 8.63 (1.26) kPa, and a mean alveolar-arterial oxygen difference (A-aDO2) of 5.98 (1.34) kPa. Once resting symptoms had resolved (after 3.7 (1.6) days) patients performed a constant load exercise test (100 watts for men, 75 watts for women) on a bicycle ergometer for five minutes. PEF was measured before exercise and at five minute intervals for 30 minutes after exercise. Blood gas tensions were measured on capillary blood before, during, and 10 minutes after exercise. Treatment was not interrupted for this study. Mean PEF at rest was 87.6% (21.1%) predicted and showed no significant change after exercise. Mean PaO2 was 13.13 (1.37) kPa before exercise; it showed no significant change during exercise (13.93 (1.34) kPa) or 10 minutes after exercise (13.50 (2.15) kPa). Mean A-aDO2 also showed no change, being 1.82 (1.31) kPa before exercise, 1.79 (1.27) kPa during exercise, and 2.53 (0.93) kPa after exercise. It is concluded that moderate exercise carried out shortly after treatment for acute severe asthma is unlikely to result in worsening gas exchange during or after exercise if resting PEF, PaO2 and A-aDO2 have attained normal or near normal values.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Assessment of bronchoalveolar cell and mediator response to isocapnic hyperpnea in asthma.The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that mediators and cells associated with bronchoconstriction or inflammation are locally synthesized and/or released in the airways of asthmatic subjects in response to isocapnic hyperpnea (ISH). Seven atopic, mildly asthmatic subjects were studied. Baseline measurements were reported previously and included forced expiratory volumes, flow rates, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and methacholine reactivity. Approximately 1 yr later, spirometry and BAL were repeated, but BAL was performed immediately after ISH challenge. As indices of inflammation, BAL measurements were made of eosinophils, neutrophils, epithelial cells, leukotrienes B4, C4, D4, and E4, prostaglandins D2, E2, and F2 alpha, thromboxane B2, histamine, and total protein. Compared with baseline, ISH was associated with higher BAL concentrations of the following: leukotriene B4 (10 versus 121 pg/ml, p = 0.02), leukotrienes C4/D4/E4 (46 versus 251 pg/ml, p = 0.02), eosinophils (0.8 versus 2.2%, p = 0.04), and epithelial cells (2.1 versus 6.1%, p = 0.05). Trends toward significant increases were seen in BAL concentrations of neutrophils and prostaglandin D2. No statistically significant increases were found in BAL measurements of total protein, histamine, prostaglandins E2 or F2 alpha, thromboxane B2, lymphocytes, or macrophages. The magnitude of the response to ISH, as measured by change in FEV1, did not correlate with BAL levels of cells or mediators. This study indicates that ISH, even in mildly asthmatic subjects, is associated with airway increases in a spectrum of bronchoactive mediators and inflammatory cells, supporting the observations of others that antagonists of a single mediator are unlikely to have major clinical effectiveness in ISH or exercise-induced asthma.\n",

Twelve children (7.1-15.5 years old) with a history of mild to moderate asthma and EIA performed three maximal exercise tests on a treadmill: 1) test A, without premedication; 2) test B, after premedication with inhaled disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) (40 mg); 3) test C, after premedication with inhaled albuterol (200 micrograms). The energy cost of running was calculated at each minute of exercise. None of the children were limited by dyspnea during the run. The post-exercise fall in FEVi after test A was greater than 20% for each child, the mean fall being 32.8 +/- 11.6%, in comparison with 12.6 +/- 8.9% after test B (P less than 0.001) and 2.5 +/- 5.3% after test C (P less than 0.001). There was no difference in the baseline oxygen uptake for the three tests. Maximum oxygen uptake (VO2 peak) decreased from 43.9 +/- 7.7 mL/min/kg in test A to 37.7 +/- 6.0 mL/min/kg in test B (P less than 0.01) and 39.1 +/- 7.2 mL/min/kg in test C (P less than 0.05). Ventilatory anaerobic threshold in tests B and C was significantly lower than in test A (P less than 0.01).

      "ABSTRACT The cyclooxygenase theory of aspirin-induced asthma.Aspirin-induced asthma is a distinct clinical syndrome which affects about 10% of adult asthmatics. In these patients aspirin and several other analgesics precipitate asthmatic attacks. The idea that the attacks might result from the specific inhibition of a single enzyme, namely cyclooxygenase, has gained both experimental and clinical support. It stimulated a number of hypotheses on the mechanism of bronchoconstriction. All these hypotheses, here discussed, operate within the framework of the cyclooxygenase theory. Their major assumption is that inhibition of cyclooxygenase triggers specific biochemical reactions which lead to open asthma attacks.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Aspirin--relieved asthma.It is widely known that there might occur three different responses to the administration of ASA or NSAID to patients with bronchial asthma-bronchoconstriction, bronchodilatation or lack of bronchopulmonary action. Nevertheless, the beneficial effect of SAID has been confirmed in patients who are both nonallergic and cortico-dependent asthmatics. Our hypothesis is that in these specific cases the arachidonic acid metabolism is diverted towards cyclo-oxygenase products and that this metabolic diversion leads to an increased production of bronchoconstriction prostaglandins. The administration of NSAID inhibits the cyclo-oxygenase suppressing the enhanced basal production of these bronchoconstrictors and relieving the bronchospasm. The suspected abnormality in arachidonic acid metabolism would be restricted to the respiratory system.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Is filariasis a trigger for bronchial asthma?Many Sri Lankan children with cough and wheeze and peripheral blood eosinophilia are treated with diethyl carbamazine (D.E.C.) on the assumption that filaria is the cause. We tried to establish whether filaria can trigger asthma and whether D.E.C. improves bronchial reactivity. In 35 symptomatic and 22 asymptomatic children peripheral blood eosinophil counts, filarial antibody test, stool examination, chest radiography, allergy skin tests and histamine inhalation tests were performed before and after treatment with D.E.C. Most of the symptomatic children were atopic; 1/3 of all children had helminthiasis, positive filarial antibodies and total eosinophil counts of greater than 2,000. Ten children had chest radiographs suggestive of tropical pulmonary eosinophilia. Only in those with intermittent symptoms was there a marked improvement in bronchial reactivity after D.E.C., but baseline peak expiratory flow (P.E.F.) improved in all symptomatic groups. We conclude that 1/3 of the children had filariasis which in an atopic individual may trigger asthma. Both the anti-inflammatory and the anti-filarial action of D.E.C. probably contribute to improvement of bronchial reactivity.\n",

A prospective study of 2,000 Thai asthmatic children showed boys to be more frequently affected than girls, and fifty percent of patients experienced their first attack within the first 2 years of life. Attacks usually occurred in winter and the rainy season. 63.15% of patients had asthma associated with other allergic diseases and 79.25% had a family history of allergic diseases. Positive skin tests to important antigens were noted in 93.7% of cases, and house dust was the most common. Pharmacokinetic studies of theophylline were made in Thai asthmatic children after oral administration revealed that the elimination half-life of theophylline was longer than that observed in subjects in Western countries. Long-term follow up of 247 Thai asthmatic children revealed that in 37.2% of patients, symptoms ceased at the age of 15 years. The factors which indicated a favorable prognosis included male sex, mild or moderate illness, negative skin tests or positive skin tests to only a few allergens.\n",

Twelve children with stable chronic asthma were enrolled in a physical conditioning program to improve ventilation mechanics and to promote physical activity. The program consisted of eight weekly sessions of one-and-a-half hours each, followed by three months of weekly swimming lessons. The activities were preceded by a warm-up period and interspersed with rest. Premedication with an aerosol bronchodilator or sodium cromoglycate was allowed before training. Cardiorespiratory status was studied before and after the program. The program was well received by the children with no bronchospasm. Five showed improvement in lung volumes and/or flow rates. Bronchial liability remained the same. The basal heart rate slowed in four children. No significant arrhythmia was detected. With continued practice, cardiorespiratory function might improve further.

      "ABSTRACT Prophylaxis in childhood asthma.Opinions on the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma have changed considerably in recent years. An immunologic mechanism to explain the state of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in asthmatic patients was not widely accepted in the past. However, with increasing knowledge of immunologic, biochemical and neurogenic mechanisms, a better understanding of the pathophysiology of asthma has evolved. This has encouraged investigators to develop new drugs to control asthmatic symptoms. The treatment of asthma consists of measures to control acute attacks and to prevent recurrences. We try to present in this paper a comprehensive review of asthma prophylaxis in children. This includes environmental control, parent/patient education, physiotherapy/psychotherapy, allergy extract immunotherapy and drug prophylaxis. The pharmacologic actions, advantages and disadvantages of drugs used for prophylaxis are discussed. A double-blind investigation on the safety and efficacy of Ketotifen among Filipino asthmatic patients demonstrated beneficial results compared with other countries. An algorithm of the use of various drugs in the prophylaxis of childhood asthma is presented.\n",

We also made a prospective study to see whether early elimination of the allergen has any beneficial effect on the cessation of the development of allergic diathesis thereafter. Our study suggested that early elimination of food allergen in infancy not only improved clinical manifestations but also had a protective effect on the progression of the allergic march so far as production of reaginic antibodies was concerned: production of total IgE and mite specific IgE was kept to a minimum.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Urinary arginine vasopressin in asthma: consideration of fluid therapy.To elucidate the role of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) on water and electrolyte balance in patients with asthmatic attacks, urinary arginine vasopressin (AVP) was assayed in 28 asthmatic patients. In a 3-year-old girl with status asthmaticus who developed a grand mal seizure in association with hyponatremia, urinary AVP levels remained high and fluctuated before convulsion; the cause of the convulsion was considered to be water intoxication due to inappropriate ADH secretion. In 19 of 28 patients with moderately severe asthmatic attacks, increases in urinary AVP levels occurred before treatment (300 +/- 80 pg/ml vs. 40 +/- 24 pg/ml (normal controls), p less than 0.01); elevated AVP levels tended to fall in response to intravenous fluid therapy (appropriate ADH secretion) in 2 of 6 patients, but did not fall (inappropriate ADH secretion) in the remaining patients. It is concluded that inappropriate ADH secretion may occur in asthmatic attacks, and that in such a condition there seems to be a potential risk of water intoxication during fluid therapy, as demonstrated in the present patient.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Death from asthma in children.We have recorded 29 cases of death from asthma in children who had visited the Department of Pediatrics of Doai Memorial Hospital between 1965 and 1987. These cases have been analyzed. They were 18 males and 11 females. The mean age at death was 12.4 years and we found that in later childhood and adolescence the age at death had been increasing since 1973. The duration from final attack to death was very short: less than 1 hour: 21% and less than 2 hours: 50%. About half of the cases could not reach the hospital. Ten cases died within one year after cessation of long-term systemic use of steroid. Severe attacks of asthma were particularly likely to occur during the reducing period or following cessation of these drugs. The importance of adequate and vigorous initial therapy in severe asthmatic attacks should be emphasized. The causes of death are as follows: asphyxia: 23 cases (one complicated by aspiration, one withdrawal syndrome of steroid, one subendocardial haemorrhage and two pneumothorax cases), anaphylactic shock to ACTH: 1 case, shock to stimulant: 1 case, following emergency operation: 1 case and unknown: 3 cases.

      "ABSTRACT Treatment of status asthmaticus--hormone changes before and after aminophylline i.v. drip therapy.The treatment of status asthmaticus is one of the most important factors in controlling the patient with asthma attacks. We have studied hormone changes in status asthmaticus and considered what is the best treatment in the asthma attack condition in children. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH), renin activity, and aldosterone activity are elevated in severe asthma attack conditions, and these high levels are correlated with high levels in Wood's clinical score. It is theoretical that patients with dehydration and respiratory failure show such elevation in hormones, and it is well known that under such conditions beta 2-stimulant enhances renin production. From our study, it is concluded that beta 2-stimulant subcutaneous injection must be considered in status asthmaticus. In children, aminophylline i.v. drip therapy may be one of the best treatments in status asthmaticus.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Benefits and problems of a physical training programme for asthmatic patients.The clinical and physiological effects of a medically supervised, indoor physical training programme were investigated in 36 asthmatic subjects aged 16-40 years. After clinical evaluation, lung function assessment, and progressive incremental exercise testing subjects were randomly allocated to control and training groups. The measurements were repeated after a six week run in period and after a further three months in which those in the training group underwent an indoor training programme. The measurements made at three months were compared with those at the end of the run in period. There was no significant change in anthropometric characteristics, blood lipid profiles, or the provocative concentration of histamine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (histamine PC20) in the group who underwent training. After training there were significant increases in mean maximal oxygen uptake (ml kg-1 min-1) from 23 (5) to 28 (6), oxygen pulse (ml/beat) from 8.8 (2.3) to 10.8 (2.4), and anaerobic threshold (1/min) from 1.11 (0.27) to 1.38 (0.33). These changes were significantly greater in the group undergoing training than in the control group. There was also a significant fall in breathlessness scores (Borg ratings), blood lactate, carbon dioxide output, and minute ventilation during submaximal exercise in the training group, with no change in the control group. The subject's motivation, the initial level of fitness, and the symptom score at the time of training were the most important factors influencing improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness. Thus submaximal physical exercise of controlled intensity, sustained for three months, produced significant improvements in fitness and cardiorespiratory performance that should be advantageous to the exercising asthmatic patient. The availability of medical supervision throughout the exercise programme appears to have contributed to the successful outcome.\n",

The treatment of asthma in children should reduce their symptoms. Although asthma medication appears to be efficient in clinical trials such is not the case in clinical practice and public health. The use of drugs and services depends upon the severity of the disease as well as upon cultural, personal and familial factors. These factors are crucial in the spontaneously inconsistent evolution of this disease. The management of asthmatic children should thus aim: 1) to alter behaviors--of both the patients and their parents who are often in charge of the treatment on a day-to-day basis and of the physician in order to organize a comprehensive therapeutic project for the sick children; 2) to enhance the collaboration between the different paramedical people involved in the treatment; 3) to improve the efficiency of the health system to allow it to achieve its goal of providing high-standard, accessible health care.\n",

Bronchial hyperresponsiveness is regarded as a major characteristic of bronchial asthma and is partly acquired during life as a result of a permanent airway irritation to inhaled allergens. We investigated 704 schoolchildren of two different climate areas for existing bronchial hyperreactivity (cumulative carbachol test) and sensitization to ten common aeroallergens (by skin prick test). Additional information on residential factors, passive smoking, and clinical symptoms for asthma was obtained by a standardized interview and compared with the clinical results. Among 35 of 704 children who were considered as asthmatics, 83% demonstrated a sensitization to one or more allergens. On the contrary, only one third of the nonasthmatic population (n = 669) showed sensitization in the skin test. The relative risk for allergy in children with bronchial hyperreactivity was increased (odds ratio 3.0).

      "ABSTRACT The progressive nature of childhood asthma.Asthma is the most common chronic disease in childhood. It has been repeatedly stated that childhood asthma is a self-limiting disorder, but this is a misleading and often inaccurate generalization. Prospective studies have demonstrated that many patients who had seemingly outgrown their disease experienced symptoms again as they grew older. In addition, recent evidence suggests that, despite the lack of clinical manifestation of asthma, there is a persistence of bronchial hyperreactivity for several years. A number of epidemiologic studies have identified factors that seem to be associated with the persistence of asthma into later childhood or adult life. Information about the effects of treatment of asthma on the natural history of the disease is vital. While treatment greatly reduces the morbidity from asthma, it is not known whether early recognition and aggressive treatment of the disease have any influence on the outcome of the disease later in life.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Determinants and regulating processes in bronchial hyperreactivity.Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) can be considered as a feature of asthma, although only a loose relationship is present with symptoms and severity of the disease. Epidemiology of BHR may inform about determining factors in BHR and its role as a risk factor. BHR is found already at a young age, mostly diminishes with age, and increases in many asthmatic patients after midlife. Genetic determinants are suggested by familial segregation and twin studies. Allergy, respiratory infections, and cigarette smoking are found to induce increase in BHR and to modify its degree at the long run. The mechanisms in BHR are being unraveled gradually. A chronic inflammation with an important role for eosinophils, mast cells, and others, is thought to modify bronchial mechanisms, such as smooth muscle, epithelium, and autonomic systems. Growing evidence supports that T lymphocytes are implicated and may determine many of the inflammatory cells, such as eosinophils, neutrophils, and mast cells.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Nonpharmacologic means of preventing asthma.Cessation of smoking in the home is one of the most important nonpharmacologic actions to be recommended. There is a highly significant increase in wheezing, coughing, and respiratory infections in children with smoking mothers, and this increase is directly proportional to the number of cigarettes smoked. Cord blood IgE levels are increased in babies whose mothers smoke during pregnancy. Other agents, such as sulpur dioxide and chemical pollutants from industrial processes may play a role in the development or exacerbation, of asthma symptoms and should be avoided. One of the most interesting areas in food allergy is whether breast feeding causes sensitization or induces tolerance in infants to foods ingested by the mother. There is an increase in asthma in second-generation immigrant populations who are exposed, from birth, to the Western style of living which increases their exposure to house dust mite. Several studies have shown that month of birth is important in the development of specific allergies, for example, in the incidence of birch pollen allergy in Scandinavia. The presence of a pet in the home at birth is associated with a greater incidence of allergy to that animal. Our study in asthmatic children has shown a strong association (p less than 0.001) between the presence of allergens in the air in their homes (sampled retrospectively in the month of birth) with a positive skin test to those allergens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "ABSTRACT Passive smoking in childhood--tobacco smoke.Prevalence of cigarette smoking varies widely in different countries, ranging, at the age of 13, from 2% to 5% (Sweden, United States) to more than 30% (Australia, Uruguay). Even if the prevalence of smokers among male adolescents is decreasing in western countries, it is increasing among girls and, in developing countries, male adolescent smokers still reach 40% (and up to 70%-80%). The determination of saliva cotinine levels, a product of nicotine metabolism, is an useful indicator of exposure to passive or active smoking. In a study of 210 children aged 9-13 years, we found detectable levels of saliva cotinine in 13% of children who lived in nonsmoking families and denied being regular smokers and in only 60% of children living in families with heavy cigarette consumption. This wide variations of a marker of smoking exposure may explain the differences in reported consequences of tobacco smoke in investigations conducted in different places and on different target populations. We later studied the effects of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) in a sample of 166 nine-year-old children. The relationship between parental smoking and degree of bronchial responsiveness in males was significant. Also, prick skin test reactivity to allergens was significantly increased in children of smoking parents. Many studies concerning the effects of ETS exposure seem to demonstrate that not only the lungs and not only children are affected even if the difficulty of the epidemiology in such a field must suggest caution in interpreting the results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "ABSTRACT Airways and air pollution in childhood: state of the art.Correlations between ambient pollutants and health effects, such as observed in SIDS, may in reality be to a larger extent the result of indoor sources. These distinctions between indoor and outdoor sources, while important, do not detract from the overall conclusion that pollution affects the airway in children directly and indirectly. Much still needs to be learned about the permanence of these effects, the mechanism by which the effect is mediated, and the conditions under which some of these effects are maximal. Two approaches seem particularly suited to shed further light on these issues. First, identification of biological markers for exposure to pollutants will yield both more accurate measures of exposure to pollutants and information about health consequences. Second, newer modeling techniques promise to predict health outcomes under a variety of environmental conditions. Shumway et al., for instance, describe a promising model predicting an increase in mortality due to ambient pollutants in the Los Angeles Basin with higher levels under extremes of temperature, especially during cold spells. Time series and factor analyses may further our knowledge as well. In the near future, large cohort studies should begin to reveal the cumulative effects of air pollution on the respiratory system, especially in relation to active smoking. Finally, studies in Black children are virtually unavailable. Given their high risk for respiratory illnesses, such studies are sorely needed.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Acute viral bronchiolitis in infancy: epidemiology and management.Acute bronchiolitis due to viral agents (RSV, parainfluenza, influenza, adenovirus) is a relatively frequent disease of infancy. Seasonal epidemic pattern have been recognized, and nosocomial infections in pediatric wards occur. Until age 2 years most children have experienced some form of airway disease attributable to RSV. Some patients require hospital treatment; about 15% of our patients had to be transferred to the intensive care unit. Bronchiolitis seems to be frequently the first manifestation of asthma and we found higher IgG antibody titers to viruses causing bronchiolitis in children with asthma than in controls. Retrospective analysis of the charts of 147 cases of bronchiolitis revealed considerable uncertainty regarding therapeutic concepts. Mainstays of conservative therapy include oxygen, adequate hydration (often IV), and sometimes bronchodilators (based on the clinical impression of effectiveness in the individual patient). Mist therapy and secretolytic agents remain popular, although no clinical effect has been demonstrated. Attention should be directed toward the relief of upper airway obstruction caused by swelling, secretions, and nasogastric tubes. Oxygen administration in infants with coexisting chronic airway disease (e.g., BPD) and bronchiolitis may cause CO2 retention. Bronchodilators can cause hypoxia and increase bronchial compressibility by reducing smooth muscle tone. However, in severe cases a trial under pulse oximetry control seems worthwhile. Steroids seem to bring no clinical improvement, except in infants with protracted wheezing after bronchiolitis and patients with preexisting BPD.\n",

Therefore, to effectively manage asthma, structured education programs for adult asthmatics appear to be useful including information about the disease and the medication as well as training of self-management of airflow limitation by the patients.

It can be stimulated by a number of stimuli among which PAF appears to be one of the most effective. The eosinophil is a source for a variety of proinflammatory and toxic products with profound effect in the lungs and airways. These eosinophil products mimic some of the features of asthma and the strong association of the eosinophil with asthma has led to the suggestion that asthma would be better classified as \"chronic desquamating eosinophilic bronchitis.\" Although the evidence known to date is persuasive many questions still remain unanswered and await further investigation.

The majority of these variants are of no clinical significance. Epidemiologically, the most abundant are Pi types M, S, and Z. Homozygotes of type Z have only 10%-20% of the normal serum concentration of the inhibitor and have an increased risk of developing pulmonary emphysema. Cigarette smoking is the most important risk factor. A minority of Pi Z homozygotes (10%-20%) develop a form of neonatal hepatitis and a proportion of these suffer from liver cirrhosis in adult life. Heterozygotes of Pi type SZ have about one third of the normal serum alpha 1-protease inhibitor concentration but this phenotype does not in itself appear to be a significant emphysema risk factor. Heterozygotes of Pi type MZ are thought to have a moderately increased risk of developing emphysema but only if they smoke; there is also evidence for an increased risk of cirrhosis among subjects of type MZ. No excessive risk appears to be attached to the MS phenotype. Cumulative survival curves have suggested that type Z homozygotes have a poor prognosis but such estimates are based on clinic or hospital patients who already have respiratory symptoms. Calculations based on population frequencies however, suggest that about 90% of the total number of type Z subjects are not accounted for in such surveys. Their whereabouts remains unclear at present; some will undoubtedly have died of liver or lung disease but it is possible that the majority escape and live undetected among the general population.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Postural mechanisms in asthma: importance for nocturnal symptoms.The supine position impairs ventilatory function in patients with ongoing asthma. The response is dual: an immediate decrease on lying down, present in healthy persons as well, and a progressive decrease specific for asthmatics. The changes are counteracted by bronchodilators, but are not linked to a decreased plasma adrenaline level when supine. The progressive decrease is tentatively explained by an increased vagal tone induced by the resting body position, and is likely to be a key factor in nocturnal asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Gas exchange abnormalities in asthma.There has been considerable interest over the last years in gas exchange abnormalities that occur in patients with bronchial asthma, particularly during an acute attack. These are essentially characterized by moderate to severe hypoxemia and hypocapnia caused by considerable ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) mismatch. Using the multiple inert gas elimination technique, the baseline pattern of VA/Q distribution reveals a bimodal bloodflow distribution of VA/Q ratios but no shunt. Inhaled salbutamol seems to be an efficient and safe therapeutic approach, owing to the lack of deleterious effect on VA/Q inequality. Following intravenous salbutamol there is development of further VA/Q mismatch for the same degree of bronchodilation, the resulting deleterious effect on PaO2 being offset by the improvement in mixed venous PO2 due to increased cardiac output.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Management of asthma and chronic airflow limitation: are methylxanthines obsolete?The widespread popularity of methylxanthine derivatives should be reassessed in light of current evidence. These drugs are relatively weak bronchodilators, respiratory muscle stimulants and inotropic agents and adverse effects, sometimes life threatening, occur fairly frequently. In contrast, beta-2 adrenergic and anticholinergic bronchodilator aerosols used in asthma or chronic obstructive lung disease, and the prophylactic anti-inflammatory aerosols of corticosteroids and cromolyn provide a spectrum of therapeutic choices which address both the inflammatory and bronchoconstrictor components of acute and chronic airflow limitation. Aerosol bronchodilators, in general, are more potent, are virtually free of important side effects, and do not require costly serum level monitoring. Adrenoceptor agonists, together with inhaled steroids, should be considered first-line drugs of choice in managing patients with reversible airflow obstruction associated with asthma or COPD, while methylxanthines should be relegated to the position of third or fourth line drugs, if they are to be used at all. If they are, they should be used with great caution and close patient supervision and, even then, only if benefit, over and above the aerosol bronchodilators and inhaled anti-inflammatory agents can be demonstrated objectively.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Use of different inhalation devices in children.Many studies in which patient's inhaler use technique has been studied have shown that one of the major problems patients have, in using an inhaler correctly, is that of poor coordination of inhaler actuation with inspiration. We have studied a new breath-actuated inhaler (\"Autohaler\" 3M Riker) which is designed to ensure correct coordination automatically. This study involves 100 children (aged 3-10 years) and includes both normal children and asthmatic patients. None of these children have previous experience using any type of inhaler. Each child is taught to use the \"Autohaler\" containing a placebo only. A video film is employed in order to standardize the teaching technique. Once the child is able to operate the new inhaler correctly, he or she inspires through an \"Autohaler\" unit specially modified so that the inspiratory flow rate and the volume of air inhaled is measured by a pneumotachograph in series with the inhaler. The time point, within the inspiratory cycle, at which the inhaler is triggered is also recorded. The majority of children older than 7 years were able to use the \"Autohaler\" after a few minutes instruction. Therefore, this is a valuable alternative in this age group.\n",

Modulation by betamethasone, phenidone, indomethacin, WEB 2086, and a novel antiallergy agent, SCH 37224.Eosinophil infiltration into bronchoalveolar areas of the lung has been assessed in guinea pigs sensitized to ovalbumin (OA) and then challenged with the aerosolized antigen. Cell content, histamine, and guinea pig albumin (GPA) have been measured in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from these animals. Extensive eosinophil accumulation resulted from sensitization followed by OA challenge; monocytes that initially accounted for greater than 80% of the BAL cells remained essentially constant, and neutrophils comprised less than 3% of the population throughout. Eosinophils were elevated at 3 h, peaked with a fivefold increase at 24 h, and remained elevated for at least 7 days. Histopathologic changes observed in lungs taken from sensitized guinea pigs 24 h after OA challenge confirm this eosinophilia. Increased histamine and GPA were detected only at 5 min. Oral treatment with betamethasone (ED50 = 0.4 mg/kg), phenidone (ED50 = 15 mg/kg), Sch 37224 (ED50 = 0.5 mg/kg), and WEB 2086 (ED50 = 4 mg/kg) decreased eosinophil accumulation in the BAL fluid, indicating roles for 5-lipoxygenase products and PAF in this multimediator-dependent model of allergic inflammation. On the other hand, 4 mg/kg of indomethacin increased total cells with no effect on eosinophils, precluding a major role for cyclooxygenase products. Sch 37224, an antileukotriene agent and an orally active novel antiallergy agent in sheep, guinea pigs, and humans, is as potent as betamethasone at blocking eosinophil infiltration, suggesting that it may also suppress human pulmonary inflammation.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Acid-base disturbances in acute asthma.The clinical features, arterial blood gases, and acid-base profile were examined in 229 consecutive episodes of acute asthma in 170 patients who required hospitalization. A simple respiratory alkalosis was the most common acid-base disturbance, occurring in 48 percent of the episodes. Metabolic acidosis, either alone or as part of a mixed disturbance, was noted in 28 percent. Of 60 episodes presenting with respiratory acidosis, 37 (62 percent) had a coexistent metabolic acidosis. Metabolic acidosis was more likely to occur in male subjects and in patients with evidence of more severe airflow obstruction. Patients with metabolic acidosis had an average anion gap of 15.8 mEq/L; these patients were more hypoxemic than those without metabolic acidosis and there was a significant inverse correlation between the anion gap and the degree of hypoxemia. We conclude that metabolic acidosis is a common finding in acute, severe asthma and suggest that the pathogenesis of lactic acidosis is multifactorial and includes contributions from lactate production by respiratory muscles, tissue hypoxia, and intracellular alkalosis.\n",

All patients experienced a rapid reduction in airway pressures, CO2 retention, and resolution of acidosis while breathing a helium-oxygen mixture. There were no untoward effects. Helium-oxygen mixtures improve ventilation by reducing the Reynolds number and reducing density dependent resistance. Helium's beneficial effects are due to its high kinematic viscosity, high binary diffusion coefficient for CO2, and high diffusivity. Helium-oxygen mixtures should be considered for use in mechanically ventilated asthmatics with respiratory acidosis who fail conventional therapy.\n",

Forty healthy subjects, 90 patients with bronchial asthma, 20 with chronic bronchitis, 2 with sarcoidosis, 14 with pollenosis, one with mucoviscidosis and 22 with dispnoa or long-lasting dry cough were tested. The total of 149 provocations have been carried out in patients and 40 in healthy subjects. Airways resistance after provocation with cold dry air and eucapnic hyperventilation in patients with bronchial asthma is increased over 100% in 13 (14%), over 200% in 12 (13%), over 300% in 25 (26%) and over 500% in 40 (47%) patients. Less intensive asthmatic attack was provoked in 14 (15%), moderate attack in 18 (20%) and severe attack in 58 (65%) patients with asthma. Provocation time lasted from 2 to 9.9 min. Inspired air temperature ranged from -23 degrees C to -26 degrees C. Airway resistance was measured before and after provocation by means of Bronchoscreen. Central airway resistance was increased in 2 patients, peripheral resistance in 78, and both resistances in 10 patients with bronchial asthma. The results pointed out that provocation with cold dry air and eucapnic hyperventilation resulted in bronchial hyperreactivity exclusively in patients with bronchial asthma, and the test was positive in 100% of patients with bronchial asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The time course of bronchoconstriction in asthmatics during and after isocapnic hyperventilation.We studied the effect of changing the duration of isocapnic hyperventilation on the time course of bronchoconstriction in five subjects with asthma. Each subject performed hyperventilation challenges of 4, 8, and 16 min. No significant bronchoconstriction occurred until the hyperventilation was stopped, regardless of its duration. We found increased bronchoconstriction as the duration of hyperventilation increased. The declines in FEV1 (mean +/- SD) from baseline were 13 +/- 10%, 22 +/- 7%, and 29 +/- 12% for 4, 8, and 16 min of hyperventilation, respectively (1 versus 3, p less than 0.01). Mean times after hyperventilation until maximal bronchoconstriction were 12 +/- 4 min, 9 +/- 6 min, and 6 +/- 4 min. We also found slight bronchodilation during the first 4 min of hyperventilation. After 2 and 4 min of hyperventilation, the FEV1 was 103 +/- 5% and 103 +/- 3% of baseline, respectively (both p less than 0.05, compared to baseline). We conclude that increasing the duration of hyperventilation delays the onset of bronchoconstriction but causes greater bronchoconstriction once the hyperventilation is stopped. These results suggest that either hyperventilation itself inhibits bronchoconstriction or that the mechanisms that induce bronchoconstriction in response to hyperventilation operate after, rather than during, hyperventilation.\n",

      "ABSTRACT 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid is the major arachidonic acid metabolite in human bronchi: association with airway epithelium.15(S)-Hydroxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) was by far the most abundant metabolite of arachidonic acid in chopped human bronchi, as identified by reverse phase HPLC, uv spectrometry, and GC/MS. The quantitation of monohydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (mono-HETEs) was performed by the use of 16(S)-hydroxy-9(Z),12(Z),14(E)-heneicosatrienoic acid as internal standard. Thus, significant amounts of 15-HETE were obtained in incubations of bronchi in buffer alone, but the addition of exogenous arachidonic acid (3-100 microM), dose-dependently increased the formation, with maximal levels reached at around 10 min. In contrast, challenge with ionophore A23187 or anti-human IgE did not stimulate the production of 15-HETE in the bronchi. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid inhibited the production of 15-HETE, whereas indomethacin did not. Small amounts of 8,15-diHETEs were detected in incubations with exogenous 15H(P)ETE. Lipoxins were however not detected under any of the incubation conditions used. Furthermore, removal of the airway epithelium substantially diminished the production of 15-HETE in the bronchi. Finally, bronchi were obtained from three patients with asthma, and the amounts of 15-HETE in these specimens were significantly higher than those found in tissues from nonasthmatics. Also, in peripheral lung parenchyma and pulmonary blood vessels 15-HETE was the major mono-HETE after stimulation with arachidonic acid but the levels were about 10 times lower than in the bronchi. As another difference, challenge of the parenchyma with the ionophore A23187 made 5-HETE the predominant mono-HETE. Taken together, airway epithelium appears to be the major source of 15-HETE in the human lung and the findings in specimens of asthmatics raise the possibility that 15-HETE somehow is involved in airway inflammation.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Respiration of patients with chronic lung disease at 500 and 1500 meter above sea level].There is plentiful literature on respiration at high altitude (3000-8000 m above sea level) and its cardiopulmonary sequelae. But little is known about changes in ventilation and in pulmonary gas exchange at altitudes of 1,000-2,000 m above sea level. We studied 68 patients 500 and 1,500 m above sea level. On the arrival of the patients at 534 m above sea level we measured the arterial blood gases, pulse rate, respiratory rate and a breathing score. The same measurements were repeated on arrival at 1,500 m above sea level. A lung function test (FEV1, FVC, PEF, MEF 25-75) was also performed. The patients were divided into three groups: asthmatics, chronic bronchitics and restrictive patients. A control group was formed of patients without lung disease. Within all groups, the pO2 and the pCO2 diminishes significantly, no significant difference between the groups was found. In patients with lung disease oxygen saturation changes from 94.1% to 91.8% (COPD) and from 95.3% to 93.4% (restrictive patients). Age, smoking habits, lung function test and blood gases at 534 m are not predictors of the blood gases at altitude in COPD patients. But patients with restrictive lung disease show a positive correlation between age and change in pO2, as well as between severity of the restrictive disease and the change in oxygen saturation. The change of pO2 in COPD patients is not relevant clinically, as there is only minimal change in oxygen saturation. We conclude that patients of all degrees of COPD and patients with light to moderate restrictive lung disease can safely tolerate a difference in altitude from 534 to 1,500 m.\n",

A number of clinical studies have attempted to clarify the effect of pregnancy on the course of asthma. Taken together, there is little consistent evidence that pregnancy profoundly influences the severity of asthma, except in occasional individuals. The goals of therapy in managing asthma in a pregnant women are identical to those in a nonpregnant woman with asthma. Management of pregnant women with asthma aims at preventing recurrent attacks of wheezing, acute severe asthmatic attacks, and respiratory failure. Recent studies suggest that inflammation in the airway walls may play an important role in the pathogenesis of asthma. It is increasingly apparent that several different cells, particularly eosinophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, produce a variety of mediators that interact in a complex way to produce a number of pathologic effects. Therefore, the primary treatment should involve antiinflammatory drugs. At present, inhaled corticosteroids appear to be the most effective therapy. Cromolyn sodium may also have an antiinflammatory effect. On the other hand, beta 2-sympathomimetics are the most effective bronchodilators available, followed by theophylline. None of these anti-asthma drugs is harmful in usual doses, to either woman or fetus.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Clinical effects of theophylline in the therapy of intractable asthmatic children. II. Theophylline therapy and behavior problems in children with asthma].This study examined the relationship between long-term theophylline therapy and behavior problems in 14 asthmatic children that includes 5 intractable cases and 24 non-asthmatic children. Asthmatic children have received theophylline therapy and cromolyn inhalation for 3.6 +/- 3.8 years. Subjects were tested on neuropsychologic batteries; behavior problems and personality of children questionnaire, child behavior checklist, caffeine-like side effects questionnaire, manifest anxiety scale, visual attention test, Uchida-Kraepelin test and soft neurological signs. These tests were repeated with an interval of 1 to 12 weeks. Parents noted caffeine-like side effects, stomach ache and difficulty in sleeping, in their child during the theophylline therapy. The caffeine-like side effects decreased after stopping theophylline therapy. The rate of mistake in Uchida-Kraepelin test for the asthmatic group and for the intractable cases was significantly higher than that of the control group. Time of the sequential finger thumb opposition of the soft neurological signs was significantly prolonged in asthmatic group. There was no significant change in the other tests between asthmatic and non-asthmatic children and before and after stopping theophylline therapy. It seems that behavior problems and learning disability observed in the asthmatic children are due to the pathogenesis or symptoms of asthma rather than the effect of long-term theophylline therapy.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Enhanced arachidonic acid metabolism and human neutrophil migration in asthma.In stable state asthmatic patients (AP) without any airway obstruction, the capacity of peripheral blood polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) to produce 5-lipoxygenase metabolites and to migrate, was investigated and compared with the response in healthy subjects (HS). After calcium-ionophore A23187 stimulation, PMN from AP and HS produced LTB4, its hydroxylated derivatives: omega-OH-and omega-CO2H-LTB4) (omega-LTB4, i.e 6-trans-LTB4 and 5,6-diHETE isomers, and 5-HETE. We found an increase in LTB4 (+59%), omega-LTB4 (+39%), 6-trans-LTB4 (+128%), and free 5-HETE (+63%) generation of AP as compared with HS. Unstimulated migration was enhanced in AP (122 +/- 27 PMN/10 high power fields (hpf) in AP versus 74 +/- 25 PMN/10 hpf in HS, p less than 0.025) and suggested a greater capacity of PMN from AP to migrate. This was confirmed by the PAF-induced chemotaxis studies which showed, in AP, a greater PAF-sensitivity of PMN (10(-6) M versus 10(-5) M in HS) and a greater chemotaxis response (600 +/- 50 PMN versus 200 +/- 35 PMN in HS). In AP, we compared the capacity of PMN to generate LTB4 and 5-HETE with their capacity to migrate. We found an inverse correlation (r = 0.86, p less than 0.007) of intracellular free 5-HETE with chemotaxis to PAF.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Aberrant expression of HLA-DR antigens of the MHC class II in bronchial epithelial cells in asthmatic patients].The study of cellular events in the bronchi of asthmatic patients shows significant epithelial destruction. The ciliated cells are more often destroyed than others in the respiratory epithelium. Using highly specific monoclonal antibodies, we detected that the epithelial cells were positive for HLA-DR antigen expression, whereas those from healthy subjects were negative. The aberrant expression could be explained by the presence of T lymphocytes in the asthmatic bronchial mucosa. The activated lymphocytes (CD4+) are known to release gamma interferon, which is a lymphokine that induces or enhances the expression of HLA-DR antigens. These cells, which are known to mediate cytotoxicity in an Ag-specific and Ia-restricted way, could take part in the shedding process of epithelial cells in asthma.\n",

The airway caliber change induced immediately following a deep inhalation (DI) appears to relate to the mechanism (inflammation vs. smooth muscle constriction) and site (peripheral vs. more central) of obstruction and the degree of hyperresponsiveness. Data are presented and reviewed that support the notion that relative hysteresis of parenchyma (including peripheral airways and alveolar ducts) and airways (more centrally located, conducting airways) can explain the magnitude and sign of airway caliber change that follow a DI in asthmatic subjects.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Cold air challenge for measuring airway reactivity in children: lack of a late asthmatic reaction.Cold air challenge (CACh) for measuring airway reactivity uses respiratory heat or water loss as a bronchoconstrictor stimulus; this stimulus is also important for the development of exercise-induced asthma, for which late asthmatic reactions (LARs) have been described. At 1200 hr on day 1, 22 children with asthma started to record their peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) in 3 hr intervals until 0900 hr on day 2. At 1000 hr, they underwent a standardized 4 min CACh. Children then inhaled salbutamol and continued to record PEFR until 0900 hr on day 3. As a bronchodilator effect, PEFR measurements were significantly higher 2, 5, and 8 hr after CACh, but subsequently did not differ significantly from pre-CACh values. At 5 hr after CACh, individual values ranged from 95 to 137% of the corresponding pre-CACh measurements, at 8 hr from 94 to 150%, and at 11 hr from 80 to 121%. This random sample of children with asthma demonstrated no LAR after CACh.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Guinea pig ozone-induced airway hyperreactivity is associated with increased N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.High level ozone exposure is known to cause acute, neutrophil-independent airway hyperreactivity in the guinea pig. The precise biochemical mechanisms involved remain unclear. Because of its potential pathophysiologic importance, we examined whether a lysosomal hydrolase, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAGA) was released from the airways in vivo and from bronchoalveolar cells, specifically macrophages. Muscarinic reactivity was determined by measuring specific airway resistance (sRaw) in response to increasing doses of aerosolized acetylcholine in guinea pigs that were either exposed to air or to ozone (3.0 ppm, 2 h). The ozone-exposed animals showed substantial muscarinic hyperreactivity 30 min after exposure. In addition, both total and percent released NAGA in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained immediately after reactivity testing were significantly greater in the ozone-exposed group. It was also found that substantially more NAGA was released from mixed bronchoalveolar lavage cells in response to 20 microM A23187. Moreover, bronchoalveolar macrophages of ozone-exposed animals secreted more NAGA upon stimulation in vitro by either 20 microM A23187 or 200 micrograms/ml opsonized zymosan. We conclude that ozone-induced airway hyperreactivity in guinea pigs is associated with the presence of increased NAGA activity in bronchoalveolar fluid. Our data suggest that bronchoalveolar macrophages may, at least in part, be responsible for release of this enzyme into the airways after ozone exposure.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The influence of cyclooxygenase inhibition on the loss of bronchoconstrictor response to repeated bradykinin challenge in asthma.Bradykinin is a naturally occurring nonapeptide which may contribute to the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma. When inhaled by asthmatic subjects it is a potent bronchoconstrictor, but with repeated challenge airways responsiveness to the peptide decreases markedly. In vitro studies suggest that loss of bradykinin responsiveness may be due to the secondary generation of relaxant prostanoids. We have used the potent cyclooxygenase inhibitor flurbiprofen to investigate the potential role of prostanoid generation in bradykinin tachyphylaxis in eight asthmatic patients. The effects of oral flurbiprofen (150 mg) and matched placebo were observed on two consecutive dose response studies with inhaled bradykinin and histamine in a double-blind, randomized study. Venous blood was taken to measure the serum concentration of thromboxane B2 (TxB2) as a check on the extent of cyclooxygenase blockade achieved by flurbiprofen. Following recovery from the first challenge with bradykinin, the asthmatic airways showed a reduced response to a second challenge with this nonapeptide, the provocative concentration producing a 20% fall from baseline (PC20) increasing from 0.07 to 0.42 mg.ml-1 (p less than 0.01). The airway response to inhaled histamine after the second bradykinin challenge was not significantly changed. In the presence of demonstrable cyclooxygenase inhibition, flurbiprofen failed to prevent the development of reduced responsiveness to bradykinin observed on the second challenge, the PC20 increasing from 0.10 to 0.48 mg.ml-1 (p less than 0.01). This study demonstrates that repeated exposure to inhaled bradykinin results in loss of the bronchoconstrictor response which appears specific for this agonist and not secondary to the increased generation of protective prostanoids.\n",

There was one asthmatic patient with the homozygous deficient phenotype ZZ. The result revealed that there were more deficient heterozygous phenotypes in the asthmatic group than the control group. There was also a positive correlation between the number of patients with deficient phenotypes and the severity of asthma (P less than 0.02). Analysis of the serum A1AT levels revealed that as a group the asthmatic patients had significantly lower A1AT levels (1.97 +/- 0.18 g/l) than the control group (2.21 +/- 0.15 g/l) (P less than 0.01). However, there was no statistically significant difference in the A1AT serum levels of patients with P1MM phenotype and the control of the same phenotype. Statistical analysis could not be done for the other phenotypes because of the small number of subjects.

We evaluated the efficacy of regular use of metered dose inhaler of disodium cromoglycate (DSCG-MDI) in the daily management of Thai asthmatic children. The study comprised nineteen children with the age range of 8-15 years (mean 11.6 years). During a two week baseline period, the patients recorded their baseline symptom scores, requirement of their asthma medications (medication scores) and their morning/evening peak flow (PEFR) readings. Thereafter, DSCG-MDI was prescribed at the dosage of two puffs (1 mg/puff) four times daily for eight weeks. Patients were examined at two week intervals at which daily score cards along with PEFR records were collected. Significant reduction in the medication scores and in the requirement for maintenance bronchodilators were noted (p less than 0.01) within two weeks of use of the DSCG-MDI. Morning and evening PEFR's increased significantly and this increase reached statistical significance at 4 weeks after the initiation of the treatment (p less than 0.01). No side effects were reported throughout the study; the aerosol was well tolerated. In this open study DSCG-MDI, at a dose of 1 mg four times daily, significantly improved asthma symptoms along with PEFR readings in Thai asthmatic children and reduced the need for concomitant asthma medications.\n",

Twelve patients with endoscopically-proven healed duodenal ulcer were studied twice under double-blind conditions in cross-over experiments. In a 1-hour infusion, six patients received either 240 mg aminophylline i.v. or 200 mg doxofylline i.v., and six received either 240 mg aminophylline i.v. or 400 mg doxofylline i.v.

Intravenous doxofylline did not stimulate a significant increase of either acid or pepsin output (200 mg: acid output +4%, pepsin output +10%; 400 mg: acid output +25%, pepsin output +27%). These findings suggest that doxofylline, unlike aminophylline, has a low secretagogue activity and it may be more suitable for asthmatic patients with peptic ulcer disease.\n",

The average value, standard residual deviation and the variation coefficient were calculated for each parameter studied in different clinical moments. The results are presented on 3 groups: per total, symptomatic and asymptomatic. The analysis of the data found showed that the variation of the parameters measured during repeated functional examinations in children with bronchial asthma ranges within broad limits (2.9%-11.5%); the broadest variation was recorded for Raw followed by MEF50 and the slightest variation was that of the VC/MEVS ratio.

The binding study with serum proteins fractionated with DEAE-Sephadex A-50 from both allergic and normal subjects using 14C-labeled salicylate showed that the salicylate molecule binds exclusively to Alb. No correlation was observed between the binding ability corrected for Alb and the serum Alb concentration in allergic and normal subjects. From the evidence obtained, there seems to be a certain underlying diathesis related to the Alb binding ability to endogenous inflammatory substances, which may back up the consequences of allergic reactions among allergic individuals.\n",

A study was carried out on 4 groups of supposedly immunocompromised patients for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and anti-HBs. The 4 groups of patients were suffering from: Leprosy, Bronchial asthma, Diabetes and hepatosplenic Schistosomiasis. Serum specimens were obtained from 137 patients representing the 4 groups and from a control group of 25 healthy individuals. All sera were tested by ELISA technique for HBsAg and anti-HBs. Results indicated that HBsAg carrier rate was 4% for the control healthy group, 7% for Bronchial asthma, 10% for Diabetes, 24% for Leprosy and 28% for hepatosplenic Schistosomiasis. On the other hand, the anti-HBs was 21% for the control group, 29% for Schistosomiasis, 55% and 58% for Diabetes and Bronchial asthma respectively and 74% for Leprosy. This study shows that immunosuppressed patients particularly those suffering from leprosy and hepatosplenic Schistosomiasis experience higher HBsAg carrier rate than the control group for the endemic hepatitis B (6-7 times higher for leprosy and Schistosomiasis). An important observation was the diminished anti-HBs rate in hepatosplenic Schistosomiasis patients, despite the highest HBsAg carrier rate they exhibited. This may be due to an immunological defect, resulting in an unsatisfactory antibody response and chronic hepatitis B antigenemia. In Egypt, where Schistosomiasis is prevalent (40-50%), the problems caused by hepatitis B infection are increased.\n",

All the children were subjected to full history including dietetic questionnaire, thorough examination, and to estimation of serum IgE, serum ceruloplasmin, and zinc and copper levels in both serum and hairs. The mean concentrations of zinc in serum and hairs were respectively 70.3 +/- 13.2 micrograms/100 ml and 167.5 +/- 23.0 micrograms/gm in asthmatic cases and 65.9 +/- 11.7 micrograms/100 ml and 164.8 +/- 23.6 micrograms/gm in those with atopic dermatitis. These levels were significantly (p less than 0.001) decreased in comparison to the control values (88.4 +/- 11.0 micrograms/100 ml and 194.5 +/- 18.6 micrograms/gm). On the other hand, a significant (p less than 0.001) increase in serum and hairs copper was demonstrated in both allergic groups compared to the controls. Mean copper values were respectively 79.5 +/- 8.06 micrograms/100 ml and 18.7 +/- 1.9 micrograms/gm in the asthmatic cases and 81.4 +/- 8.4 micrograms/100 ml and 17.8 +/- 2.08 micrograms/gm in cases with atopic dermatitis. The control mean concentrations were 67.95 +/- 6.37 micrograms/100 ml and 14.5 +/- 2.53 micrograms/gm respectively. Significant (p less than 0.001) higher levels of serum ceruloplasmin were observed in the allergic patients compared to the controls and were correlated with the hypercupremia. The results were discussed and a good dietetic intake of high biological value protein and zinc supplement was recommended to these patients in order to correct their disturbances especially the hypozincemia which could lead to exaggeration of their allergic conditions. The field of trace elements metabolism has grown rapidly over the past few years, particularly after the development of novel techniques as the atomic absorption spectrophotometry which had allowed the reliable measurements of several trace elements in tissues and so had opened a new field for many researches (Henkin, 1976). Zinc and copper are involved in cell and tissue growth. Zinc plays an important role in DNA and protein synthesis and is intimately involved with copper as cofactors in several important enzyme systems. The effects of many pathological conditions as congestive heart failure, pneumonia, rheumatic heart diseases, bronchitis, recurrent infection, hemolytic anemia, psoriasis, and malnutrition on the levels of serum zinc, copper, and other trace elements have been of interest to investigators for a number of years (Sinha and Gabrieli, 1970; David et al., 1984).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\n",

      "ABSTRACT Oxitropium bromide: an acute dose response study of a new anticholinergic drug in combination with fenoterol in asthma and chronic bronchitis.The aim of this study was to compare the bronchodilator response of patients with either stable asthma or stable chronic bronchitis to the acute administration of oxitropium bromide and a beta agonist (fenoterol) when given both separately and together in order to determine the responses of these two groups of patients and the optimal doses of these agents when given in combination. The responses of 23 patients with asthma and 25 patients with chronic bronchitis to 400 micrograms of fenoterol, and 200 micrograms of oxitropium given either alone or together with 100, 200 or 400 micrograms of fenoterol was studied. The peak bronchodilator response to oxitropium bromide of the patients with chronic bronchitis was equivalent to the fenoterol response while, in the patients with asthma, the response to oxitropium bromide was approximately 30% of the response to fenoterol. In both groups of subjects the addition of oxitropium bromide to fenoterol significantly increased both the magnitude and the duration of the bronchodilator response without a significant increase in side effects. In both groups of subjects 200 micrograms of oxitropium bromide and 200 micrograms or more of fenoterol gave the optimal response.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Effect of sensitization and aerosol antigen challenge in guinea-pigs--studies of airway receptor function and characteristics.Immunological sensitization of guinea-pigs and subsequent antigen inhalation challenge has provided an animal model which has several features in common with human asthma. Impairment of beta-adrenoceptor-mediated function and mechanisms have been postulated to contribute to the hyperreactivity to contractile agonists demonstrated in vivo and in vitro in these animals. Functional and receptor radioligand binding studies were carried out on airway tissue from: non-sensitized; sensitized; sensitized saline challenged; sensitized antigen challenged guinea-pigs. Sensitization did not alter responsiveness of airway tissue to carbachol, although subsequent antigen challenge did increase carbachol sensitivity of peripheral airway tissue six-fold. Neither sensitization itself nor subsequent antigen challenge altered binding characteristics of the muscarinic cholinoceptor ligand [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) to peripheral airway tissue, suggesting that mechanisms responsible for increases in carbachol sensitivity are distal to these receptors. Relaxation of airway preparations to isoprenaline was not altered by sensitization or further antigen challenge of the animals. However, sensitization significantly reduced affinity but not the total number of binding sites in peripheral airway tissue for the beta-adrenoceptor ligand [3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA). Antigen challenge of the animals did not further alter beta-adrenoceptor ligand binding characteristics. These results suggest that airway hyperreactivity in this model is not a function of alteration in receptor characteristics, or impairment of relaxation mechanisms.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Relative efficacy of nebulised ipratropium bromide and fenoterol in acute severe asthma.In a double-blind, randomised, controlled clinical trial of 145 patients with acute asthma, the efficacy of nebulised 4-hourly ipratropium bromide plus 4-hourly fenoterol (group I, 50 patients), 2-hourly fenoterol (group II, 50 patients) and 4-hourly fenoterol (group III, 45 patients) was assessed. All patients received an optimal infusion of aminophylline and 81 patients (27 in each group) received hydrocortisone for clinical indications. It was found that cholinergic side-effects in group I were not more common than in group II. Tremor was more common in group II. Assessment of bronchodilator efficacy was confined to the 81 patients whose therapy included hydrocortisone. Peak expiratory flow rate, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and forced vital capacity were expressed as a percentage of predicted for each individual and the mean values for each group plotted. It was found that the response rate, as assessed by the area under the curve, was significantly more rapid in group I compared with both group II (P less than 0.001) and group III (P less than 0.005). These findings were consistent for all three lung function measurements. However, there was no significant difference in the responses between group II and group III. It is concluded that adding ipratropium bromide to conventional regimens is likely to benefit patients with acute asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Airways responses to ipratropium bromide do not vary with time in asthmatic subjects. Studies of interindividual and intraindividual variation of bronchodilatation and protection against histamine-induced bronchoconstriction.Bronchial histamine provocation tests were performed in nine patients with nonallergic asthma on four consecutive days 45 minutes after inhalation of placebo or ipratropium bromide in a dose-response manner (40 micrograms, 200 micrograms, and 800 micrograms). The drugs were administered double-blind, one dose on each day. This procedure was repeated identically after three to nine months to investigate whether the bronchial responses to ipratropium bromide are constant or change with time. Ipratropium bromide induced a significantly better bronchodilation and protection against histamine-induced bronchoconstriction than placebo with no differences between the three doses. No correlation between bronchodilatation and protection was found. In six asthmatic patients (\"responders\") ipratropium bromide induced a significant protective effect against histamine-induced bronchoconstriction but no dose-response relationship was found. In three patients none or a very poor protective effect was found at all dose levels (\"nonresponders\"). The protective effect of ipratropium bromide against histamine-induced bronchoconstriction did not differ between the first and second occasion. Thus, the bronchoprotection differed between different asthmatic subjects but did not vary with time (three to nine months) within the same subject. This finding seems to be of clinical importance since it implicates that the effect of anticholinergic agents on the airways is predictable.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Nebulized ipratropium in the treatment of acute asthma.The efficacy of ipratropium and salbutamol was determined in 117 patients with acute asthma who presented to an emergency department to determine whether the order of administration of the two agents affects the improvement in peak flow rates. Patients were given two nebulized treatments at an interval of one hour in a randomized, double-blind design. They received either 5 mg nebulized salbutamol followed by 0.5 mg ipratropium, ipratropium followed by salbutamol, or both drugs administered together followed by nebulized saline. Ipratropium was an effective bronchodilator when given as the first agent. Simultaneous administration with salbutamol was as effective as sequential administration. At one hour after treatment, there was no difference in peak flow between the combination of drugs and either drug given alone. Ipratropium given after salbutamol was not superior to saline solution given after the combination of drugs.

      "ABSTRACT Efficacy and duration of action of oral procaterol in asthmatic children after single administration of different dosages.A double-blind crossover study was performed to evaluate the bronchodilating effect of different single doses of procaterol (less than 0.5 micrograms/kg, 1.5 micrograms/kg, and placebo) orally administered. Sixteen asthmatic children, age 6-12 years, participated in the trial. Pulmonary function, heart rate, blood pressure, and tremor were evaluated at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min and then hourly for 8 hours after administration. All three doses were therapeutically effective. The 1.5 micrograms/kg dose produced a more sustained bronchodilatation effect, but was also associated with an increase in the incidence of tremors.

A constant dose of sustained-release theophylline and albuterol by inhalation, as needed, was administered. Compared to placebo, colchicine, 0.5 mg twice daily, significantly reduced the mean (+/- SEM) daily clinical score from 2.18 +/- 0.34 to 1.64 +/- 0.32 (p less than 0.05), and the daily number of inhalations of albuterol from 5.89 +/- 1.48 to 4.01 +/- 1.26 (p less than 0.02). Colchicine significantly (p less than 0.05) increased the concanavalin A-induced suppressor cell function from 16.2 +/- 4.6% to 39.0 +/- 10.7%, which was similar to healthy volunteers (41.1 +/- 3.5%). Furthermore, colchicine significantly (p less than 0.05) decreased serum IgE from 248 +/- 63 to 188 +/- 46 IU/ml. Colchicine had no significant effect on pulmonary function tests, the early phase reaction of antigen-induced bronchial inhalation challenge, and immediate skin test responses. Thus, colchicine has immunomodulatory effects that may perhaps have a mild benefit in the treatment of asthma.\n",

Release of histamine and other mediators from mast cells and stimulation of lung irritant receptors are mechanisms that may be involved in nebulized distilled water-induced bronchoconstriction. To investigate the contribution of these mechanisms the effect of terfenadine and ipratropium bromide on the bronchial response to this stimulus was assessed. A total of 30 asthmatics (mean 28.7 years) were submitted on three different days to distilled water challenge with or without prior treatment with oral terfenadine or inhaled aerosolized ipratropium bromide. The decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 s induced by the same dose of distilled water was significantly (P less than 0.001) reduced from 35.6 +/- 15.8% to 19.5 +/- 16% with terfenadine and to 23.9 +/- 19.7% with ipratropium bromide.

      "ABSTRACT Effective therapy of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis with medroxyprogesterone acetate.The effect of long-acting medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) on the trabecular bone density in patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GCO) was evaluated. Thirteen steroid-dependent asthmatic male patients with GCO were administered 200 mg MPA intramuscularly at 6-week intervals and 1 g of elemental calcium daily for a period of 1 year. Ten additional matched steroid-dependent asthmatic male patients received 1 g of elemental calcium daily (controls). All 23 patients involved in the study had vertebral trabecular bone densitometry (TBD) by quantitative computed tomography (QCT) at baseline and at 6 and 12 months into the study. A 17% increase in TBD was found in the MPA-treated patients at 1 year (from 68.5 +/- 5 to 80.2 +/- 4 mg K2HPO4/cc) in contrast to the control group who experienced a 21% decrease in TBD during the same period of time (from 80.5 +/- 7 to 63.7 +/- 8 mg K2HPO4/cc) (T = 6.90, P = 0.0001 df = 21). There were no significant changes in other parameters followed during the study in the MPA-treated group (serum calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, PTH, alkaline phosphatase, triglycerides, total and HDL cholesterol, urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, creatinine) except for a decrease in the serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone (P less than 0.01) as well as of the hydroxyproline-creatinine ratio (P less than 0.01). The results lend support to the hypothesis of a progesterone-glucocorticoid competitive antagonism at the bone level, though other possibilities can be entertained, and suggest MPA as an effective therapy for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in men.\n",

Df-induced IL2 responsiveness was also observed in normal lymphocytes pretreated (Day 0) with anti-CD45R antibody, which recognize suppressor inducer subset among CD4+ T cells. However anti-CD45R antibody was no longer effective when the lymphocytes were cultured for more than one day with the antigen, suggesting its effect in the initial phase of the reaction. The intensity of the response induced in normal lymphocytes by the anti-CD45R was comparable to that of the patients sensitized to the nominal antigen. The response of the patients was no longer augmented by the anti-CD45R antibody. Taken together, these data suggest that even normal lymphocytes have potentiality to elicit Df-induced IL2 responsiveness and it is probably derepressed by inhibiting suppressor inducer subset with the anti-CD45R antibody. Also suggested is a defective suppressor inducer activity in the lymphocytes which may lead to hyperreactivity to allergens in asthmatic children.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Bronchial asthma is not associated with auto-antibodies to lipocortin-1.Corticosteroids may mediate some of their anti-inflammatory action by the induction of lipocortin-1, which inhibits phospholipase A2 activity. Raised levels of antibodies to lipocortin have been found in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and it has been postulated that these may contribute to steroid resistance. A proportion of asthmatic patients fail to respond to treatment with corticosteroids and one possible mechanism is that these patients have raised levels of anti-lipocortin antibodies. We have therefore measured IgG and IgM antibodies to lipocortin by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in eight corticosteroid-sensitive (CS) and 7 corticosteroid-resistant (CR) asthmatic subjects, and in eight normal controls. Comparison of asthmatic subjects with normal controls revealed no significant differences in either IgG or IgM antibodies to lipocortin. Comparison of CS asthmatic subjects with CR asthmatic subjects similarly revealed no significant differences in the concentration of either IgG or IgM antibodies to lipocortin. Levels of anti-lipocortin antibodies did not correlate with clinical response to treatment with 40 mg/day of prednisolone. Anti-lipocortin antibodies are unlikely to be involved in the inflammation seen in asthma, or in the relative insensitivity to corticosteroids seen in CR asthmatic subjects.\n",

In the placebo period there was a marked increase in plasma concentrations of both platelet factor 4 (PF4) and beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TBG). Intake of BN 52063 diminished the rise in plasma concentrations of PF4 and beta-TBG after the exercise challenge significantly. The results show that platelet activation after exercise induced asthma was markedly inhibited by BN 52063, indicating that PAF acts as a mediator in exercise induced asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Serum IgE and Fc epsilon receptor positive lymphocytes in atopic dermatitis--relation to the background of respiratory atopy].The serum IgE level and the population of Fc epsilon R2+ lymphocytes in peripheral blood of 62 patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) were studied. IgE was increased in the majority of the patients with personal or family history of asthma and/or allergic rhinitis (combined AD). On the contrary, only 63.2% of the patients who have solely AD (pure AD) showed less elevation of IgE. There was no correlation between IgE and the severity of dermatitis in pure AD and rhinitis combined AD. However, asthma combined AD showed a significant positive correlation between IgE and the severity of dermatitis. In AD, the population of Fc epsilon R2+ lymphocytes significantly correlated with IgE, suggesting that Fc epsilon R2+ lymphocytes may play a role in the enhanced synthesis of IgE. However, the increase of Fc epsilon R2+ lymphocytes was found only in combined AD, but not in pure AD. These results suggest that elevated IgE and Fc epsilon R2+ lymphocytes reflect combined respiratory atopy rather than AD itself, although there remains the possibility that IgE may influence the formation or exacerbation of dermatitis in asthma combined AD. As far as the participation of IgE is concerned, pure AD and asthma combined AD could be different groups and should be investigated separately.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Severe exacerbations of COPD and asthma. Incremental benefit of adding ipratropium to usual therapy.Single dose studies have assessed the utility of ipratropium bromide alone or with beta agonists in the short- and long-term management of chronic obstructive lung disease and asthma. We performed a randomized, double-blind trial to assess the incremental benefit over 24 hours of adding ipratropium vs placebo to a standardized regimen of medications commonly used in the acute and subsequent hospital management of COPD and asthma. Sixty-eight subjects received nebulized salbutamol, intravenous methylprednisolone, intravenous aminophylline, and antibiotics and were randomized to receive either 80 micrograms of ipratropium or placebo via metered dose inhaler and spacing device with each salbutamol treatment (6 to 8 times per day). Among the 50 patients who completed the study, there were no significant differences between ipratropium and placebo groups with respect to baseline FEV1, FVC, and PaCO2. The improvement of FEV1 from baseline to 24 hours was 294 (SD = 568) ml in the ipratropium group vs 393 (SD = 622) ml in placebo group. Adjusting FEV1 by age, gender, and smoking did not significantly alter the findings. Those with an admission diagnosis of asthma showed larger 24 hour FEV1 responses (487 ml in ipratropium vs 801 ml in placebo) than those with COPD (149 ml ipratropium vs 102 ml in placebo). However, within these two strata, there were no significant differences in FEV1 improvement between ipratropium and placebo groups. This study suggests that if ipratropium is used in the initial emergency treatment of COPD or asthma, it could safely be discontinued by 24 hours in order to reduce the cost and complexity of therapy.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Mortality and disability among cotton mill workers.The mortality and disability of cotton mill workers were studied in five Finnish cotton mills. The population under study comprised all 1065 women exposed to raw cotton dust who had been hired between 1950 and 1971. The minimum exposure period was five years. For the study on disability, the cohort was followed up until the end of 1981. The follow up period for the mortality analysis was from 1950 to 1985. At the end of 1981 the observed number of prevalent disability pensions for respiratory disease was 15, whereas 3.9 were expected (p less than 0.01) on the basis of the national figures for women. There were 46 musculoskeletal diseases (27.7 expected, p less than 0.01), of which 24 were osteoarthritis (14.5 expected) and 13 rheumatoid arthritis (6.6 expected). The incidence rates of disability pensions were calculated for the period 1969-81. Comparison of incidence rates between cotton mill workers and the Finnish female population showed excessive rates for both respiratory diseases (p less than 0.001) and musculoskeletal diseases (p less than 0.01), with an excess of new cases of rheumatoid arthritis (p less than 0.05). By the end of 1985 the number of person-years was 31,678 and the number of deaths 95. The standardised mortality ratios for the total period of follow up (1950-85) showed no excess for respiratory diseases. Mortality from cardiovascular diseases was also lower than expected. The observed number of tumours was 33, the corresponding expected number 32.0. Thirteen tumours were in the digestive organs (6.6 expected, p<0.05) and three were lung cancers (1.9 expected). Five workers had died from renal disease; the expected number was 1.5 (p<0.05).\n",

      "ABSTRACT The role of anticholinergic bronchodilators in adult asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Our renewed interest in anticholinergic bronchodilator therapy has been sparked by the development of safe yet effective quaternary anticholinergic compounds including ipratropium bromide, oxitropium and atropine methonitrate. These agents offer gradual and sustained bronchodilation to patients with asthma and to patients with COPD. However, their role in the maintenance treatment of these two diseases differs significantly. In asthma, the anticholinergic drugs have useful additive properties when used with adrenergic drugs or theophylline. They may be a particularly useful component of combination regimens in patients with disease of more than mild severity and in older patients. The combination of inhaled adrenergic and anticholinergic drugs is also useful in the acute setting for acute exacerbations of asthma. In chronic obstructive lung disease, the anticholinergic compounds offer greater bronchodilatation than adrenergic drugs for the majority of patients. Thus, the inhaled anticholinergic drugs may be considered as useful initial choices in the chronic maintenance therapy of COPD.\n",

This study describes the employment experience in relation to occupational choice and career advancement in 93 sequentially selected adult asthmatics attending a hospital based asthma clinic serving a socially disadvantaged urban population. Repeated hospital admissions and frequent asthma related sick leave from work were identified as contributing factors to employer discrimination, job dismissal, and lack of career advancement. Seventy-seven percent had not informed their employers of their asthma and 32% of those currently employed stated that getting time off work was a problem in relation to Asthma Clinic attendance. Of those not employed, 22.9% were receiving sickness or invalid benefits and 8.3% had lost their jobs because of asthma. This study illustrates how the stigma attached to the diagnosis of asthma in this community may not only impact negatively on employment opportunity, but also on asthma care.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Medico-legal statistics on occupational asthmna in Quebec between 1986 and 1988].The authors have carried out a statistical analysis of cases of occupational asthma and other occupational lung diseases submitted to the Ministry of Labour in Quebec between 1986 and 1988. The total number of claims was 913, 993, and 866 respectively for the 3 years of which 61% to 71% were accepted. 41% to 55% were new assessments. Of 228 new claims accepted in 1988, 81 (36%) were for occupational asthma. This number surpassed the number of claims accepted for traditional pneumoconiosis (asbestos = 30, and silicose = 36). Isocyanates were the principle cause of occupational asthma (23% of cases were recognised in 1988) followed by flour, red and white cedar, snow crab process workers, and various pharmaceutical products and grains. In comparison with statistics in 1977, one noticed there was a large reversal of the frequency of certain occupational lung diseases that are recognised, because at that time asbestosis and silicosis were the principle causes of claims put forward and accepted. The authors discuss the statistical bias of occupational lung disease obtained by medico-legal agencies. Although occupational asthma has not been the object of the systematic screening program in the work place and although there is a tendency for workers to avoid or abandon their occupation more often than in the traditional pneumoconioses current protection is sufficient in Quebec to motivate individuals who are possibly suffering from occupational asthma to put in a claim for compensation.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Transient neuromuscular impairment resulting from prolonged inhalation of halothane and enflurane.Inhalation anesthesia first with halothane followed by enflurane relieved a patient with status asthmaticus who was refractory to conventional therapy including mechanical ventilation. After 13 days of anesthesia while on mechanical ventilation and employing nondepolarizing muscle relaxants, significant neuromuscular impairment, manifested by tetraplegia and sensory disturbance, developed. Anesthesia was discontinued on day 14, and the patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation on day 16. Over the next two months, the neuromuscular impairment markedly improved. Halothane was associated with cardiac arrhythmias and hepatitis necessitating replacement by enflurane. Enflurane appeared to be as effective a treatment for refractory asthma as halothane. The most probable cause of the neuromuscular impairment in our patient was the long-term use of inhalation anesthetics or nondepolarizing muscle relaxants.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Bronchoconstriction induced by spirometric maneuvers in patients with bronchial asthma.We analyzed forced expiration maneuver-induced bronchoconstriction in 14 asthmatic patients and in seven normal subjects by breaking down the forced expiration maneuver of spirometry (the FVC maneuver) into two phases: a slow, deep inspiration to the total lung capacity (TLC) (the DI maneuver) and a forced expiration to the residual volume (RV) (the PFV maneuver). Specific airway conductance (sGaw) was measured at functional residual capacity (FRC) after each of the three maneuvers. All of the maneuvers caused the greatest bronchoconstriction immediately after completion of the maneuver. The mean decreases in the sGaw immediately after the FVC, DI, and PFV maneuvers were 45.0 +/- 6.6 (SD)% (P less than .001), 29.6 +/- 5.3% (P less than .001), and 16.7 +/- 5.3% (P less than .03), respectively. The decrease in sGaw by the FVC maneuver was very close to the combined algebraic sum of the DI maneuver and the PFV maneuver. The normal subjects did not show any changes in the sGaw by any of the maneuvers. The inhalation of albuterol almost abolished the response of bronchoconstriction to any of the three maneuvers, but inhalation of an anticholinergic agent, ipratropium bromide, did blunt the response. This study suggests that forced expiration maneuver-induced bronchoconstriction in asthmatics can be caused not only by deep inspiration to the TLC but also by forced expiration to the RV, and that the bronchoconstriction may be brought about mainly by an increase in parasympathetic activity.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Clinical study on the inhibitory effect of AA-2414 on platelet function in asthmatic patients].We studied the effect of AA-2414, a TXA2 receptor antagonist, on platelet function in 12 asthmatic patients, 6 males and 6 females, whose mean age was 43.6 years. AA-2414 was orally administered to each patient at 20 mg/day for two weeks and then at 40 mg/day for the following two weeks. Platelet aggregation, plasma concentration of TXB2, and serum concentrations of AA-2414 and its metabolites were measured before and after the administration of each dose. Platelet aggregation induced by U-46619 (an analogue of PGH2), STA2 (a stable analogue of TXA2) and arachidonic acid with the administration of AA-2414 was significantly inhibited. The degree of this inhibition was proportional to the serum level of the drug. Plasma concentration of TXA2 tended to be lowered by administration of AA-2414, but it was not statistically significant. Eight (75.0%) of the 12 patients showed clinical improvement. In the cases where the drug was ineffective, the inhibition of platelet aggregation after administration of AA-2414 was less than in those cases where it was effective. We conclude that AA-2414 might exert its antiplatelet and antiasthmatic effects through antagonism of the TXA2 receptor. Investigation of the response to AA-2414 may be useful in assessing the clinical effect of this compound.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Bronchodilator responses to salbutamol followed by ipratropium bromide in partially reversible airflow obstruction.We have performed a retrospective survey on 296 patients, who attended the Respiratory Function Unit at Guy's Hospital to have their bronchodilator responses (BR) tested. The aim of the study was to see the effect of ipratropium bromide (IB) in a group of patients with incomplete reversibility after salbutamol (S). Patients were routinely given salbutamol and ipratropium bromide sequentially by inhalation, and spirometric changes were recorded after each drug. We identified two groups: Group A, 95 patients with FEV1 response greater than or equal to 0.2 l after either drug and FEV1 less than 80% predicted after salbutamol; and, Group B, 49 with change in FEV1 less than 0.02 l, FVC less than 80% predicted after salbutamol and an improvement in FVC greater than or equal to 0.33 l. Seventy-nine of the 95 patients in Group A also had an FVC response. In Group A, age was negatively correlated with response to salbutamol (r = -0.41, P less than 0.0001), and within Group B baseline FVC was negatively correlated with response to ipratropium bromide (r = -0.30, P = 0.03). There were no differences in age, sex, or doses given to each group (median dose: salbutamol, 800 micrograms, ipratropium bromide 120 micrograms). Baseline FEV1 and FVC (% predicted) were significantly higher in FEV1 responders. Mean (SD) FEV1 were 43% (14) in Group A vs. 29% (14) in Group B, while FVC were 62% (16) vs. 47% (13), P less than 0.001. Responses to ipratropium bromide were more frequent in Group B; in Group A 87% improved after salbutamol and 26% after ipratropium bromide, while in Group B 68% responded to salbutamol and 47% to ipratropium bromide (P = 0.03). Most patients responded to salbutamol, but in 33% ipratropium bromide had an additional effect. The FEV1 response to salbutamol declined with age. Isolated volume responders had more severe airflow obstruction, had less responses to salbutamol and were more likely to show a response to ipratropium bromide. These results support a trial of ipratropium bromide in patients with inadequate beta responsiveness, especially in those with severe airflow obstruction.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Comparison of the effect of loratadine on the airway and skin responses to histamine, methacholine, and allergen in subjects with asthma.Loratadine is a highly selective, long-acting, H1-receptor antagonist. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study, we evaluated the effects of loratadine, 10 and 20 mg, and placebo administered once daily for 3 days on the skin-wheal responses to histamine, the airway responses to inhaled histamine and methacholine, and the skin-wheal and airway responses to allergen in 12 subjects with asthma. There was no evidence of a bronchodilator action 3 hours after a third oral dose. In the airways, the geometric mean of the provocative concentration of histamine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 after placebo or loratadine, 10 and 20 mg, was 0.68 mg/ml, 2.71 mg/ml (p, not significant), and 5.96 mg/ml (p less than 0.05), respectively. The concentration ratios (value after active treatment/value after placebo) for loratadine, 10 and 20 mg, were 5.1 (p less than 0.05) and 13.4 (p less than 0.05). Neither dose of loratadine had any significant effect on the methacholine dose-response relationship. In the skin, loratadine also displaced the histamine log-concentration response curves to the right with concentration ratios of 4.7 and 6.7, respectively. Loratadine, 10 and 20 mg, had no protective effect on the early or late-phase bronchoconstrictor responses to inhaled allergen. In the skin, loratadine, 20 mg, significantly inhibited the mean wheal area to allergen. Thus, in the dose regimens studied, although loratadine is a moderately potent and selective H1 antagonist in the skin and airways, it failed to attenuate the early and late airway responses to inhaled allergen.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Home nebulizers: can optimal therapy be predicted by laboratory studies?Twenty patients (six severe asthma, 14 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD) were referred for consideration of domiciliary nebulized treatment. A double blind laboratory assessment demonstrated similar subjective and objective responses to nebulized salbutamol (5 mg), ipratropium bromide (IB) (0.5 mg) or a mixture of these medications in both groups of patients. The patients subsequently self-administered each treatment four times daily for one month. Fourteen patients requested long-term home nebulizer treatment (three salbutamol, four ipratropium bromide, seven mixture), and nine of these had their highest domiciliary peak flow recordings during home nebulizer treatment. However, subjective and objective laboratory assessments did not clearly predict the patients long-term choice of therapy in any case. There was little overall correlation between the laboratory response and the domiciliary response to treatment (Spearman correlation coefficient; subjective score, laboratory vs. home, r = 0.27, P = 0.03; peak flow response 30 min after treatment, laboratory vs. home, r = 0.31, P less than 0.02). The hospital study was also unreliable in predicting side effects during domiciliary nebulizer use. We conclude that prospective laboratory studies are of little value in the assessment of patients for home nebulizer therapy; these assessments must be made by carefully supervised domiciliary trials of nebulized treatment.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Weaning an asthmatic using biphasic positive airway pressure together with continuous sufentanil administration].A patient presenting with acute severe asthma associated with protracted hypoventilation (paCO2 = 90 mmHg) and impaired consciousness underwent sedation and controlled mechanical ventilation. The peak airway pressure could be reduced by constant-volume mechanical ventilation and analgosedation with midazolam and ketamine. When the gas exchange had stabilized, the first attempt at weaning was made by synchronized intermittent mechanical ventilation (SIMV). After this and two other attempts had failed, the patient was given continuous sufentanil (0.8-1.0 micrograms/kg), as well as additional bolus injections of 2 micrograms/kg and 0.35 micrograms/kg for analgosedation. Controlled mechanical ventilation was replaced by the system of biphasic positive airway pressure (BIPAP). The mechanical ventilatory support was gradually reduced, as was the dose of continuous sufentanil. Extubation was possible at a dose of 0.2 micrograms/kg per h sufentanil and CPAP. From this case, it is not possible to determine whether the BIPAP system or the analgosedation with Sufentanil was the decisive factor in the therapeutic success. It may well have been the combination of both therapeutic measures that--in our opinion--supplemented each other in an ideal way.\n",

In 26.32% of the patients who had not been treated with corticosteroids the basic cortisole level was either decreased or on the lower normal limit. At the same time in 55% of these patients a different degree increase of the basic DHEA-sulfate level was found and in 30% of the patients the androstanedione basic level was increased. The changes in the 24 h rhythm of androstanedione and DHEA-sulfate secretion were similar to those of cortisol. Normal rhythm of secretion of cortisol, aldosterone and testosterone was established mainly in patients with preserved basic hormonal secretion. In contrast to these, normal rhythm of androstanedione and DHEA-sulfate secretion was found more frequently in patients with increased basic secretion of these hormones.\n",

Questionnaires were sent to 20,000 individuals aged 20-65 years, randomly selected from the population register. Those subjects (1385) considering themselves to have had hand eczema within the previous 12 months were invited to a dermatological examination. It was found that a history of childhood eczema was the most important predictive factor for hand eczema. Second was female sex, followed by occupational exposure, a history of asthma and/or hay fever, and a service occupation. A small decrease in risk with advancing age was also found. The difference in the probability of having had eczema in a 1-year period, between individuals having the most important risk factors studied and those having none of them, proved to be for females 48% compared to 8%, and for males 34% compared to 4%. A history of childhood eczema was found to be more common among young persons, indicating an increase in the prevalence of atopic dermatitis. Of those individuals who reported childhood eczema, 27% reported hand eczema on some occasion during the last 12 months.\n",

Nearly all drug solutions were hypoosmolar and the osmolality increased during nebulisation with 11 to 62%. Therefore, it is suggested to dilute these drugs with saline 0.9% and to restrict nebulisation time to 10 minutes, since the most striking increase of osmolality was noted after 10 minutes.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Acid fog-induced bronchoconstriction. The role of hydroxymethanesulfonic acid.Hydroxymethanesulfonate (HMSA), the bisulfite (HSO3-) adduct of formaldehyde (CH2O), is a common constituent of California acid fogs. HMSA, most stable in a fog pH range of 3 to 5, dissociates at 6.6, the pH of the fluid lining human airways. The dissociation of inhaled HMSA should theoretically generate sulfur dioxide and CH2O, both of which have bronchoconstrictor potential. Thus, we hypothesized that HMSA may have a specific bronchoconstrictor effect independent of its strength as an acid. To determine whether HMSA has such an effect, 19 subjects with mild to moderate asthma were studied using two different protocols. Initially, a mouthpiece study was performed in which 9 subjects, on 2 separate days, inhaled five aerosols containing either sequentially increasing concentrations (0, 30, 100, 300, and 1000 microM) of HMSA in 50 microM sulfuric acid (H2SO4) or 50 microM H2SO4 alone. The subjects inhaled each aerosol for 3 min during tidal breathing at rest. Specific airway resistance (SRaw) was measured before and after each 3-min exposure. There were no significant differences in the mean changes in SRaw among the various aerosol exposures. To confirm this lack of bronchoconstrictor effect of HMSA, we then performed a chamber study in which 10 freely breathing, intermittently exercising subjects were exposed to fog containing either 1 mM HMSA in 5 mM H2SO4 or 5 mM H2SO4 alone for 1 h. SRaw was measured before, during, and at the end of the 1-h exposure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "ABSTRACT Receptors in airway disease. Beta-adrenoceptors in lung inflammation.Beta-adrenoceptor dysfunction and increase in airway reactivity can be induced by administration of gram-negative bacteria, endotoxin, viruses, and allergens in laboratory animals. However, the deterioration of lung beta-adrenoceptor function is not invariably associated with lung inflammation. Severe asthmatics, but not asthmatics per se, show a diminished beta-adrenoceptor function of airway smooth muscle. These changes are probably a consequence of the active disease state rather than an intrinsic component of asthma. Mediators released from inflammatory cells such as reactive oxygen species and fatty acid metabolites may directly or indirectly induce beta-adrenoceptor dysfunction. Beta-adrenoceptor function of leukocytes from asthmatic patients can be decreased as well and it is suggested that lymphokines like interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma may affect beta-adrenoceptor function. A disturbed beta-adrenoceptor function on inflammatory cells themselves may have consequences for their immune function, mediator release, and effect on surrounding tissues.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Receptors in asthmatic airways.Airway tissue obtained postmortem from nondiseased and severely asthmatic human lung was used in functional, radioligand binding and autoradiographic studies to investigate aspects of various receptor systems for putative mediators of asthma. Results indicate that asthma does not involve an intrinsic abnormality of smooth muscle contractility to spasmogens. Nor was there any evidence for up-regulation of histamine H1-receptor, muscarinic cholinoceptor, or alpha 1-adrenoceptor function. Conversely, severe asthma involving intense airway inflammation resulted in significant beta-adrenoceptor dysfunction, probably caused by receptor uncoupling from adenylate cyclase. Evidence was also obtained for histamine and methacholine-induced release of a nonprostanoid, airway epithelium-derived inhibitory factor (EpDIF), which may have a significant dilator effect in the adjacent bronchial circulation. The activity of this potentially protective inhibitory autacoid system would be expected to be reduced in asthma, which commonly involves epithelium damage. The autoradiographic distribution of specific binding sites for 125I-labeled substance P (I-SP) was also determined in bronchi from healthy humans and asthmatics. In sharp contrast to guinea pig airways where high levels of binding were detected over smooth muscle, specific I-SP binding was sparse over human airway smooth muscle from both sources, while dense binding was associated with structures immediately beneath the epithelium and with deep submucosal glands. These data suggest a more significant role for SP in secretory processes than in spasmogenic processes in human bronchi and highlight the potential for drawing invalid conclusions concerning human airway function from studies using animal models.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Autonomic nervous system abnormalities and asthma.Autonomic nervous system function has been studied both in vitro and in vivo using a variety of methodologies. In asthmatic patients, beta-adrenergic hyporesponsiveness and alpha-adrenergic and cholinergic hyperresponsiveness can be frequently demonstrated. These observations have provided support for the beta blockade theory of asthma, advanced in the late 1960s by Andor Szentivanyi's experiments involving sensitized rodents. However, in addition to asthma, aberrations in autonomic nervous system function have been noted in other individuals including cystic fibrosis patients and their parents, patients with emphysema and bronchitis, and in patients (allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis) who have demonstrable IgE antibody responses to a variety of antigens. Thus, although these defects are not specific for asthma, it is noteworthy that these conditions share many clinical features; the ultimate phenotypic expression of these abnormalities may depend on both genetic and environmental factors that have yet to be defined.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The hormonal response to exercise in asthma.The hormonal responses to exercise of 10 asthmatic patients and 12 normal subjects were compared by studying the changes in the plasma levels of growth hormone, prolactin, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol induced by treadmill running.

None of these patients were being treated with systemic corticosteroids and there was no difference between the responses of users and non-users of beclomethasone dipropionate.

      "ABSTRACT Neutrophil chemotactic activity in toluene diisocyanate (TDI)-induced asthma.We quantitated serum neutrophil chemotactic activity (NCA), which is associated with mast cell or basophil activation, to determine if mast cell or basophil mediators are released during bronchoprovocation-inhalation challenge with subirritant levels of toluene diisocyanate (TDI). Four subjects with suspected TDI-induced asthma and four mite-sensitive subjects with asthma who served as a comparison group were studied. NCA was measured in a multiwell, microchemotaxis chamber. Blood samples were collected, and FEV1 measurements were performed before challenge and at regular intervals during the subsequent 24 hours. Three of four workers clinically sensitive to TDI reacted to a subirritant TDI exposure. There was no increase in NCA during placebo challenges. NCA increased in the three TDI-sensitive workers during early and late asthmatic reactions in quantities proportional to the FEV1 decline. No increase in NCA was found during TDI exposures in the TDI-negative worker. Gel filtration analysis demonstrated the main NCA fraction eluted with macromolecules of an estimated molecular weight greater than 440,000 daltons. This characteristic is compatible with neutrophil chemotactic factor of basophil or mast cell origin. The kinetics of NCA release were similar in mite- and TDI-induced asthmatic reactions. A high correlation (r = 0.97; p = 0.0006) was obtained between the percent decrease in FEV1 during early asthmatic reactions and percent increase in NCA. These observations support the hypothesis that activation of mast cells or basophils is associated with TDI-induced early and late asthmatic reaction.\n",

      "ABSTRACT A 3-month evaluation of the efficacy of nedocromil sodium in asthma: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of nedocromil sodium conducted by a Canadian multicenter study group.Nedocromil sodium is a pyranoquinoline dicarboxylic acid derivative, formulated in a metered-dose inhaler. Because nedocromil sodium has in vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory properties, it was evaluated in a group of steroid-dependent patients with asthma to observe how well it might be tolerated and for evidence of any beneficial effects. In a double-blind, group-comparative study, 127 patients received nedocromil sodium and 61 received placebo, administered as two puffs of 2 mg, four times per day, for 12 weeks. Ten patients developed adverse reactions, seven receiving active drug and three patients receiving placebo. Two patients of each group withdrew because of worsening asthma. Despite selecting patients whose asthma was stable, when they were receiving established therapeutic regimens that included steroids and bronchodilators, it was found that diary-card symptom scores, morning and evening peak expiratory flow rate values, and inhaled beta-agonist usage all demonstrated slight but significant benefit with addition of nedocromil sodium. It is concluded that the inhaled, anti-inflammatory agent, nedocromil sodium, may be added to asthma-treatment regimens with the reasonable expectation of further modest symptomatic benefit.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Long-term treatment with glucocorticoids/ACTH in asthmatic children. III. Effects on growth and adult height.The effect on growth of long-term treatment with prednisolone and/or ACTH (tetracosactrin) depot preparation was studied in 40 children with severe bronchial asthma. Height velocity was subnormal before treatment. During treatment the group of 17 children primarily treated with ACTH showed a moderate increase in mean velocity. Their height was not significantly altered, and neither was the age at peak height velocity nor adult height. In the group of 23 children treated with prednisolone the mean velocity decreased, resulting in a relative decrease in height. Peak height velocity was delayed by about 2 years in the boys but occurred at the expected time in the girls, as did menarche. Mean adult height was lower than expected after adjustment for mid-parenteral height. In 10 children ACTH was substituted for prednisolone, and their height velocity increased but not enough to affect adult height, which was just as low as in the patients treated with prednisolone only.\n",

This study compared the cation-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase enzyme (ATPase) activities of platelets from allergic (n = 18), potentially allergic (asymptomatic, positive skin test, n = 5) and normal patients (n = 10), all of whom were without symptoms at the time of the study. Platelets were separated by centrifugation, were sonicated, and were assayed for cation-dependent ATPase activity by spectrophotometry. The mean Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity (in nanomoles per microgram protein per minute) of allergic subjects (0.94 +/- 1.28) was significantly lower than that of normal subjects (3.93 +/- 1.58). No Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity was detectable in platelets from eight of the allergic subjects. The Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity of potentially allergic subjects was intermediate between those of the allergic and normal subjects. A significant negative correlation (p less than 0.01) was observed between serum IgE levels and platelet Na+,K(+)-ATPase values, thus suggesting a relationship between the reduced platelet Na+,K(+)-ATPase and IgE immunoglobulin. No such differences were observed for the Ca+(+)- and Mg+(+)-stimulated ATPases. In vivo dysfunction of the plasma membrane Na+,K(+)-ATPase enzyme in allergic subjects could have profound effects on levels of intracellular cations and thus platelet activation and function.\n",

Sodium metabisulfite.Sodium metabisulfite (MBS) is used as a preservative in food and wine and frequently triggers attacks of asthma. To determine the characteristics of responses to inhaled MBS, 30 asthmatic subjects and 16 nonasthmatic subjects inhaled MBS, in concentrations of 6.2, 12.5, 50, and 100 mg/ml, from a DeVilbiss No. 40 nebulizer (DeVilbiss Co., Somerset, PA) in doses ranging from 0.1 to 12.8 mumol. Response was measured as the dose that caused a 20% fall in FEV1 (PD20FEV1). All the asthmatic subjects responded; one of the atopic, nonasthmatic subjects responded and none of the nonatopic, nonasthmatic subjects responded. The response occurred within 1 min, and most subjects recovered to within 10% of baseline after 30 to 40 min. Dose-response curves to MBS were steep and were reproducible, within a 7-day period, to within one doubling dose, with mean PD20FEV1 values of 2.17 and 2.11 mumol in 11 subjects. There was no correlation between PD20FEV1 values to MBS and histamine, and inhalation of MBS did not enhance responses to subsequent challenge with histamine (mean PD20FEV1 to histamine was 0.65 mumol and to histamine 1 h after MBS was 0.74 mumol). Challenge with MBS (mean PD20FEV1 4.07 mumol) did not cause refractoriness to a second challenge 1 h later (mean PD20FEV1 5.39 mumol). Of 20 subjects tested, prior inhalation of 8 mg nedocromil sodium blocked the response to MBS in 15 subjects and reduced it in two others.

      "ABSTRACT Metabolic and hormonal responses to salbutamol in asthma. Evidence of beta-adrenergic overactivity?The possibility that beta-adrenergic hyposensitivity may be involved in the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma remains a controversial issue.

There was no consistent difference between the two groups in the plasma free fatty acid, glucose and potassium responses, or in the cardiovascular variables studied, but the asthmatic patients demonstrated a marked dose-dependent hyperinsulinaemic response to salbutamol. Although this phenomenon cannot be accounted for with certainty, it may be a manifestation of pancreatic beta-adrenergic overactivity which would not be in keeping with the concept of generalised hyposensitivity of beta-adrenergic mechanisms in asthma.

      "ABSTRACT Superoxide generation by hypodense eosinophils from patients with asthma.Low density, or hypodense eosinophils (HE) are found in increased numbers in asthma. Since HE have been reported to have increased inflammatory potential and correlate with the severity of airway obstruction, it has been suggested that this subpopulation of eosinophils may contribute to the asthma process. However, investigations to define the function of HE in asthma have been limited. In this study, pure populations of both HE and normal dense eosinophils were isolated from the peripheral blood of seven patients with asthma, and functional activity of these cells was determined by measuring superoxide (O2-) generation to several activators. Compared to normal dense eosinophils, HE generated significantly more O2- when activated with the chemotactic peptide FMLP or opsonized zymosan; however, these differences were small. In contrast, no difference was observed in O2- production between normal- and low-density eosinophils from asthma patients when stimulated by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or the calcium ionophore A23187. Furthermore, both eosinophil populations, and corresponding neutrophil isolates, from asthma patients generated significantly more O2- than control granulocytes when activated by PMA. When stimulated by calcium ionophore, all three eosinophil populations released equivalent amounts of O2-, which were, however, higher than from both neutrophil suspensions. Compared to increased activity found in some other hypereosinophilic conditions, blood HE in asthma do not necessarily have enhanced function. This suggests that eosinophil heterogeneity extends not only to cell density but is also reflected in cell function and that these cell variations are dependent on many factors, including the function assessed, source of cells (normal versus patients with some diseases), and stimulus used.\n",

Increase in receptor density and prevention of agonist-induced down-regulation.The density (Bmax) and affinity (KD) of beta 2-adrenoceptors in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) were measured in 29 children and juveniles with mild or moderate asthma and in 25 healthy control subjects using the highly specific radioligand (+/-)-125I-cyanopindolol. No significant difference in Bmax was found between asthmatic subjects without medication and the control group. The asthmatic subjects were divided into four different groups by their actual medication: no medication, adrenergics, theophylline, adrenergics plus theophylline. Analysis of variance revealed highly significant differences between these groups for Bmax (P = 0.0016) but not for KD. In asthmatics on adrenergic therapy Bmax was significantly lower (995 +/- 415) than in asthmatics without medication (1660 +/- 521; P = 0.008). In contrast, Bmax in asthmatics on theophylline therapy was significantly higher (2137 +/- 231; P = 0.009) than in the controls. Bmax was average in the group of asthmatics treated with both adrenergics and theophylline (1619 +/- 547).

Three previously exposed workers, three non-exposed non-asthmatic controls, and three non-exposed asthmatic controls were challenged with SINOS 0.01-100 micrograms and another chemically similar surface active detergent ingredient, linear alkyl benzene sulphonate (LAS) 0.01-100 micrograms. Asthmatic symptoms, late falls in FEV1, and increases in non-specific bronchial responsiveness were seen after the inhalation of SINOS in all three workers, confirming SINOS as a cause of occupational asthma. No changes were seen after the inhalation of SINOS in either group of control subjects nor after LAS in any subject. These findings suggest that SINOS causes asthma through a specific hypersensitivity mechanism unrelated to its surface active properties.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Platelet role in pathogenesis of atopic and nonimmunologic asthma.Platelet activating factor (PAF) holds the leading role among allergy mediators in pathogenesis of bronchial asthma. PAF ability to induce bronchospasms is manifested in the presence of intact platelets. Platelet function in patients with atopic and nonimmunologic aspirin-induced asthma was investigated. Aggregation increase (platelet activation) correlating with IgE level and mediator release from target cells of I order was stated to be the most important component of pathologic process in atopy. Under the influence of aggregation inducers (ADP and adrenaline) in platelets of patients with atopic asthma the level of cAMP is reduced, greater amounts of TxB2 and PGF2 alpha are produced. In cyclo-oxygenase blockade their production is not stopped. The decrease of platelet ability to aggregate is observed in patients with nonimmunologic aspirin-induced asthma. In non-stimulated platelets high levels of PGF2 alpha and TxB2 are noted. Their production is somewhat reduced and cAMP level is elevated during action of aggregation inducers on platelets preincubated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Metabolism disorder of membrane phospholipids affects platelet activity to fix Ig and to decrease receptor accessibility for action of aggregation inducers. Efficacy of therapy by different anti-allergic drugs depends greatly on the drug ability to normalize platelet function. Analysis of platelet functions is of great importance for diagnosis of atopic and nonimmunologic forms of bronchial asthma and for choice of adequate therapy.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Decreased neutral endopeptidases: possible role in inflammatory diseases of airways.Neutral endopeptidase exists on the membranes of many cells in the airways. By cleaving and thus inactivating tachykinins released from sensory nerves, NEP limits the actions of these peptides. The selectivity of the enzyme is due, at least in part, to its close association with tachykinin receptors. By cleaving and inactivating the tachykinins, it limits the concentration of tachykinin that reaches the receptor. Decreased NEP activity produced by selective enzyme inhibitors, air pollutants, infections, and oxidants leads to exaggerated neurogenic inflammation. We speculate that the multiple stimuli that enter the airways of healthy individuals normally produce small, nonsymptomatic neurogenic inflammatory responses. However, when NEP activity is decreased, the responses become exaggerated and may contribute to the pathogenesis of diseases such as asthma and bronchitis.\n",

Lung function (FEV1) was significantly improved in the BD group. In the NS group there was also a significant reduction in concomitant use of inhaled beta 2-agonists. Overall opinions of efficacy by clinicians and patients were significantly in favor of both active treatments over placebo.

      "ABSTRACT Patients' perception of distress due to symptoms and effects of asthma on daily living and an investigation of possible influential factors.1. Distress ratings for questions relating to the symptoms and impacts of asthma on daily living have been examined in 40 adult asthmatic outpatients. 2. The patients responded to each item in a 76-item questionnaire by marking a 10 cm visual analogue scale to indicate the degree of distress associated with the symptoms or state described in the question. The resulting score (as a percentage of 10 cm) was interpreted as the degree of distress associated with a particular item. 3. The possible influence on these distress scores of five factors, age, duration (time in years from diagnosis to interview), variability [recorded variability of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) expressed as amplitude per cent mean], sex and FEV1 (current and worst recorded in the clinic, expressed as per cent of predicted) was investigated. 4. From correlations of each item with age, 11/76 items were significant at P less than 0.05. Taking the results from all 76 items in a repeated measures analysis of variance, there was a small significant relationship between age and distress score (P = 0.048). The direction of the association was negative, suggesting that younger patients were less tolerant of asthma; however, the effect of age only explained 1.5% of the total variance in scores of the 76 items. 5. From correlations of visual analogue scale score for each item against duration, 10/76 items were significant at P less than 0.05, but taking the 76 items overall there was no significant association (P = 0.2). 6. The remaining factors, sex, variability and FEV1, only showed a significant effect in 1/76, 1/76 and 5/76 items, respectively (P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "ABSTRACT Bronchoalveolar lavage and morphology of the airways after cessation of exposure in asthmatic subjects sensitized to toluene diisocyanate.To evaluate the morphologic basis of the different outcomes of toluene diisocyanate (TDI) asthma after quitting occupational exposure, we examined ten patients with TDI asthma who showed, at diagnosis, a positive TDI challenge test and nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness (NSBH) to methacholine. After diagnosis, all patients ceased work and a 4- to 40-month follow-up was obtained with three to eight determinations of the cumulative dose producing a 15 percent fall in FEV1 (PD15FEV1) methacholine in each patient. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and biopsy of bronchial muscosa were performed 3 to 39 months after cessation of work, in the absence of acute exacerbations of the disease. Total cell count in BAL fluid was moderately increased in four of ten patients, eosinophils were increased in five of ten patients, and neutrophils were increased in eight of ten patients. Mucosal biopsy specimens of main or lobar bronchi were available in eight of ten patients; epithelial damage and thickening of basement membrane was observed in almost all patients, as well as a mild-to-moderate inflammatory reaction in the submucosa, mainly represented by lymphocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophils. No relationship was observed between the cellularity of BAL and the degree of NSBH at the time of BAL; mean values of total cells and differential count were not different between patients with presence or absence of the different histologic findings. Mucosal biopsy and BAL were performed also in four subjects exposed to dusts without respiratory symptoms or NSBH; similar findings were obtained except for the absence of eosinophils in BAL and a lesser degree of basement membrane thickening and inflammatory reaction in the submucosa. The study of the changes in NSBH after quitting exposure showed that five of ten patients had a significant improvement in NSBH to methacholine, as evaluated by a positive significant linear regression between months of work cessation and PD15FEV1 methacholine; only one of these five patients had an increased number of eosinophils in BAL fluid. By contrast, four of the five patients with persistent NSBH after quitting exposure had an increased number of eosinophils in BAL. We suggest that persistent NSBH in TDI asthma after cessation of work may be related to an inflammatory reaction in which eosinophil infiltration seems to be a major determinant.\n",

Leukotriene B4 was detected in all five individuals, and its identity was confirmed by a combination of high pressure liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay techniques. The concentration of leukotriene B4 was 48.34 +/- 16.27 pg ml-1 (mean value +/- SE). However, in five control subjects the leukotriene B4 concentration was found to be 9.43 +/- 5.44 pg ml-1. Thus there was a significant difference between the two groups (P less than 0.05).

The time course of recovery of reduced beta-adrenoceptors caused by ovalbumin (OA) challenge was investigated using guinea-pigs. 2. The effects of prednisolone on the recovery time course were also evaluated. 3. beta- and alpha 1-receptor assays were performed using lung membranes. Adenylate cyclase activity was also measured. 4. OA challenge reduced the number of beta-adrenoceptors by 35%, and a significant decrease (13%) persisted for 7 days. The number of beta-adrenoceptor recovered after 14 days. 5. OA challenge elevated the number of alpha 1-adrenoceptors. A significant increase (24%) was observed after 7 days, and it took a further 7 days for the recovery. 6. After OA challenge there was a significant decrease in adenylate cyclase activity after 7 days, which recovered after a further 7 days. 7. Inhalation of prednisolone accelerated the recovery of beta-adrenergic responsiveness, though it did not affect the recovery of the number of alpha 1-adrenoceptors. Prednisolone inhalation also elevated beta-adrenergic responsiveness in non-asthmatic subjects. 8. It is concluded that reduced beta-adrenergic responsiveness caused by OA challenge persisted for 7 days and recovered after a further 7 days. Steroid hormone increased beta-adrenoceptors.\n",

Material which competed with [11, 12-3H]tetranor LTE4 for binding to this antisera was isolated from urine from allergic asthmatics by reversed-phase HPLC. This material eluted with the retention time of synthetic standards, and its mean urinary excretion was elevated during both the first three hours (6.13 +/- 2.15 ng/h) and 3-6 h (5.87 +/- 1.99 ng/h) after antigen inhalation, compared with baseline values (3.42 +/- 1.49 ng/h), in 5 allergic mild asthmatics. A much greater and statistically significant increase in urinary leukotriene E4 (LTE4) excretion, occurring in all subjects, was seen during acute antigen-induced bronchoconstriction (baseline, 1.62 +/- 0.66 ng/h; 0-3 h, 19.58 +/- 8.79 ng/h; p less than 0.05) in these subjects. These data support the suggestion that endogenous peptide leukotrienes are metabolised by omega- and subsequent beta-oxidation in man, but emphasize the relative importance of urinary LTE4 excretion after allergen elicited leukotriene generation, further substantiating a pathological role for peptide leukotrienes in allergic asthma.\n",

The glucose-oxidase method was used for the determination of glucose levels in peripheral blood. Glucose serum levels in normal children were significantly higher at 30 and 60 minutes compared with basal values. In patients with mild and moderate asthma, significantly higher values were observed only at 30 minutes. In severe asthmatics, the glucose levels at 30 minutes were not different from the basal values, but higher than those observed at 60 minutes. Comparison among the four groups showed significant differences between the nonatopic normal children and the severe asthmatic children at 30 and 60 minutes.

      "ABSTRACT Effect of facial cooling on mucosal blood flow in the mouth in humans.1. To determine the effects of facial cooling on intraoral thermal events, we placed a thermal conductivity sensor on the buccal surface of the left cheek in six normal and six asthmatic subjects. Room temperature and cold stimuli were then applied to the integument surface of both sides of the face while mucosal surface temperature and thermal conductivity, as an index of blood flow, were recorded. 2. The room temperature challenge had no effect. Application of the cold stimulus to the exterior of the left cheek caused a monotonic decrease in temperature in the mouth in all subjects and was associated with a change in thermal conductivity in which blood flow increased and then fell to baseline despite a continued drop in temperature. These responses were purely local in that cooling of the right side of the face did not change the temperature or blood flow on the left side. No differences were noted between the asthmatic and normal subjects. 3. The data indicate that lowering the temperature of the skin of the face produces significant alterations in the thermal environment within the mouth. With facial cooling, buccal temperature falls and mucosal blood supply transiently rises. This effect appears to be a purely local thermally mediated event. Facial pressure and cutaneous reflexes do not play a role. The above changes may contribute to the conditioning of inspired air during oral breathing.\n",

Patients who took the active drug had an improvement in symptoms from the 3rd week of observation and a significative decrease in bronchodilators' consumption. The judgement about the treatment's efficiency was different between physician and patients thus preventing the recognition of the patients who had taken Nedocromil from those who had taken placebo.

All were receiving daily or alternate-day prednisone. These patients had taken part in an earlier, 12-week double-blind trial of nedocromil sodium 16 mg daily by inhalation or matching placebo. They continued with test treatment (26 patients on nedocromil sodium and 11 on placebo) on a double-blind basis for a further 12 weeks. During this time, patients visited the clinic every 2 weeks, when asthma severity and symptoms were assessed. On the basis of these assessments, the dose of oral steroid was either decreased, or maintained at the same level, or the patient was withdrawn if the asthma had deteriorated to a clinically unacceptable level. The nedocromil sodium group was able to achieve a greater percentage reduction in oral steroid dose (P less than 0.05). The rate of withdrawal due to worsening asthma was 31% from active and 55% from placebo treatment. Trends in other variables (time before withdrawal and numbers of patients able to withstand complete removal of oral steroids) favoured nedocromil sodium but the differences between the groups were not statistically significant.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Asthmatic airways have a disproportionate hyperresponsiveness to LTE4, as compared with normal airways, but not to LTC4, LTD4, methacholine, and histamine.Airways responsiveness to leukotriene (LT) C4, LTD4, LTE4, histamine, and methacholine have been studied in eight asthmatic and six normal subjects. Airways responsiveness to each bronchoconstrictor agonist was assessed by constructing cumulative dose-response curves, and the dose that produced a 35% decrease in specific airways conductance (PD35) was obtained by linear interpolation. Airways of subjects with asthma were approximately 14-, 15-, 6-, 9-, and 219-fold more responsive to histamine, methacholine, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4, respectively, than were normal subjects. Thus, there was a substantially augmented level of hyperresponsiveness to LTE4 in bronchial asthma, which was not observed for the other bronchoconstrictor agents, when compared to normal subjects. In contrast to LTC4 and LTD4, as histamine and methacholine responsiveness increase, the dose ratio of histamine to LTE4 (PD35 histamine/PD35 LTE4) and the dose ratio of methacholine to LTE4 also tended to increase. This suggests that as the nonspecific airways responsiveness increases, the relative potency of LTE4 also increases, whereas potency of LTC4 and LTD4 decrease. These results suggest that the mechanism of the bronchoconstriction induced by LTE4 may be distinct from that produced by LTC4 or LTD4 in subjects with asthma. This may reflect leukotriene subtype receptor heterogeneity in asthmatic airways.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Decrease of beta-receptors after the antigen-specific bronchial provocation test in bronchial asthma.Airway hyperreactivity to different stimuli is a characteristic feature of bronchial asthma. The beta-adrenergic theory, as proposed by Szentivanyi in 1968, tried to explain with beta-adrenergic dysfunction, the cause not only of bronchial hyperreactivity but of all atopic diseases. In a previous work, we found that asymptomatic asthmatic patients presented a number of beta-receptors similar to that of a normal control group, while symptomatic asthmatic patients presented a significantly decreased number when compared to both groups (40% decrease). In view of these results, we proposed to study the possible changes in the number of beta-receptors in asymptomatic asthmatic patients after a bronchial provocation test. Fifteen patients, diagnosed of bronchial asthma and sensitive to the house dust mite, D. pteronyssinus, were studied. All were free of medication and asymptomatic at least 90 days before the study. A test of specific bronchial provocation was performed on 10 patients, determining the number of beta-receptors in basal conditions, after 30 minutes and 24 hours. The other five patients underwent an unspecific provocation test with methacholine, with determination of the beta-receptor number at basal conditions, and 24 hours later. Only a significant decrease (30.4%) was found in the beta-receptor numbers, 24 hours after specific bronchial provocation with p less than 0.025 with the Student test for paired data. With regards the beta-adrenergic theory of atopy, in our opinion our results show that the detected decrease of beta-receptors would be the consequence and not the cause of atopic diseases.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Comparative airway response to inhaled bradykinin, kallidin, and [des-Arg9]bradykinin in normal and asthmatic subjects.Bradykinin, kallidin (lys-bradykinin), and [des-Arg9]bradykinin are oligopeptides that may contribute as mediators in the pathogenesis of asthma by interacting with specific receptors designated B1 and B2. In this study, we have investigated the airway response to inhaled bradykinin, kallidin, and [des-Arg9]bradykinin in normal and asthmatic subjects. Changes in airway caliber were followed as maximum expiratory flow at 30% of the vital capacity (Vp30) and as forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1). Only one of the six normal subjects responded to bradykinin at the maximum cumulative concentration (5.33 mg/ml). Neither kallidin nor [des-Arg9]bradykinin had any measurable bronchoconstrictor effect in the normal subjects whether airway caliber was measured as Vp30 or FEV1. In the 10 subjects with asthma, bradykinin and kallidin, but not [des-Arg9]bradykinin, produced a concentration-related fall in FEV1. The geometric mean provocation concentrations of inhaled agonist reducing FEV1 by 20% of baseline were 0.03, 0.08, and 0.44 mg/ml for bradykinin, kallidin, and histamine, respectively. Bronchoconstriction produced by bradykinin and kallidin was maximal within 3 to 5 min with recovery occurring over 30 to 45 min. Because bradykinin and kallidin are agonists of B2 receptors and [des-Arg9]bradykinin is an agonist for B1 receptors, these in vivo structure activity studies suggest that asthmatic, but not normal, airways are hyperresponsive to kinins when compared to histamine and that this potent bronchoconstrictor action is a specific pharmacologic effect compatible with the stimulation of B2 receptors or a variant of these.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Alpha- and beta-adrenergic-receptor systems in bronchial asthma and in subjects without asthma: reduced mononuclear cell beta-receptors in bronchial asthma.We assessed the adrenergic-receptor system in individuals with bronchial hyperreactivity, beta-Adrenergic receptors on mononuclear cell membranes, alpha-adrenergic receptors on platelet membranes, and the cAMP response in these cell types to different stimuli, including platelet-activating factor (PAF), were determined. Studies were assessed in 10 subjects with mild asthma, six methacholine-sensitive subjects without asthma, and 10 normal subjects. The density and affinity of beta-receptors and alpha-receptors were determined by Scatchard analysis. Our findings were that (1) subjects with asthma had a significantly lower density of beta-receptors compared to normal subjects, (2) subjects with asthma had a significantly lower cAMP response to isoproterenol stimulation compared to the two other groups, (3) in subjects without asthma. PAF decreased the basal cAMP level and significantly inhibited the response to isoproterenol stimulation, (4) there was no difference in density and affinity of platelet alpha-receptors or in platelet cAMP responses to stimulation by alpha-agonists among these three groups, and (5) neither cAMP response or beta-receptor density on mononuclear cells were significantly correlated with pulmonary-function tests (FEV/FVC times 100), sensitivity to methacholine, or cold-air inhalation. These results suggest that patients with asthma may have a lower isoproterenol cAMP response and decreased density of beta-adrenergic receptors on mononuclear cells in the absence of beta-agonist therapy. It is speculated that release of PAF and other mediators secondary to allergen exposure, even in the absence of overt attacks of asthma, may inhibit the response to endogenous or exogenous beta-adrenergic agonists.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Activity of angiotensin I converting enzyme in sarcoidosis, atopic bronchial asthma and acute bronchitis.The lungs have an important role in the synthesis of ACE. In BAL fluid and serum the ACE activity was determined in 18 patients with sarcoidosis (11 with high intensity and 7 with low intensity alveolitis), 25 patients with atopic bronchial asthma and 17 with acute bronchitis. The activity of ACE was examined by a reagent set produced by Boehringer Mannheim Biochemica Test-Combination ACE cat. no. 789 011. In the high intensity alveolitis group of sarcoidosis patients the ACE activity was significantly increased in BAL fluid and serum in comparison to other observed patients. On the other hand, in patients with atopic bronchial asthma the ACE activity was also increased in comparison to acute bronchitis and referred norms. These findings suggest a role of atopic processes or administered therapy in ACE secretion in the airways.\n",

The level of TxB2 was significantly higher in 18 asthmatics with attacks than that in 11 controls (77.3 +/- 48.8 pg/ml vs 48.8 +/- 9.4 pgml). The levels of 6-keto PGF1 alpha in both asthmatics with attacks (17.8 +/- 6.7 pg/ml) and without an attack (16.4 +/- 9.7) were significantly higher than that in controls (11.6 +/- 3.9 pg/ml). The levels of LTC4 in asthmatics with attacks (0.84 +/- 0.11 ng/ml, n = 11) were significantly higher than that in controls, furthermore the level of LTC4 in asthmatics without an attack. The level of LTB4 was significantly higher in asthmatics with attacks (295.0 +/- 160.7 pg/ml, n = 26) than that in controls (161.7 +/- 25.3 pg/ml, n = 12) and asthmatics without an attack (182.4 +/- 97.9 pg/ml, n = 22).

Seventeen subjects were entered into a 2-week baseline phase, and subsequently in a double-blind crossover fashion into two 8-week phases of daily BDP or NDS. Subjects recorded daily peak expiratory flow rates, morning and evening (PEF am and pm), symptom scores and beta-2-agonist inhaler use. Thirteen subjects completed the study and the last 2 weeks of each phase were analysed. Compared to baseline, both BDP and NDS caused a significant improvement in PEF am (P less than 0.05), PEF pm (P less than 0.05) and the 'amplitude % mean' (P less than 0.001). Both drugs gave a highly significant improvement in all symptom scores. There was no significant difference between BDP and NDS for PEF am, PEF pm, amplitude % mean, cough and daytime asthma score. However, beta-2-agonist inhaler use and scores for nocturnal asthma and morning tightness were all significantly better in the BDP phase, and may have contributed to its better overall subjective performance. Thus, both NDS and BDP resulted in a significant improvement in asthma control in the subjects studied, and both drugs caused a similar improvement in PEF.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of topical corticosteroid derivatives used for asthma therapy.Although systemic corticosteroids provide additional therapeutic benefit for persons with refractory asthma, their side effects make them less than optimal agents. Introduction of beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP), the first corticosteroid that is clinically useful when delivered by aerosol, provided a major advance in asthma therapy. Patients who were previously maintained on daily systemic steroids could be transferred to inhaled steroids with no loss of medical benefit and significant improvement in the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The value of BDP and subsequent topical corticosteroids lies in their pharmacologic properties. These agents possess increased intrinsic potency when administered by inhaler. At the same time they have considerably lower systemic potency than corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone and dexamethasone in aerosol form. This is because the fraction of the topically useful compounds that is swallowed, which is substantial, is rapidly inactivated by first-pass metabolism in the liver. Absorption of unmetabolized drug through the pulmonary circulation accounts for most of the systemic effect of topical corticosteroids. Use of spacers in the aerosol delivery device can further increase the efficacy of these substances, or allow lowering of the dose.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Effect of corticosteroids on airway hyperresponsiveness.Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) and asthma symptoms are linked to chronic inflammation in the airway. Corticosteroids reduce BHR and asthma symptoms and, although their precise mode of action is not yet certain, it is likely that they suppress the allergic inflammatory response. They may act on macrophages, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and airway microvascular leak to inhibit the late response and BHR that follows allergen exposure, whereas chronic administration may also reduce the number of mast cells in airways to decrease the immediate response to allergen and exercise. In view of the safety of administration, inhaled corticosteroids should be considered as first line therapy for chronic asthma, with the aim of suppressing inflammation and reducing the need for bronchodilator therapy.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Complications of topical steroid therapy for asthma.The oropharyngeal complications of IS therapy are seldom a serious problem. They may be avoided or ameliorated by inhaling the drug via a spacer and/or reducing the dosing frequency. Severe esophageal candidiasis or atrophic glossitis are rare and generally require discontinuation of IS therapy. Reflex cough or bronchospasm triggered by the inhaled drug occur fairly commonly, but are easily corrected by appropriate treatment. The systemic complications of IS therapy are inconsequential in most patients treated with conventional low doses. Higher doses are more effective but also more active systemically. Despite this, the ratio of systemic-to-antiasthmatic activities may be more favorable with high dose IS than with oral prednisone when the two treatments are compared at equivalent levels of asthma response. The potential risk of adverse systemic effects accruing from the long-term use of intermediate or high doses of IS needs to be rigorously studied.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of multiple doses of azelastine to adult patients with bronchial asthma over time.Azelastine is a new oral antiasthma agent with bronchodilating and antiallergic properties. This 12-wk study compared azelastine (2, 4, 6, and 8 mg) and placebo given twice a day in asthmatics 12 to 60 yr of age requiring daily bronchodilator therapy. Patients were allowed albuterol aerosol, short-acting theophylline, and pseudoephedrine only as needed. The study was completed by 221 asthmatic subjects. No significant differences in symptoms, medication, or pulmonary function existed between groups at baseline. Analysis of the zero hour FEV1 before azelastine administration on eight occasions during the 12 wk of therapy indicated an increasing slope for azelastine 6 mg that was statistically different from that of placebo; similarly, the slope for azelastine 4 mg showed the same trend, but it did not reach statistical significance. All azelastine groups had significant reductions of as-needed medication after 1 wk; only in the 4-mg and 6-mg groups was this reduction sustained for 12 wk. Asthma symptom scores and peak expiratory flow measurements remained stable in the azelastine groups despite significant reductions in concomitant medication administration. Side effects were minor and included: altered taste (30.1 to 51.9%), drowsiness (6.0 to 16.9%), and dry mouth (3.8 to 6.1%).

      "ABSTRACT Effects of sequential doses of parenteral terbutaline on plasma levels of potassium and related cardiopulmonary responses.beta-agonist bronchodilator drugs are known to cause hypokalemia; nevertheless, successive parenteral doses are recommended for the treatment of status asthmaticus. The metabolic and cardiopulmonary effects of sequential, subcutaneous doses of terbutaline were studied in eight stable adult asthmatic patients. Each subject received terbutaline, 0.25 mg subcutaneously, followed 30 min later either by a second subcutaneous dose of terbutaline (sequential) or normal saline (single) in a randomized, double-blind, crossover fashion. Maximum reductions in plasma potassium from baseline were significantly greater (p less than 0.05) following sequential treatment compared to single treatment (-1.1 versus -0.6 mEq/L, respectively). Improvements in forced expiratory volume in 1 s were temporally related to changes in serum potassium and were significantly greater (p less than 0.01) following sequential terbutaline treatment. Prolongation of the QTc interval occurred following both treatment regimens. The change in QTc was statistically significant only following sequential treatment, increasing from 377 +/- 21 to 441 +/- 39 ms (p less than 0.05). Sequential doses of parenterally administered terbutaline result in clinically significant reductions in plasma potassium that are temporally related to changes in pulmonary function and associated with important electrocardiographic alterations.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Changes in airway resistance following nasal provocation.Controversy exists on whether stimulation of the nasal mucosa results in reflex bronchoconstriction. To address shortcomings in previous experimental design, we performed double-blind randomized nasal challenges in asthmatic patients with allergic rhinitis and in controls. Using pledgets containing 10-microliters aliquots of 0.9% saline or increasing concentrations of methacholine or histamine, we were able to increase nasal resistance significantly in both groups. Only methacholine caused an increase in lower airway resistance, and this could be blunted by premedication of the nasal mucosa with phenylephrine. This suggests that the effect on lower airway resistance was due to systemic absorption.

      "ABSTRACT Peripheral lung resistance in normal and asthmatic subjects.In obstructive lung disease, peripheral airways are a major site of pathologic abnormalities. However, resistance to airflow in small airways in the periphery of the lung accounts for only a small fraction of total airway resistance. Consequently, abnormalities of small airway function may not be readily detected using routine pulmonary function testing. In the present study, resistance of the peripheral lung was examined directly in six normal subjects and nine mildly asthmatic subjects. There were no significant differences between the normal and asthmatic groups in pulmonary function assessed by spirometry (FEV1, FVC) and body plethysmography (specific airway conductance). Direct measurements of peripheral lung function were made using a fiberoptic bronchoscope wedged into a subsegmental, right upper lobe bronchus. Using a double-lumen catheter inserted into the instrument channel of the bronchoscope, pressures (PB) produced by three or more different levels of gas flow (V) (5% CO2 in air) between 50 and 500 ml/min were measured. All pressure measurements were made at a constant lung volume (i.e., functional residual capacity) confirmed by monitoring transpulmonary pressure with an esophageal balloon. The pressure-flow relationship in both normal and asthmatic subjects could be approximated by a straight line through the origin, demonstrating these airways to be relatively nondistensible. Peripheral lung resistance (Rp) was defined by PB/V and averaged for three or more levels of flow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "ABSTRACT The major respiratory diseases of American Indians.The most prominent respiratory diseases of American Indian adults are pneumonia, cancer of the lung, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and tuberculosis. Mortality and hospitalization rates of these diseases were compared with those for the rest of the U.S. population and between Indian groups in the various Indian Health Service Areas. Pneumonia and influenza constitute the sixth leading cause of death among Indians and the fifth leading cause of death among the U.S. All Races population. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is the fourth leading cause of death among U.S. All Races, but only the tenth leading cause of death among Indians. Pneumonia and tuberculosis are more significant causes of death and disability for Indians than are COPD and cancer of the lung. The explanation for these differences in mortality rates between Indians and the general population are not known. Respiratory system diseases are responsible for 10.6% of Indian hospitalizations. The most frequent is pneumonia, which accounts for approximately 4% of all Indian hospitalizations. Differences in respiratory diseases between Indian groups are sometimes striking, with a sharp increase in mortality and hospitalization in the Areas across the northern border of the lower 48 states. There is also a much higher prevalence of cigarette smoking in those same Areas.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Chronic cough. The spectrum and frequency of causes, key components of the diagnostic evaluation, and outcome of specific therapy.A successful, systematic, anatomic, diagnostic protocol for evaluating patients with chronic cough was presented in 1981. To determine whether it was still valid, we prospectively evaluated, over a 22-month interval, 102 consecutive and unselected immunocompetent patients complaining of cough an average of 53 +/- 97 months (range, 3 wk to 50 yr). Utilizing the anatomic, diagnostic protocol modified to include prolonged esophageal pH monitoring (EPM), the causes of cough were determined in 101 of 102 (99%) patients, leading to specific therapy that was successful in 98%. Cough was due to one condition in 73%, two in 23%, and three in 3%. Postnasal drip syndrome was a cause 41% of the time, asthma 24%, gastroesophageal reflux (GER) 21%, chronic bronchitis 5%, bronchiectasis 4%, and miscellaneous conditions 5%. Cough was the sole presenting manifestation of asthma and GER 28 and 43% of the time, respectively. While history, physical examination, methacholine inhalational challenge (MIC), and EPM yielded the most frequent true positive results, MIC was falsely positive 22% of the time in predicting that asthma was the cause of cough. Laboratory testing was particularly useful in ruling out suspected possibilities. We conclude that the anatomic diagnostic protocol is still valid and that it has well-defined strengths and limitations.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The neutrophil and chronic allergic inflammation. Immunochemical localization of neutrophil elastase.To test whether neutrophils infiltrate and degranulate in areas of chronic respiratory allergic inflammation, we developed an indirect immunofluorescence technique to localize neutrophil elastase in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. The affinity-purified antielastase stained only neutrophils on peripheral blood buffy coat smears, and in lung tissue from patients with pneumonia. We examined tissue specimens from four patients with fatal asthma, 10 patients with chronic sinusitis, and 10 patients with nasal polyposis for the presence of elastase, as well as eosinophil granule major basic protein (MBP). Neutrophil infiltration and extracellular elastase deposition in association with damage to respiratory epithelium were generally sparse in most specimens; the exceptions were one patient with asthma, one patient with chronic sinusitis, and two patients with nasal polyposis. In contrast, eosinophil infiltration and extracellular MBP deposition were generally marked in most specimens; the exceptions were one patient with asthma and one patient with nasal polyps where extracellular MBP deposition did not coincide with damage to respiratory epithelium. The results suggest that the neutrophil does not usually infiltrate tissues showing allergic inflammation; however, on occasion, it may participate in these inflammatory reactions.\n",

We investigated changes in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) in response to inhaling ultrasonically nebulized 4.5% saline in 10 normal subjects and 68 subjects with asthma. A comparison of the sensitivity to this challenge was made with sensitivity to challenge with methacholine, water, exercise and eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation (EVH). In normal subjects the FEV1 was reduced by 6 +/- 2% (mean +/- SD) after inhalation of 33 ml of aerosol. Eighty four percent of the asthmatic subjects exhibited a fall in FEV1 of greater than 20% after inhaling 4.5% saline. The provoking dose (geometric mean +/- 95% confidence limits) of saline to induce a 20% fall (PD20) was 2.05 ml (1.34-4.48). The sensitivity to inhaled 4.5% saline was significantly related (p less than 0.001) with responsiveness to methacholine, exercise and EVH, but not to water. Those patients recording a PD20 to 4.5% saline had a PD20 to methacholine less than 2 mumol which is a response consistent with moderate to severe bronchial hyperresponsiveness.\n",

      "ABSTRACT High-dose inhaled versus intravenous salbutamol combined with theophylline in severe acute asthma. Swedish Society of Chest Medicine.In a multicentre parallel group study we studied 176 adult patients (53% men) with severe acute asthma (peak expiratory flow (PEF), 15-50% of predicted values). The effect of two doses of inhaled salbutamol (0.15 mg.kg-1 x 2; 30 min apart) (n = 87) was compared with that of one dose of salbutamol given intravenously (5 micrograms.kg-1) (n = 89). There was a significantly larger increase in peak expiratory flow after the first inhaled dose in the group that received inhalation treatment than in the i.v. treated group (69 vs 41 l.min-1, p less than 0.05), but there was no difference in systemic side-effects between the groups. After the second inhaled dose there was a further increase in PEF, but also in systemic side-effects. These treatments were also compared in a cross-over study on 18 of the patients who returned with a second attack of severe acute asthma. The cross-over evaluation produced similar results, with a significantly larger increase in PEF after the first inhaled dose than after the i.v. treatment. Fifteen of the 18 patients found the inhalations more effective than the i.v. treatment. Theophylline (3-6 mg.kg-1) was infused i.v. 60 min after the start of salbutamol treatment, and a significant increase in PEF was observed in both groups. A correlation between the increase in PEF and the increase in plasma theophylline concentration was only found in the group that had received i.v. salbutamol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "ABSTRACT Efficacy of sustained release theophylline given at three different evening intake times in addition to a baseline medication.In this randomized crossover study of 26 outpatients with bronchial asthma the efficacy of a new once-daily theophylline formulation given in addition to a baseline medication was investigated; moreover, under steady state conditions, the effect of three evening intake times (6, 8 and 10 p.m.) on 24 h pharmacokinetics and peak-expiratory flow profiles was evaluated. The theophylline dose had been individually titrated. The pharmacodynamic results show a marked improvement of 24 h peak expiratory flow values after adding theophylline to a drug therapy including inhalative beta 2-agonists and corticosteroids in nearly all and inhalative anticholinergics in 50% of the treated outpatients. No significant differences between the pharmacokinetic characteristics and the 24 hr averages (mesors) of peak expiratory flow at the three different intake times 6, 8 and 10 p.m. were found; however, intake at 10 p.m. resulted in the highest nocturnal excess of serum theophylline concentrations and the highest peak expiratory flow during the early morning hours between 2 and 6 a.m.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Metal toxicity and the respiratory tract.The type of lung disease caused by metal compounds depends on the nature of the offending agent, its physicochemical form, the dose, exposure conditions and host factors. The fumes or gaseous forms of several metals, e.g. cadmium (Cd), manganese (Mn), mercury (Hg), nickel carbonyl (Nl(CO)4, zinc chloride (ZnCl2), vanadium pentoxide (V2O5), may lead to acute chemical pneumonitis and pulmonary oedema or to acute tracheobronchitis. Metal fume fever, which may follow the inhalation of metal fumes e.g. zinc (Zn), copper (Cu) and many others, is a poorly understood influenza-like reaction, accompanied by an acute self-limiting neutrophil alveolitis. Chronic obstructive lung disease may result from occupational exposure to mineral dusts, including probably some metallic dusts, or from jobs involving the working of metal compounds, such as welding. Exposure to cadmium may lead to emphysema. Bronchial asthma may be caused by complex platinum salts, nickel, chromium or cobalt, presumably on the basis of allergic sensitization. The cause of asthma in aluminium workers is unknown. It is remarkable that asthma induced by nickel (Ni) or chromium (Cr) is apparently infrequent, considering their potency and frequent involvement as dermal sensitizers. Metallic dusts deposited in the lung may give rise to pulmonary fibrosis and functional impairment, depending on the fibrogenic potential of the agent and on poorly understood host factors. Inhalation of iron compounds causes siderosis, a pneumoconiosis with little or no fibrosis. Hard metal lung disease is a fibrosis characterized by desquamative and giant cell interstitial pneumonitis and is probably caused by cobalt, since a similar disease has been observed in workers exposed to cobalt in the absence of tungsten carbide. Chronic beryllium disease is a fibrosis with sarcoid-like epitheloid granulomas and is presumably due to a cell-mediated immune response to beryllium. Such a mechanism may be responsible for the pulmonary fibrosis occasionally found in subjects exposed to other metals e.g. aluminium (Al), titanium (Ti), rare earths. The proportion of lung cancer attributable to occupation is around 15%, with exposure to metals being frequently incriminated. Underground mining of e.g. uranium or iron is associated with a high incidence of lung cancer, as a result of exposure to radon. At least some forms of arsenic, chromium and nickel are well established lung carcinogens in humans. There is also evidence for increased lung cancer mortality in cadmium workers and in iron or steel workers.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Does non-specific bronchial responsiveness indicate the severity of asthma?It is difficult to analyse the relationship between bronchial responsiveness and the severity of asthma since each alone is difficult to assess. Asthma is a heterogeneous condition with many patterns of expression, and clinical methods used to assess its severity have their limitations. Problems also arise in interpreting the results of bronchial provocation tests and methodological differences make comparisons between studies difficult. The findings of both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have shown a general relationship between the degree of responsiveness and the severity of asthma, but within subjects the relationship is weaker. A greater understanding must await increased knowledge of the mechanisms underlying asthma and the contribution which hyperresponsiveness makes to each of these.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Sensitivity and specificity of PC20 and peak expiratory flow rate in cedar asthma.The diagnosis of red cedar asthma is usually confirmed by a specific challenge with plicatic acid, the compound responsible for the disease. We performed this study to determine the sensitivity and specificity of two other diagnostic tests, prolonged recording expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and measurement of bronchial responsiveness (provocative dose of methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 [PC20 methacholine]). Twenty-three patients with suspected cedar asthma participated in the study. The patients recorded PEFR during 2 weeks away from work and 3 weeks at work. PC20 was measured both at the end of the nonworking and working period. An obvious decrease in PEFR in 2 of 3 working weeks, when PEFRs of weekends or holidays were compared (by visual inspection of the PEFR recording), and a decrease in PC20 by more than a twofold dilution, when the patient returned to work, were considered as positive tests for cedar asthma. Plicatic acid challenge test was performed at the end of the study; 14 patients reacted, whereas nine patients did not. With the results of the plicatic acid challenge test as the gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity of PEFR recordings were 86% and 89%; changes in PC20, 62% and 78%; and 93% and 45% for a positive clinical history. The combination of PEFR and clinical history revealed a 100% sensitivity with a 45% specificity.

      "ABSTRACT Ambulatory long-term subcutaneous salbutamol infusion in chronic severe asthma.Although most patients with asthma improve with currently available drugs, there appears to be a subset of patients with asthma resistant to intensive treatment, including large doses of systemic corticosteroids. In 10 patients with asthma difficult to treat, a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study was performed to evaluate whether long-term, continuous subcutaneous infusion of large doses of salbutamol, in addition to steroids, could improve pulmonary function, compared with intermittent nebulization of salbutamol. Four weeks of administration of large doses (greater than 14 mg/day) of beta 2-agonists were well tolerated, elicited a significant decrease of corticosteroid consumption (p less than 0.01), and were associated with an improvement in pulmonary function (p less than 0.01), compared with run in or the placebo administration period. Mean morning and evening peak expiratory flow rates were similar during all periods, and the variability between morning and evening peak expiratory flow rates was only slightly and nonsignificantly reduced during the period when salbutamol was administered subcutaneously. Both nebulized and subcutaneous salbutamol elicited similar metabolic and muscular side effects, but these untoward reactions never caused any patient to stop the treatment. Local infection at the injection site was observed in two of 10 patients with continuous subcutaneous infusion. Tachyphylaxis to beta 2-agonist, as measured by the reversibility of FEV1 to inhaled salbutamol 12 hours after the end of each period, did not occur. In conclusion, large doses of beta 2-agonist administered to patients with severe, chronic, and steroid-dependent asthma were able to improve respiratory function and to decrease corticosteroids requirements.\n",

One hundred twenty-four adolescent and adult patients with asthma and with chronic reversible obstructive airway disease were studied. All patients qualified with an FEV1 less than or equal to 80% of predicted (not receiving treatment) and greater than or equal to 15% reversibility in FEV1 or greater than or equal to 25% reversibility in FEF25-75% after inhaled isoproterenol. All patients were known to be able to take theophylline without unacceptable adverse effects. Theophylline was titrated for patients to receive, unblinded, theophylline serum concentrations of 10 to 20 micrograms/ml. With subsequent randomization, 62 patients continued to receive theophylline and 62 patients started taking albuterol in the 12-week, double-blind, double-dummy portion of the study. Pulmonary function was measured during a pretreatment visit (unmedicated) and serial assessment was made starting just before the morning dose and continuing for 12 hours after the dose at the end of 1, 6, and 12 weeks of treatment. Both treatment groups exhibited statistically significant increases in FEV1 from the pretreatment visit to all times of observation at weeks 1, 6, and 12. The increases in FEV1 were not significantly different between albuterol and theophylline administration. There was no evidence of tolerance to the bronchodilatory effect during 12 weeks in either treatment group. Only one patient in the study stopped treatment because of an adverse effect. This patient had tremor during albuterol administration. All other adverse events were tolerated or resolved during treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

The increase in airflow obstruction overnight is underassessed by children as well as their parents. Worsening of the early morning peak flow values may be an indication for an increase in airflow obstruction overnight. An increase in vagal activity does not, in contrast with the observations in adult patients, contribute to the development of nocturnal airflow obstruction in asthmatic children. However, a nocturnal increase in inflammatory mediators seems to play a role of importance. Treatment of nocturnal airflow obstruction should therefore be focussed on inflammatory processes in the lungs.\n",

Outgrowing childhood asthma is especially estimated by: the degree of airway obstruction as a child, and the degree of bronchial hyperreactivity in childhood. Another childhood factor of influence on the prognosis of asthma seems to be the combined early and late bronchial response after inhalation of an allergen. Factors not predicting the outcome of childhood asthma are: at what age asthma symptoms started; whether the child with asthma had eczema or not, and how strong skin-allergy was. Conceivable risk-factors for the outcome of childhood asthma are: smoking of the parents and a strong degree of eosinophilia. The prognosis of asthma might be improved by more intensive treatment and continuity in treatment of the children with an increased risk.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The 1987 forest fire disaster in California: assessment of emergency room visits.During a 5-d period that commenced on August 30, 1987, dry lightning strikes ignited more than 1,500 fires that destroyed in excess of 600,000 acres of California forests. To evaluate the public health impact of the smoke on the general population, all hospital emergency rooms located in the six counties most severely affected by smoke or fire were surveyed. Selected hospital information was abstracted for a 2 1/2-wk period during the fires and during two reference periods. During the period of major forest fire activity, visits of persons with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease increased in number (observed/expected ratios of 1.4 and 1.3, respectively), as did visits of persons with sinusitis, upper respiratory infections, and laryngitis. A few patients with acute respiratory or eye irritation also visited the emergency rooms. Even recognizing the limited sensitivity of emergency room surveys, the overall public health impact was relatively modest. The increased respiratory morbidity detected in this survey, however, supports the notion that persons with pre-existing respiratory disease represent a sensitive subpopulation, who should be targeted for purposes of public health intervention when exposure to forest fire smoke is likely.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Corticosteroids in asthma.The use of corticosteroids in the treatment of asthma has significantly decreased the morbidity and mortality from this disease. However, corticosteroids have devastating side effects when given frequently or for prolonged periods. High doses of systemic corticosteroid preparations should be used only during bouts of acute bronchospasm, whereas the lowest possible dose needed to control symptoms is recommended for the treatment of chronic asthma. Aerosolized steroids offer an alternative to systemic preparations and have less associated morbidity. Various corticosteroid preparations have various potencies and durations of action that need to be considered. Patients with coexisting liver disease require preparations that do not need hepatic hydroxylation, whereas patients with congestive heart failure require preparations that minimize salt retention. When asthma and pregnancy coexist, it is vital that symptoms of bronchospasm are controlled to protect the fetus. During stressful situations, such as surgery, it is important to consider the possibility of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression if the asthmatic patient has been previously treated with corticosteroids.\n",

In the majority of persons, not only asthmatics but also healthy individuals, characteristic diurnal variations in PEF are found. The variation amplitude is greatest in asthmatics. The scientific basis for the proposed norms and standards is incomplete but suggests that normal daily variations in PEF are less than 15-20%, calculated as the difference between the highest and lowest daily values as a percentage of the highest. At least 2-4 daily measurements should be made to obtain a reliable picture of the pattern of variation.\n",

On account of its simplicity, the method is suitable for outpatient monitoring of asthmatic patients in general practice and it can provide a valuable objective assessment of pulmonary function to supplement clinical assessment and the patient's symptoms. Employment of PEFM as a predictor of the short-term of long-term prognosis is good on a group basis but unsatisfactory in prediction of the prognosis for the individual patient.

      "ABSTRACT Respiratory infections: their role in airway responsiveness and the pathogenesis of asthma.The effects of RVIs on airway reactivity are multiple but do not necessarily include direct changes in the intrinsic contractile properties of airway smooth muscle. Rather, respiratory viruses influence bronchial smooth muscle function through a variety of other mechanisms: production of virus-specific IgE antibodies, epithelial injury, polymorphonuclear-dependent inflammation, and enhanced mediator release. Thus, a common pathway to airway hyper-reactivity during respiratory viral illnesses is an overall enhancement of factors that cause or lead to inflammation. When the airways become the target of enhanced inflammation, bronchial reactivity and obstruction are accentuated. Although many questions remain to be answered, future studies to evaluate the biology of respiratory virus effects on mechanisms of allergic sensitization and airway responsiveness promise to provide a greater understanding of the pathogenesis of asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Relationship of different serum levels of theophylline on methacholine sensitivity.With an increased awareness of the importance of bronchial hyperreactivity on the clinical state of asthma, efforts at establishing effective treatment for asthma have been aimed at trying to reduce the level of bronchial hyperreactivity. This study investigated whether or not theophylline at different serum concentrations had any effect on bronchial hyperreactivity, as measured by methacholine challenges. Twelve adult subjects with mild asthma participated. All subjects were atopic and were nonsmokers. Subjects were studied on three separate occasions according to a double-blind, randomized, crossover study design with one of the following medications: two placebo capsules in the morning and evening, a placebo and 250 mg of sustained-release theophylline in the morning and evening, or two 250 mg sustained-release theophylline capsules each morning and evening. Subjects were administered their medication between 5 and 15 days before performing methacholine challenges in the morning at the presumed trough level, and in the afternoon at the presumed peak serum theophylline level. Despite statistically significant differences in the pulmonary function and theophylline levels between the two active dosages (p less than 0.05 for both), there was no difference in methacholine sensitivity at the time of ingestion of the two dosage forms. There was also no correlation between a particular theophylline level and degree of methacholine sensitivity. It was concluded that, although theophylline has significant bronchodilator capability, it has little, if any, effect on bronchial hyperreactivity, as measured by methacholine challenges. Thus, other forms of long-term therapy should be used in reducing bronchial hyperreactivity.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Comparative protective effect of the inhaled beta 2-agonist salbutamol (albuterol) on bronchoconstriction provoked by histamine, methacholine, and adenosine 5'-monophosphate in asthma.We have investigated the ability of salbutamol to protect against bronchoconstriction induced by methacholine, histamine, and adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) in nine subjects with asthma. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, salbutamol, 2.5 mg administered by nebulization, increased the geometric mean provocation concentrations of methacholine, histamine, and AMP required to produce a 20% decrease in FEV1 from 0.3 to 2.2, 0.4 to 3.8, and 4.0 to 106.7 mg/ml after placebo and active treatment, respectively (p less than 0.01). Thus, this dose of beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist displaced the concentration-response curves for methacholine, histamine, and AMP to the right in a parallel fashion by 8.8 (0.6 to 29.3)-, 10.3 (1.4 to 33)-, and 26.6 (1.5 to 76.6)-fold, respectively, the difference between the results for AMP and those for histamine and methacholine being statistically significant (p less than 0.01). For six of the nine subjects studied, salbutamol displaced the concentration-response curve for AMP to the right by greater than 50-fold. There was no correlation between bronchodilatation and protection against bronchoconstriction induced by any of the agonists. We conclude that salbutamol protects against bronchoconstriction provoked by methacholine and histamine by functional antagonism, whereas with AMP, an additional activity is demonstrable, possibly involving inhibition of mast cell-mediator release.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Methylprednisolone pulse therapy in acute severe asthma. A randomized, double-blind study.Methylprednisolone pulse therapy (MPPT) has been shown to possess a long-lasting effect in other immune-inflammatory diseases without the well-known side effects caused by long-term treatment with glucocorticosteroids. In an attempt to reduce the long-term use of oral steroids in asthmatics, we conducted this double-blind, double-dummy study to compare the use of MPPT (1 g of methylprednisolone intravenously) (8 patients) with a short course of oral prednisolone (10 patients) in asthmatics presenting with acute severe asthma. Both treatments were effective in relieving the acute attack of asthma. The MPPT-treated patients did not show a faster resolution than did the orally treated group. No patients needed assisted ventilation, and no deaths occurred. One week after the treatment FEV1 tended to decrease in the methylprednisolone group compared with the oral prednisolone group (P = 0.06). The patients initially receiving MPPT needed supplementary prednisolone earlier and in higher doses than did the patients receiving oral prednisolone as initial treatment. At the end of the 12 weeks' study period, the groups reached identical FEV1. In conclusion, we did not find intravenous methylprednisolone superior to oral prednisolone in the treatment of acute attacks of severe asthma, but methylprednisolone pulse therapy had a shorter duration as regards protection against future asthma attacks.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Basophil histamine release in the diagnosis of house dust mite and dander allergy of asthmatic children. Comparison between prick test, RAST, basophil histamine release and bronchial provocation.The aim of the study is to compare the glass fibre-based basophil histamine release test with skin test (Phazet), RAST (Phadebas) and bronchial provocation test in children with allergic asthma. The study comprised 68 selected children with a case history of extrinsic allergic asthma to danders (cat and dog) and house-dust mite. Skin prick test, RAST, and histamine release were performed in all children and the bronchial provocation test was used as a reference of \"true allergic asthma\". A total of 81 allergen bronchial challenges were performed and 44 children experienced 49 positive provocations. In 2.9% (2/68) of the children histamine release could not be performed due to technical difficulties (low histamine release with anti-IgE). Concordances in the range 76-87% were observed with no significant difference between the tests. The highest concordance (87%) was found between histamine release and bronchial provocation test followed by skin prick test vs bronchial provocation (84%) and RAST vs bronchial provocation (80%). The sensitivity and specificity were calculated for each test. All tests showed sensitivities in the range 90-94% and no significant difference between them was observed. The specificity of histamine release, skin prick test, and RAST was 0.78, 0.69, and 0.63, respectively. The specificity of histamine release was better than RAST demonstrated by 95% confidence intervals. In conclusion, it was found that the histamine release test is a convenient diagnostic method and the study indicates a diagnostic value comparable to the common diagnostic methods in clinical allergy.\n",

These methods have not commonly been applied to studies on lung pathophysiology, however. The aim of this commentary will be to introduce and discuss the potential application of genetic methods to research on the pathophysiology of asthma. Recent efforts to identify genes that determine airway hyperresponsiveness in the genetically standardized inbred laboratory mouse will be reviewed. These experiments demonstrate how genetic background influences the expression of airway responsiveness to certain environmental stimuli and illustrate the application of selected genetic resources.

This asthmatic constitution consisted of a predisposition to allergy, airways hyperresponsiveness, and possibly eosinophilia. Other investigators, however, regarded CAO as simply the late stage of chronic bronchitis. The term chronic obstructive lung disease (COLD) was developed to resolve what was largely a semantic difference. In subsequent years, the term chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has come to be used more often than COLD to describe these patients.

      "ABSTRACT [Extrinsic-allergic asthma--principles, diagnosis, therapy, danger of disability].In Germany approximately 5 per cent of the population suffer from asthma. The disease is characterized by nonspecific airway hyperresponsiveness to various stimuli, leading to airways obstruction. In the majority of cases sensitizations to inhaled or food allergens are revealed by skin tests and/or in-vitro tests (RAST) (\"extrinsic\" asthma). Due to an allergen-induced increase of non-specific airway hyperresponsiveness allergencontacts favor asthmatic symptoms after non-specific stimuli, such as cold air or exercise. Therefore diagnostic measures in asthma should include allergic history and standard allergen skin tests in each case. Nonspecific stimuli often play a predominant role among the causes of acute airways obstruction, depending on the degree of nonspecific hyperresponsiveness. Other cases of asthma are characterized by the absence of senzitizations (\"intrinsic\" asthma). Usually, the symptomatology of these cases is more severe than in extrinsic asthma. In most cases of allergic asthma prognosis is favourable, in contrast to chronic obstructive bronchitis and/or emphysema. The therapeutic approach consists of allergen avoidance and hyposensitization, if feasible, and of a combination of bronchodilating and antiinflammatory drugs. A number of work places has to be avoided. Drug treatment should aim at reducing airways hyperresponsiveness and absence of asthmatic symptoms, requiring (inhaled) steroids in most cases. Other therapeutic principles have to be considered, such as allergen avoidance, cessation of cigarette smoking, change of work place, choice of favourable climates during holidays, and hyposensitisation.\n",

In most children, the diagnosis of asthma can be made on the basis of history, physical examination, and simple investigations. Successful management of asthma is contingent upon both patient and parents having a clear understanding of the condition, the goals, and specific details of treatment. The majority of children with asthma can be managed by avoidance of provoking factors, and suppression of symptoms with drug therapy. Drug therapy should follow a logical scheme such that a child with mild, infrequent asthma attacks would receive intermittent bronchodilator therapy, whereas a child with severe chronic asthma would ultimately be treated with maintenance steroids. Response to therapy should be assessed by serial measurement of pulmonary function. Certain features peculiar to infantile asthma demand a modified approach to the management of asthma in this age group.\n",

Autopsy lungs from 16 patients with bronchial asthma, 13 with other COPDs, and 20 controls were submitted to morphometry of the bronchial muscles. In microscopic slides, cross sections of airways were taken from the segmental bronchi to the terminal bronchioles. The perimeter length L of the basement membrane and the area S of muscles were measured, and the anatomic radius R and the muscular thickness D were calculated in a standardized circular state, in which the basement membrane was stretched into a circle without changing L or S. On bilogarithmic coordinates of D and R on which data from the asthmatics were pooled, it was shown that hypertrophy of muscles was the most pronounced in larger bronchi where constriction was most likely to occur. Closer analysis of patients, however, revealed that besides this typical pattern, which we designated Type I asthma, there was a group of patients (Type II) in whom hypertrophy involved the entire range of airways, including the bronchioles, suggesting that the site of asthmatic response varies among patients. In nonasthmatic patients with COPD, only mild hypertrophy of muscles was found in the large airways, despite the presence of obstructive lesions mainly in the small airways.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Mercury--is it a respiratory tract allergen?].Mercury is a well-known allergen in dermato-allergology, often manifesting as delayed type hypersensitivity contact eczema. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions (urticaria, anaphylactic shock) have also been described for this allergen, most frequently seen in patients with the delayed type contact eczema. To our knowledge this allergen has not been implicated in production of respiratory symptoms. We describe a patient who had aggravation of asthma by mercury contained in dental amalgam. When the dental amalgam was removed there was a great improvement in his asthma. This observation suggests that mercury in the form of dental amalgam may also be an allergen of the respiratory tract, which should not be surprising, bearing in mind the work that shows the existence of mercury vapours from dental amalgam.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Acute bronchoconstriction is not a stimulus for sympatho-adrenal activation in asthmatic or healthy subjects.Bronchoconstriction has been found to cause little sympathoadrenal activation in asthmatic patients. It has been questioned whether this is due to blunted sympatho-adrenal reactivity in asthmatics or if bronchoconstriction is a stimulus for sympatho-adrenal activation at all. We therefore compared sympatho-adrenal responses in eight asthmatic patients and 12 healthy subjects by measurements of plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations before, during and after methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction. Significant bronchoconstriction was obtained in eight of the healthy subjects and in all of the asthmatics. Considerably higher concentrations of methacholine were required to evoke bronchoconstriction in the healthy subjects but the relative magnitudes of bronchoconstriction were similar in the two groups: peak expiratory flow (PEF) decreased by approximately 24 and approximately 28% and specific airway conductance (sGaw) decreased by approximately 68 and approximately 70% in asthmatics and controls, respectively). Methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction did not alter plasma catecholamine levels significantly in either group. In addition, plasma concentrations of catecholamines and neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity (NPY-LI) were measured before and during bronchoconstriction induced by histamine or allergen in 8 and 5 asthmatic subjects, respectively. Plasma noradrenaline, adrenaline and NPY-LI remained unchanged up to 30 min after bronchoconstriction induced by histamine or allergen. We, therefore, conclude that bronchoconstriction is not a stimulus for sympatho-adrenal activation and that the lack of an adrenaline response to bronchoconstriction is not likely to be related to NPY release.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The role of increased airway microvascular permeability and plasma exudation in asthma.Airway oedema and inflammation are recognized as cardinal features of asthma, resulting from increase microvascular permeability of the bronchial circulation with the exudation of plasma and inflammatory cells into the airway lumen. Resistance to airflow is increased and the epithelium is disrupted either directly or by cytotoxic proteins derived from migrating inflammatory cells. Such mediators include bradykinin, platelet-activating factor (PAF), leukotrienes and histamine. Antigen-induced and neurogenic inflammation, generated by immunoglobulin E (IgE) and neuropeptides respectively, may also contribute to oedema generation. Assessment of increased bronchial vascular permeability in animals has largely involved measurement of the extravasation of radiolabelled albumin or protein-bound dyes. Non-invasive techniques are less reliable in humans, but measurement of the rate of clearance of inhaled particles labelled with isotope may prove successful. Airway oedema appears to be an important feature of asthma and future research may be aimed at developing drugs that specifically prevent airway microvascular leakage.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Lymphocytes and bronchial hyperresponsiveness.Non-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness can be defined as an increased responsiveness of the respiratory airways to physical, chemical and pharmacological stimuli. It is a characteristic feature of asthma. Knowledge of the mechanisms contributing to bronchial hyperresponsiveness can provide an insight into the pathogenesis of asthma and could lead to an improved therapy. Several abnormalities have been postulated to underlie the hyperresponsiveness, such as a beta-adrenoceptor dysfunction, hyperreactivity of airway smooth muscle, epithelial dysfunction or damage, increased reflex bronchoconstriction, mucus plugging and mucosal oedema. It is possible that more than one of these abnormalities or other, as yet unknown, mechanisms are involved. In contrast to the role of lymphocytes in the regulation of IgE antibody production, the role of these cells in bronchial hyperresponsiveness has received little attention. We review evidence indicating that lymphocytes are involved in the development of non-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness in some animal models and in patients with asthma.\n",

Both daytime and night symptoms over the first week of the attack were significantly reduced by active treatment.

Bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine was measured using a modified Yan technique. Prevalence rates of respiratory symptoms were obtained using the Tasmanian Asthma Foundation Questionnaire. Considerable overlap of reported symptoms of asthma and/or wheezy breathing and bronchitis and/or loose and productive cough was observed suggesting that a clear distinction between such symptoms in childhood may not be possible. Analyses of data showed the prevalence of reactive airways in children to be 21.3% in Burra and 22.0% in Kingston. These values were the same as results obtained from an earlier pilot study in Burra and similar to results from Wagga Wagga (19.6%) and Auckland (20.1%) but higher than from Belmont (15.5%) and Villawood (15.3%). Increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness was associated with the reporting of symptoms of asthma and/or wheezy breathing (odds ratio, 5.04; 95% confidence interval, 2.18-11.74) and bronchitis and/or loose and productive cough (odds ratio, 2.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-5.13), at any time in the child's life.

      "ABSTRACT Methacholine airway responsiveness decreases during exercise in asthmatic subjects.In many asthmatic subjects, bronchoconstriction develops 2 to 5 min after exercise, reaches a maximum at approximately 10 min, and declines over the next 60 min. However, bronchodilation is typically observed during and immediately after exercise. We measured the bronchoconstrictor responses to increasing concentrations of inhaled methacholine at rest and during two levels of exercise in seven asthmatic subjects to determine the protection against bronchoconstriction afforded by exercise. On the first day, an incremental Stage 1 exercise test was performed to determine the work capacity (Wcap) of each subject. On the second, third, and fourth days, methacholine was inhaled at rest or during steady-state exercise at one-third or two-thirds of Wcap. The bronchoconstrictor response to methacholine was significantly reduced during exercise (p less than 0.0001). The concentration of methacholine required to produce a 20% reduction in FEV1 (PC20) increased from 2.80 mg/ml (%SEM, 1.62) at rest to 7.29 mg/ml (%SEM, 1.43) during exercise at one-third Wcap, and to 31.03 mg/ml (%SEM, 1.74) during exercise at two-thirds Wcap (p less than 0.001). This study has demonstrated that there is greater than tenfold protection against bronchoconstriction by methacholine during exercise, and the magnitude of the protection depends on the intensity of exercise performed. The mechanism of this protection is not known, but may have clinical utility.\n",

We have examined the effect of inhaled 15-HETE on the early and late asthmatic responses (EAR and LAR) and the associated change in nonspecific bronchial responsiveness to inhaled allergen in 10 subjects with atopic asthma. On 2 separate days 3 wk apart, subjects inhaled either 70 nmol 15-HETE or the diluent (sodium phosphate buffer) in a randomized and double-blind fashion, followed by a dose of allergen that had previously been shown to produce a 25% fall in baseline FEV1. Analysis of the area under the FEV1 response time course curves (AUC) in the first hour revealed that preinhalation with 15-HETE increased the EAR by 39% from that achieved after the diluent (p less than 0.05). In the seven subjects who were classified as dual responders by developing a LAR previously (greater than 15% fall in baseline FEV1 3 to 8 h after allergen challenge), 15-HETE did not cause any significant change in the magnitude of the LAR when compared with that observed after placebo. The values of the provocation concentration of histamine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (Pc20) at 8 h postchallenge were significantly reduced on both study days when compared with the corresponding preallergen challenge values, whether analyzed for the whole group or for the seven dual responders (p less than 0.05). 15-HETE had no effect on this allergen-acquired airway hyperresponsiveness to histamine when compared with the diluent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "ABSTRACT Variations of airway responsiveness to methacholine and exercise in asthmatic and normal subjects over a 12-month period.This study looked at seasonal fluctuations of airway responsiveness (AR) to methacholine and exercise in ten mild asthmatic and seven normal subjects. Each subject had a monthly methacholine inhalation test. An exercise challenge with measurement of expiratory flows was performed initially in the fall (F), then in winter (W), and in summer (S). Throughout the study, the subjects were asked to record on a diary card twice daily peak flow rates and respiratory symptoms, one week a month. Airway responsiveness to exercise and methacholine remained generally stable throughout the year, although an increase in respiratory symptoms occurred during fall and winter. The overall AR to methacholine was not significantly different during the different seasons (F, W, S and Spring) with the methacholine concentration producing a 20% fall in FEV1, PC20 (mg/ml) values, respectively, of 1.7 +/- 1.2 mg/ml, 1.8 +/- 1.1, 2.1 +/- 1.2, and 2.0 +/- 1.9 for asthmatics and 79.0 +/- 1.2 mg/ml, 66.8 +/- 1.0, 87.3 +/- 1.0, and 73.1 +/- 1.0 for normals. However, short term variations in AR were associated to exposure to antigens and cold weather. Mean daily peak expiratory flows remained generally stable through the seasons. On the three exercise tests, the VO2 max and the mean % fall in FEV1 after maximal exercise showed large variations; these, however, were not significantly different (mean fall: 16.2% (F), 16.6% (W), and 14.7% (S) in asthmatics).

Ten atopic men with asthma participated in a double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled trial. All subjects had documented EAR and LAR to house dust-mite extract. Responsiveness to methacholine was measured the day before and the day after a standardized allergen-challenge test. L-648,051 was inhaled in two doses of 12 mg 20 minutes before and 3 hours after the allergen challenge. The response was obtained from FEV1 and flows from maximal (V40m) and partial (V40p) expiratory flow-volume curves. All subjects had an EAR and LAR during placebo therapy, but only a minority demonstrated an increase in methacholine responsiveness of more than one doubling dose. The ratio of V40m to V40p during methacholine challenge was higher than during both EAR and LAR (p less than 0.05). There was no difference between drug- and placebo-therapy periods in baseline function, EAR, LAR, ratio of V40m to V40p, and the allergen-induced hyperresponsiveness (p greater than 0.1). These results indicate that an effective aerosolized leukotriene antagonist in man does not protect against allergen-induced airflow obstruction, despite the evidence of an inflammatory response to allergen challenge. This suggests that either the potency or duration of activity of L-648,051 is limited or that leukotrienes C4 and D4 do not play a causative role in human allergic asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Thromboxane A2 could be involved in bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine in asthmatic subjects but not in bronchitic subjects].To determine whether the involvement of thromboxane A2 in bronchial hyperresponsiveness is specific to asthma, we examined the effects of a selective thromboxane synthetase inhibitor (OKY-046) and a cyclooxygenase inhibitor (indomethacin) on bronchial responsiveness to methacholine in patients with bronchial asthma and chronic bronchitis. The provocative concentration of methacholine producing a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (PC20-FEV1) was measured before and after oral administration of OKY-046 and indomethacin in eight asthmatic and 10 bronchitic subjects. Baseline FEV1 value was not altered by OKY-046 or indomethacin. The geometric mean value of PC20-FEV1 increased significantly (p less than 0.005) from 1.78 to 4.27 mg/ml after OKY-046 in asthmatic subjects, but not in bronchitic subjects. On the other hand, PC20-FEV1 was not altered by indomethacin in all subjects. It was concluded that the involvement of thromboxane A2 in bronchial hyperresponsiveness may be specific to asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The risk of nitrogen dioxide: what have we learned from epidemiological and clinical studies?Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is an oxidant gas which contaminates ambient air in many urban and industrial locations, and indoor air in homes with combustion appliances. The Environmental Protection Agency presently regulates NO2 in ambient air as a \"criteria\" pollutant. In spite of decades of laboratory, clinical, and epidemiological research, the health effects of NO2 exposure on humans are not well understood. The toxicological evidence suggests that increased susceptibility to infection, functional deficits from effects on airways, and deterioration of the status of persons with chronic respiratory conditions, including asthmatics, are of potential concern. This paper provides a perspective on the present evidence related to human health effects of NO2. It addresses methodological barriers that limit the available data; assesses the adequacy of the data for risk assessment; and proposes a research agenda to obtain needed information on the health effects of NO2.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Comparison of a multi-allergen dipstick IgE assay to skin-prick test and RAST.A multi-allergen dipstick enzyme immunoassay 'Quidel Allergy Screen' (QAS) has recently been developed commercially for measuring IgE antibodies against nine allergens (house dust 1, house dust 2, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, D. farinae, Japanese cedar, ragweed, cat dander, sweet vernal grass, and egg white) at one time. To assess whether this assay is useful in screening allergen-specific IgE antibody, we compared the titres of IgE antibodies against the nine allergens measured by QAS to those in the skin-prick test and by RAST in 93 atopic asthmatics and 22 normal subjects. We found a good overall agreement between the results of the skin-prick test and the results of QAS (sensitivity = 47.1-81.4%, specificity = 84.5-100%, and agreement = 78.9-88.9%). The sensitivities against house dust 1, D. pteronyssinus, and D. farinae ranged from 77.2 to 81.4%. However, the sensitivities against house dust 2, Japanese cedar, ragweed, and cat dander were low (47.1-68.8%). We also found a good overall agreement between the results of RAST and the results of QAS, except for egg white (sensitivity = 46.2-94.4%, specificity = 87.4-100%, and agreement = 77.4-96.5%). The sensitivities against house dust 1 and 2, D. pteronyssinus, D. farinae, and Japanese cedar ranged from 86.0 to 94.4%. The sensitivities against ragweed, cat dander, and sweet vernal grass were low (46.2-52.6%). There were strong correlations between the titres of RAST and the titres of QAS except cat dander and egg white (r = 0.701-0.924 for the seven allergens). Thus, we conclude that QAS is useful in screening IgE antibodies against multiple allergens at one time. However, because the sensitivities against some allergens tested were low, further improvement of some allergen preparations seems to be necessary in the assay.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The relationship between atopy and non-specific bronchial responsiveness.Atopy is often regarded as a risk factor for the development of asthma, particularly childhood asthma and occupational asthma. This could reflect an association with non-specific bronchial responsiveness (NSBR), though atopy could influence asthma independently. We have evaluated the possible relationship between atopy and NSBR (PD20FEV1 to methacholine) in the siblings of 59 probands with atopic asthma. Thirty-four (58%) were atopic (greater than or equal to 1 prick test with weal diameter greater than or equal to that of a 0.1% histamine control) and 28 (47%) showed NSBR. Atopy and NSBR occurred together more frequently than would be expected by chance (P less than 0.05); both variables being observed in 20 subjects, neither in 17, and only one in 22. A significant association was also noted when atopy was defined by a serum total IgE greater than 150 IU (or greater than 50 IU), but when atopy was defined by other commonly used criteria (greater than or equal to 2 prick tests with weal diameter greater than or equal to histamine control; or weal diameter 2 mm or more greater than a saline control), no significant association was demonstrated. Furthermore, linear logistic regression and multiple regression analyses showed that both the presence and the degree of NSBR were influenced much more by the baseline level of FEV1 than by atopic status. At best, atopy accounted for 10% of the variance of the PD20 measurements. We conclude that atopy is associated with NSBR but not strongly; that the relationship may be readily obscured according to the defining criteria used for atopy; and that atopy should not be used as a marker for NSBR.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Pattern of airway response to allergen extract of Phleum pratensis in asthmatic patients during and outside the pollen season.In order to evaluate the pattern of airway response to a specific bronchial provocative test (sBPT) with an extract of Phleum pratensis standardized in biological units (BU), we studied 27 patients with seasonal asthma due to grass pollen by means of allergologic evaluations, methacholine inhalation test and sBPT, outside the pollen season in all patients and, in 10 of them, also during the pollen season. We used a DeVilbiss 646 nebulizer with a dosimeter, giving increasing doses (0.01-2.5 BU) of the allergen solution and we monitored FEV1 to assess early (EAR) and late (LAR) airway responses. Outside the pollen season sBPT elicited an isolated EAR in 16 and a dual asthmatic response (DAR) in 11 patients. We observed no significant difference between EAR and DAR patients as regards the provocative dose causing a 15% fall in FEV1 (PD15FEV1) methacholine, EAR (expressed by PD15FEV1 allergen) or allergologic data. There was a significant relationship between PD15FEV1 allergen and PD15FEV1 methacholine (r = 0.43, p less than 0.05). The reproducibility of sBPT was assessed in 11 patients outside the pollen season. The correlation coefficients between the two tests were: r = 0.91, p less than 0.001 for the total delivered dose of allergen during sBPT; r = 0.79, p less than 0.01 for PD15FEV1 allergen; r = 0.95, p less than 0.001 for the maximum percent fall in FEV1 during LAR. Ten patients repeated all tests during the grass pollen season. PD15FEV1 methacholine and baseline FEV1 decreased significantly during the pollen season, but PD15FEV1 allergen did not change significantly during the season.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "ABSTRACT Management of asthma and chronic airflow limitation. Are methylxanthines obsolete?After almost 50 years as first-line drugs in the management of asthma and COPD, methylxanthines have been largely superceded by inhaled adrenoceptor agonist and anticholinergic bronchodilators which are more potent and far less toxic. Accumulating evidence indicates that intravenous theophylline contributes side effects, but is rarely of benefit in acute exacerbations of asthma or COPD. In the maintenance therapy of asthma, first-line therapy is dose-optimized inhaled steroids, reducing the need for bronchodilators. Inhaled adrenoceptor agonists are second line medications, anticholinergic aerosols third line, and theophylline, if needed at all, may fulfill a minor systemic steroid-sparing function in severe asthmatics on maximum doses of the inhaled medications. In the maintenance therapy of some patients with COPD, theophylline sometimes may be useful but these responders should be identified by objectively establishing therapeutic benefit. Since many patients have side effects from the methylxanthines, while their therapeutic benefit over and above dose-optimized inhaled therapy is marginal, their continued almost routine use in the management of reversible airflow obstruction is hard to justify, although this class of drugs may be useful in selected patients in whom both subjective and objective benefit can be demonstrated. In COPD, theophylline may improve exercise capacity in some patients by still incompletely understood mechanisms probably unrelated to bronchodilation.\n",

In 46 healthy adult volunteers, there were no statistically significant alterations in pulmonary function as measured by spirometry and histamine bronchoprovocation tests in the first week following monovalent CR influenza virus vaccine [type A (H3N2, H1N1) and type B]. Among healthy adults with pre-inoculation PC20s less than 10 mg ml-1, 8/12 were infected following vaccination but no significant alterations occurred in histamine bronchoprovocation. In 11 asthmatic adults, no statistically significant alterations in pulmonary function, as measured by spirometry, were noted during the first 7 days postinoculation with bivalent CR influenza virus vaccine type A (H3N2 and H1N1). Postinoculation respiratory illnesses were more common in CR influenza virus vaccine recipients than placebo recipients, but they were mild, consisting of afebrile pharyngitis and transient rhinorrhea. Attenuated CR influenza virus vaccines do not appear to impair pulmonary function during the first week following immunization of healthy and asthmatic adults.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Effect of nitrogen dioxide on exercise-induced bronchial asthma and the sensitivity of the respiratory tract to methacholine].In patients with bronchial asthma, airway hyperreactivity may be further increased by exposure to low concentrations of nitrogen dioxide. We studied the effect of inhaled nitrogen dioxide in 11 patients with bronchial asthma who presented with normal lung function values. On two different days, 20 min tidal breathing of either filtered air or 0.25 ppm nitrogen dioxide was followed by bicycle exercise (average minute ventilation 30 l/min). One hour after the end of exercise, we performed a methacholine provocation challenge and determined PC100SRaw. The methacholine provocation challenge was repeated on another day (control day). Mean (SEM) SRaw increased by 79.8 (23.8) % and 82.4 (24.9) % after breathing of filtered air and nitrogen dioxide during exercise, respectively (n.s.). Mean (SEM) PC100SRaw was 0.409 (0.205), 0.407 (0.201) and 0.455 (0.181) mg/ml after breathing of filtered air, nitrogen dioxide and on the control day, respectively (n.s.).

On the basis of acute controlled exposure studies, SO2 causes transient airflow obstruction in patients with asthma, but not necessarily in patients with bronchitis or lung fibrosis. The photochemical oxidants (ozone, NO2) induce an increase in airway responsiveness, ozone being of greater potential hazard than NO2. These effects have been described for healthy subjects and asthmatics. Acid aerosols may produce transient bronchoconstriction in asthmatics.

The aims of therapy are tissue oxygenation and cure of the underlying disease which has led to respiratory failure. By adapting ventilator settings to the respiratory mechanics of the individual patient, complication due to barotrauma can be avoided.

Medium correlations were found for the oscillatory parameters and Raw, whereas for tc-PO2 and Raw the correlation was markedly lower. In terms of percentage the greatest change was found in reactance, in relation to the initial value, followed by Raw and FEV1. The interindividual variability resulted in the highest values for the reactance, followed by Raw and FEV1. Interindividual variability showed the highest values for the reactance before oscillatory resistance and Raw. In respect of reactivity, reactance also had the highest values.

      "ABSTRACT Treatment of steroid-induced osteopenia with calcitonin in corticosteroid-dependent asthma. A one-year follow-up study.Sixty-two steroid-dependent asthmatics who had not received any form of treatment to prevent bone loss were studied during a 12-month period. Patients were randomly divided into two groups. Thirty-one patients were treated with 1 g of elemental calcium taken daily plus 100 IU of salmon calcitonin every other day, administered subcutaneously; the remaining 31 patients received only calcium supplementation. In the calcitonin group, 11 patients dropped out of the study because of severe side effects (seven patients), lack of compliance (three patients), and exacerbation of asthma (one patient). The 20 patients who completed the 12-month follow-up period were analyzed and compared with 20 sex-matched patients from the control group. At one year, bone mineral density (BMD) had increased in the calcitonin group by a mean of 4% (p less than or equal to 0.001), whereas in the control group BMD had decreased by 2.5% (p less than or equal to 0.05). Parameters of bone remodeling (alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin) decreased significantly in the calcitonin-treated group but not in the control group. Our findings show that calcitonin 100 IU, given three times/wk, is an effective drug in the treatment of steroid-induced osteopenia. Side effects, however, are frequent and cause a high degree of dropout from therapy. These findings suggest that further studies should be carried out with lower doses of calcitonin or by other better tolerated forms of delivery such as in a nasal spray.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Elevated levels of leukotriene C4 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from atopic asthmatics after endobronchial allergen challenge.Sulfidopeptide leukotrienes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma because of their ability to induce bronchospasm, airways hyperreactivity, and increased mucus production. In the present study, the leukotrienes (LT) C4, D4, and E4 were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) before and 5 min after endobronchial allergen challenge in four subject groups: nonatopic nonasthmatic, nonatopic asthmatic, atopic nonasthmatic, and atopic asthmatic. As determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), after allergen challenge, the predominant sulfidopeptide leukotriene found in BALF from atopic asthmatics was LTC4. Smaller amounts of LTD4 and LTE4 were detectable. The baseline level of leukotrienes in the atopic asthmatics was 64 +/- 18 pg/ml, with measurable levels being found in nine of 11 samples. Atopic nonasthmatics had measurable levels in only one of seven baseline samples, whereas five of six nonatopic subjects had undetectable levels. Allergen challenge in atopic asthmatics resulted in significant increases in LTC4 over prechallenge levels (64 +/- 18 to 616 +/- 193 pg/ml) (p less than 0.01) and over levels in the three control groups after challenge (p = 0.0297). The atopic nonasthmatic group also had detectable leukotriene levels after allergen challenge (88 +/- 32 pg/ml), whereas leukotrienes remained undetectable in five of the six nonatopic samples. For comparison, histamine and the prostanoids prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) and thromboxane B2 (TxB2) were also measured in BALF. The levels of all three of these mediators increased in BALF from atopic asthmatics after allergen challenge. After allergen challenge, the best correlation was found between the levels in BALF for the prostanoids PGD2 and TxB2 (r = 0.88).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "ABSTRACT Twenty-four hour lung function in adult patients with asthma. Chronoptimized theophylline therapy once-daily dosing in the evening versus conventional twice-daily dosing.Many patients with asthma experience a worsening of symptoms at night and in the early morning, resulting in sleep disruption and possibly altered daily performance. A bronchodilator agent that exerts its maximal effect overnight to control nocturnal symptoms, without a worsening of the disease during the daytime, should improve the treatment of asthma. This investigation examined the efficacy and kinetics of a new chronotherapeutically optimized, sustained-release theophylline formulation administered once daily (OD) in the evening at 8:00 P.M. in comparison with a conventional sustained-release theophylline administered twice daily (TD) at 8:00 A.M. and at 8:00 P.M. in the same dose. After a theophylline clearance study to substantiate normal or slow metabolism of the drug, a dose-titration period, and a 24-h baseline spirometric study of patients not receiving any medication, participants were randomized to 7-day treatment phases with either OD or TD. Each outpatient segment of 6 days of OD and TD was followed by a 24-h inpatient study on Day 7 when serum drug level and spirometric (PEF, FEV1, and FEF25-75) parameters were obtained every 2 h. The conventional TD treatment was associated with a constant serum theophylline level over the 24 h. In contrast, the OD treatment was associated with larger peak-to-trough drug level fluctuation, with higher levels produced overnight and lower ones in the evening at the end of the dosing interval. Compared with the baseline references, both OD and TD significantly improved airflow over the entire 24 h and to a comparable extent. However, between 2:00 and 6:00 A.M., PEF and FEV1 were significantly greater with OD than with TD. The improvement in PEF and FEV1 at this time, because of OD, was correlated with the serum theophylline level. This was not the case for TD. The improvement in airflow over baseline values between 2:00 and 6:00 P.M. was not correlated with theophylline level with either treatment regime. Overall, the chronotherapeutically conceptualized OD treatment administered in the evening resulted in better airflow levels overnight than did the TD regime without loss of airflow in the afternoon.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Inflammatory cells and eosinophilic activity in asthmatics investigated by bronchoalveolar lavage. The effects of antiasthmatic treatment with budesonide or terbutaline.We investigated the constituents of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) regarding cell profiles and released eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP) in 11 patients treated occasionally with inhaled bronchodilators (Group A) and 11 patients treated regularly with inhaled corticosteroids (Group B). A normal, healthy control group of 12 subjects was also recruited. Compared with Group A, Group B had a reduced recovery percentage of infused volume (p less than 0.05) and total cell number (p less than 0.01). Compared with the control group, there was a significant increase in the percentage of eosinophils (p less than 0.05) in both groups of asthmatics. In Group A there was also a significant increase in mast cells (p less than 0.05), serum-ECP (p less than 0.05), and BAL-ECP (p less than 0.001). No correlations between any of the cell variables and the level of airway responsiveness measured as PC20 histamine were found in any group. Group A patients were investigated twice--before and after 4 wk of randomly allocated treatment with either a regular beta-2-receptor agonist (terbutaline 250 micrograms, two puffs four times a day) or a regularly inhaled corticosteroid (budesonide 200 micrograms twice a day). The BAL differential cell counts were similar and not significantly affected by either treatment. However, BAL-ECP levels were decreased by budesonide treatment (p less than 0.05). ECP levels in serum and BAL were significantly correlated (p less than 0.05 to 0.001). The eosinophilic cell involvement in asthma is further emphasized by this study but the increase in numbers of eosinophils seems less important than their activity, here measured as release of one degranulation product, ECP. To suppress disease activity, repeated long-term treatment is important, but clear preference for either treatment cannot be given on the basis of our present results.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Observations on heaves. An asthma-like syndrome in the horse. 1964.Observations in six horses with heaves established a clear relationship between attacks of heaves and the feeding of hay. Severe acute attacks were accompanied by striking changes in the eosinophil count and the sedimentation rate. The variation in the severity of heaves in relation to the feeding and withholding of hay is accounted for by assuming that attacks result from a transient, obstructive lesion in the bronchial tree or lung caused by hypersensitivity to some component of hay. The observations strongly suggest that heaves is a respiratory allergic disease in the horse. The relation of heaves to pulmonary emphysema in the horse is discussed.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Correspondence between forced oscillation and body plethysmography during bronchoprovocation with carbachol in children.We compared dose-response curves obtained with the forced oscillation technique (FOT) and with body plethysmography during bronchoprovocation in children. In 40 stable asthmatic children (age, 5-16 yr) we performed challenges with doubling concentrations of inhaled carbachol (0.15-10 mg/mL) until specific airway resistance SRaw had increased by 100% (PC100SRaw). The FOT-response was assessed by total respiratory system resistance (Rrs, cmH2O.1(-1).s) and reactance (Xrs, cmH2O.1(-1).s) from 8 to 26 Hz, expressed as mean Rrs (Rrs), mean Xrs (Xrs), Rrs at 8 Hz (Rrs8), and mean slope of Rrs (dRrs/df). Dose-response curves were analyzed for threshold concentrations (TC) causing a 3 SD change from baseline and sensitivity indices (SI) defined as differences between baseline and postchallenge values (at PC100SRaw) divided by baseline SD. Median TC of Rrs8, Rrs, Xrs, dRrs/df, and SRaw was 0.21, 0.30, 0.34, 0.41, and 0.42 mg/mL, respectively, indicating a slightly higher sensitivity for FOT. Median SI values of SRaw and Xrs (12.0 and 8.2; difference n.s.) were significantly higher than those of the other parameters. Multiple regression analysis revealed only the absolute change of Xrs (delta Xrs), baseline Rrs and age as significantly (P less than 0.001) correlated with the percentage change of SRaw (delta %SRaw). Best correlation (r = 0.86) with delta %SRaw was found for the function: FOT score = -102.5 X delta Xrs X exp(-0.196 X Rrs + 0.038 X age). Provocative concentrations estimated by this FOT score differed from PC100SRaw by less than one (two) concentration steps in 34 (40) out of 40 children.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "ABSTRACT Asthma: a disorder of adrenergic receptors?For the past 20 years, the hypothesis that bronchial asthma represents an imbalance between deficient activity of the beta-adrenergic receptor pathway and/or enhanced activity of alpha-adrenergic/muscarinic cholinergic pathways in the regulation of airway smooth muscle has been a popular idea. Although some evidence supports this hypothesis, direct proof of its validity has been elusive. Concepts regarding the pathobiology of asthma have shifted from a focus on changes in smooth muscle per se to the prominent inflammatory nature of this disorder. We review some of the evolving information regarding the pathogenesis of this disorder and discuss how altered neurohormonal regulation of key inflammatory cells may contribute to the asthmatic condition.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Venous blood platelets decrease during allergen-induced asthmatic reactions.To determine whether circulating platelets alter during asthmatic reactions induced by allergens, we studied nine subjects previously shown to develop an early or dual asthmatic reaction after inhalation challenge with extracts of house dust mite or grass pollen. In each subject, FEV1, circulating platelets and leucocytes were measured before, 15, 30 and 60 min, and 2, 4, 6 and 8 hr after inhalation of allergen and diluent control administered in a single-blind, randomized fashion. The same procedure was repeated in six of the nine subjects after bronchoconstriction induced by methacholine. Each subject developed an early asthmatic reaction after allergen inhalation challenge, which was followed by a late asthmatic reaction in six subjects and by an equivocal late asthmatic reaction in two of them (fall in FEV1 of 15 and 17% respectively). Compared with the control day, circulating platelets significantly decreased during the allergen-induced early asthmatic reaction (P less than 0.025, at 30 min). Platelet counts returned to baseline values within 4 hr and remained steady thereafter both in subjects who did and did not develop a late asthmatic reaction. No changes in platelet counts occurred after bronchoconstriction induced by methacholine. Diurnal increase of leucocyte numbers occurred after challenge with both allergen and diluent control. These results suggest that platelets may be involved in the pathogenesis of allergen-induced asthmatic reactions.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Choline magnesium trisalicylate in patients with aspirin-induced asthma.Treatment of inflammatory diseases of asthmatics can be a serious problem since some patients show intolerance to aspirin and other non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs that are cyclooxygenase inhibitors. Salicylates were believed to be well tolerated, but recent reports have demonstrated that diflunisal and salicylsalicylic acid can precipitate asthma attacks in aspirin-intolerant patients. This study was designed to determine the tolerance of choline magnesium trisalicylate (CMT), a nonacetylated salicylate with potent analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity, in 23 asthmatics with aspirin hypersensitivity confirmed by oral challenge. The study consisted of three phases: 1) patients received increasing doses (50-1,500 mg) of CMT under a single-blind protocol; 2) patients received either a placebo or CMT challenge in a double-blind, randomized, cross-over design; 3) patients received CMT at daily 3,000 mg doses for 1 week. Throughout the study, pulmonary function tests, peak nasal inspiratory flow, and serum salicylate and thromboxane B2 (TXB2) levels were monitored. Results showed no airway obstruction, nasal congestion or rhinorrhea after CMT. There was no significant decrease in serum TXB2 levels, indicating the absence of cyclooxygenase inhibition with CMT. We conclude that choline magnesium trisalicylate is a safe drug for treatment of different anti-inflammatory disorders in asthmatics with aspirin hypersensitivity.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Mechanisms of hyperinflation in asthma.We studied 11 mild asthmatics to verify whether the mechanisms of hyperinflation in asthma could be inhibited or overcome by passively changing lung volumes. On day 1, we induced a fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 30-60% by methacholine inhalation and measured the resulting increase in FRC (delta FRC). The delta FRC was 729 +/- 378 ml (mean +/- SD). On day 2, with the subject supine in an iron lung, we measured oesophageal (Poes), gastric (Pgas) and transdiaphragmatic (Pdi) pressures, and changes in functional residual capacity (FRC) (delta V) induced by extrathoracic pressures from -20 to +20 cmH2O before and after bronchoprovocation. With positive pressures, the FRC decreased and reached a plateau at 10 cmH2O pressure or higher. This plateau was at a mean FRC of 839 ml higher after the bronchoprovocation than before. Pdi at FRC varied in the same direction as the extrathoracic pressure and was not modified by the bronchospasm. Peak inspiratory Pdi, without pressure applied in the iron lung, increased from 13.6 +/- 5.4 to 28.1 +/- 13.5 cmH2O after methacholine; extrathoracic pressure of -20 cmH2O decreased this latter value to 15.4 +/- 7.3 cmH2O (p less than 0.01). The increased lung volume and the displaced chest wall recoil curve after provocation were not inhibited by positive or negative extrathoracic pressures. Our data show that the mechanisms of hyperinflation are not eliminated or overcome by passively changing lung volumes and support the hypothesis that persisting activity of inspiratory muscles other than the diaphragm during expiration and perhaps a prolonged expiratory time constant are responsible for hyperinflation in asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Comparative effects of volume history on bronchoconstriction induced by hyperventilation and methacholine in asthmatic subjects.The aim of this study was to find out if bronchodilatation following deep inspiration can be induced by the inhalation of a \"natural\" stimulus (hyperventilation of cold dry air), and if the effect is similar to that induced by methacholine. After baseline assessment of lung resistance (RL), 10 asthmatic subjects were asked to inhale cold dry air for 3 min. RL was monitored continuously for 3-4 min, at which time subjects were asked to take a fast deep inspiration. After recovery, the manoeuvre was repeated and RL was reassessed. The manoeuvre was then repeated a third time. After functional recovery, progressive doses of methacholine were inhaled until the increase in RL was comparable to that obtained after hyperventilation (56 +/- 16% and 65 +/- 24%, respectively, mean +/- SD, NS). The same deep inspiration manoeuvre was repeated three times with recovery as after hyperventilation of cold dry air. Maximum changes in RL were not significantly different after each of the three manoeuvres for either type of bronchoconstriction. The mean fall in RL was 14.2 +/- 9.9% after hyperventilation and 16.4 +/- 10.5% after methacholine. There was a satisfactory correlation (r = 0.80, p less than 0.01) between the bronchodilatation after deep inspiration for both types of stimuli. We conclude that the bronchodilator effect of deep inspiration is no different using either a pharmacological stimulus (methacholine) or a \"natural\" stimulus (hyperventilation of unconditioned air). These results show that assessing the response to hyperventilation with manoeuvres requiring deep inspiration, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) may alter airway tone in a way similar to pharmacological stimuli.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Inhibition of adenosine 5'-monophosphate- and methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction in asthma by inhaled frusemide.Recent studies have shown that inhaled frusemide exerts a protective effect against various bronchoconstrictor stimuli in asthma including exercise, fog and allergen. Since mast cell activation seems to be a component of bronchoconstriction by these stimuli it is possible that inhibition of mediator release accounts for some or all of the inhibitory effects of frusemide in asthma. Since inhaled adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is another stimulus that produces bronchoconstriction by augmenting mast cell mediator release, we have investigated the ability of this drug to antagonise the airway effects of inhaled AMP and methacholine in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of 12 asthmatic subjects. Inhaled frusemide (approximately 28 mg) administered 5 min prior to challenge increased the provocation concentration of inhaled AMP and methacholine required to reduce forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV) by 20% from baseline from 30 to 96 mg.ml-1 (p less than 0.01) and from 1.1 to 1.8 mg.ml-1 (p less than 0.01), respectively. The protection that frusemide afforded against AMP was significantly greater than that against methacholine (p less than 0.05). These data suggest that inhaled frusemide may serve as a functional antagonist against a smooth muscle spasmogen, such as methacholine, possibly by augmenting prostanoid generation. Its more potent activity against AMP and other bronchoconstrictor stimuli, that are considered to involve mast cell mediators, suggests an additional action on mast cell functions possibly at the level of the Ca++/Mg(++)-ATPase.\n",

Ten stable atopic asthmatic subjects undertook bronchial challenge testing, according to a double-blind protocol. Patients inhaled doubling concentrations of either methacholine (0.13-4.0 mg.ml-1) or chlorbutol (0.16-5.0 mg.ml-1) for 2 min until the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) had fallen by 20% from baseline. If this had not occurred following the administration of the final concentration, then this highest concentration was repeated for 4 min. The nine subjects completing the study had a geometric mean provocation concentration producing a 20% fall from baseline FEV1 (PC20) methacholine of 0.16 mg.ml-1 (range less than 0.125-0.475 mg.ml-1). After inhalation of 2.5 mg.ml-1 chlorbutol one subject experienced a fall in FEV1 greater than 20%. In the remaining eight subjects, inhalation of chlorbutol did not affect airway calibre.

      "ABSTRACT Mucosal inflammation in asthma.Over the past decade, it has become increasingly recognized that airways inflammation is one of the major components of asthma. Until recently, measurements of bronchial responsiveness and mediators of allergic reactions were the only methods of studying pathogenetic mechanisms in asthma. With improved diagnostic procedures such as fiberoptic bronchoscopy, it has become possible to investigate these mechanisms and the resulting inflammatory changes in situ. BAL has highlighted the presence of mast cells and eosinophils and has given proof of their mediator participation in airways inflammation and hyperresponsiveness. Endobronchial biopsies have so far yielded results that are similar to those obtained from postmortem studies, although it appears that there are varying degrees of inflammation in living asthmatics. Even in mild disease, the histopathologic features of bronchial asthma are consistent with chronic inflammation. Indirect evidence obtained from allergen challenge leading to increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness during LAR, and direct evidence of inflammatory cells and their mediators in the airway mucosa and lumen after allergen challenge argue for an active role of cells in bringing about inflammatory changes. At present, however, it is not possible to relate precisely the findings obtained by bronchoscopy to the clinical presentation and progression of asthma. Cell activation with production of potent mediators of inflammation may be more relevant to inflammation than the simple presence of these cells in the airways. Almost all the inflammatory cells present in the bronchial wall and lumen have been implicated in the pathogenesis of mucosal inflammation in asthma, but with our current state of knowledge, none can be singled out as the most important contributor. The mast cell was the first to be investigated in depth, and despite the accumulation of large amounts of data concerning its ultrastructure and function, it remains uncertain to what extent this cell is involved in inflammatory responses. Thus, while its main role appears to be that of initiator of allergen-induced responses, the eosinophil has attracted more attention as a proinflammatory cell rather than as an antiinflammatory cell with a capacity to be selectively recruited from the circulation in response to IgE-dependent signals. The eosinophil secretes potent mediators that cause damage to the bronchial epithelium and lead to bronchoconstriction. The role of other cells is at present not as well defined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\n",

      "ABSTRACT Measurement of peptidoleukotrienes in biological fluids.Samples of human bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and urine were utilized to demonstrate methods for quantitation and validation of leukotrienes (LTs). These methods utilize an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) that uses commercially available reagents, the antibody recognizing LTC4, LTD4, LTE4, and N-acetyl LTE4. BALF containing epithelial lining fluid was collected from atopic asthmatics both before and 5 min after the subjects had been challenged with a local instillation of allergen into the airways. BALF samples collected without allergen challenge had low levels of immunoreactive LTs, whereas samples collected after allergen were markedly elevated. After high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation of LTs, EIA revealed the presence of LTC4. The identity was validated by incubating LTC4 with a bovine gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase with dipeptidase activity that converted added [3H]-LTC4 as well as LTC4 immunoreactivity to LTE4. Urine samples collected from six healthy volunteers, one patient with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and three patients in status asthmaticus were also analyzed for LTs. After HPLC separation of LTs and quantitation by EIA, urine samples from healthy subjects were found to have low but measurable LTE4. In contrast, the urine samples from the patients in status asthmaticus and from the ARDS patient had large elevations of LTE4 levels compared with healthy subjects. When the HPLC fractions containing [3H]LTE4 and LT immunoreactivity in the ARDS sample were treated with acetic anhydride, HPLC analysis indicated that both radiolabel and immunoreactivity now eluted at the retention time of N-acetyl LTE4, the derivatized product of LTE4. The methods described are relatively easy and can be used to measure and validate the existence of peptidoleukotrienes in biological samples.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Methylprednisolone therapy for acute asthma in infants and toddlers: a controlled clinical trial.A controlled double-blind trial was carried out to assess the effect of the early introduction of combined corticosteroid and beta-adrenergic drugs for the treatment of acute asthma in infants and toddlers. Seventy-four emergency room patients (aged 7 to 54 months) who were treated for acute asthma were studied. Treatment included, in addition to salbutamol inhalations, a single dose of intramuscular methylprednisolone (4 mg/kg) or normal saline as placebo. The patients were reevaluated 3 hours after initiation of treatment. At that time, patients were either admitted or discharged based on a clinical decision. Only 8 (20%) of 39 patients treated with steroids were admitted, compared with 15 (43%) of 35 in the placebo group (P less than .05). Sequential analysis of 33 pairs, matched by age and severity of symptoms, revealed statistically significant reduced admission rates in patients treated with steroids. In the younger patients (6 to 24 months), admission rate was significantly lower for those treated with steroids (18%) as compared with those treated without steroids (50%) (P less than .05). In the older group (24 to 54 months), the trend was similar but not statistically significant: 23% vs 31% in the steroid and placebo groups, respectively. These data indicate that corticosteroid treatment combined with an adrenergic agent, given early during an acute asthmatic episode, significantly reduces the hospital admission rate of infants and toddlers.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The interrelationship among bronchial hyperresponsiveness, the diagnosis of asthma, and asthma symptoms.Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) to inhaled histamine has often been cited as the gold standard in asthma diagnosis, but recently this has been questioned. This report assesses the relationship of BHR to asthma symptoms and asthma diagnosis in a large community-based sample of children. A total of 2,053 children 7 to 10 yr of age were randomly sampled from Auckland primary schools and assessed by a questionnaire and histamine inhalation challenge. In all, 14.3% had had asthma diagnosed, 29.6% reported having had one of the four respiratory symptoms in in the previous 12 months, and 15.9% had BHR (PD20 less than or equal to 7.8 mumol histamine). After a cumulative dose of 3.9 mumol histamine, the percent change in FEV1 from postsaline FEV1 was unimodally distributed, with those in whom asthma had been diagnosed dominating the severe end of the spectrum. However, 53% of those with BHR had no asthma diagnosis, and 41% had no current asthma symptoms. On the other hand, 48% of all subjects with diagnosed asthma and 42% of children with diagnosed asthma and current symptoms did not have BHR. Although severity of BHR tended to increase with wheezing frequency, all grades of severity (including no BHR) were found for any given frequency of wheeze. An existing diagnosis of asthma identified symptomatic children more accurately than did BHR, regardless of the criteria used for BHR or for \"symptomatic\" and irrespective of ethnic group. In conclusion, BHR is related to, but not identical to, clinical asthma. Bronchial challenge testing is an important tool of respiratory research, but cannot reliably or precisely separate asthmatics from nonasthmatics in the general community.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Effect of inhaled furosemide on metabisulfite- and methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction and nasal potential difference in asthmatic subjects.To evaluate the hypothesis that furosemide inhibits indirect bronchoconstrictor challenges by altering airway epithelial ion transport, we studied its effects on indirect bronchoconstriction induced by inhaled metabisulfite (MBS) and nasal potential difference (PD) in seven subjects with mild asthma. Its effect on direct bronchoconstriction by the inhaled muscarinic agonist methacholine (MC) was studied in six of these subjects. Each subject inhaled furosemide, 30 mg, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled fashion immediately before challenge with MBS (0.3 to 160 mg/ml in increasing doubling concentrations) and, in another study, MC (0.125 to 32 mg/ml) aerosols from a nebulizer attached to a dosimeter. PC20MBS and PC20MC, the concentration of each agent needed to lower FEV1 by 20%, were calculated by linear interpolation of the log dose-response curves. Furosemide had no effect on resting lung function, but it caused a significant threefold reduction in sensitivity to MBS (PC20MBS: GM +/- GSEM, 15.1 +/- 1.6 mg/ml after placebo and 40.7 +/- 1.7 mg/ml after furosemide; p less than 0.001) with a protective index of 64.8 +/- 10.7%. Furosemide caused no change in sensitivity to MC (PC20 MC:GM +/- GSEM, 2.37 +/- 1.61 mg/ml after placebo and 2.19 +/- 1.751 mg/ml after furosemide; NS). In a third study, furosemide, 30 mg, and placebo were inhaled through the nose in a randomized double-blind fashion immediately prior to inhalation of a PC20 concentration of MBS through the nose. Nasal PD was measured before and after placebo or furosemide, and again after MBS inhalation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "ABSTRACT The American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria for the classification of Churg-Strauss syndrome (allergic granulomatosis and angiitis).Criteria for the classification of Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS) were developed by comparing 20 patients who had this diagnosis with 787 control patients with other forms of vasculitis. For the traditional format classification, 6 criteria were selected: asthma, eosinophilia greater than 10% on differential white blood cell count, mononeuropathy (including multiplex) or polyneuropathy, non-fixed pulmonary infiltrates on roentgenography, paranasal sinus abnormality, and biopsy containing a blood vessel with extravascular eosinophils. The presence of 4 or more of these 6 criteria yielded a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 99.7%. A classification tree was also constructed with 3 selected criteria: asthma, eosinophilia greater than 10% on differential white blood cell count, and history of documented allergy other than asthma or drug sensitivity. If a subject has eosinophilia and a documented history of either asthma or allergy, then that subject is classified as having CSS. For the tree classification, the sensitivity was 95% and the specificity was 99.2%. Advantages of the traditional format compared with the classification tree format, when applied to patients with systemic vasculitis, and their comparison with earlier work on CSS are discussed.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Inflammatory markers in bronchoalveolar lavage and in bronchial biopsy in asthma during remission.Bronchoalveolar lavage and BB were performed in 13 asthmatic and six healthy subjects to characterize cellular markers of inflammation in BAL and BB; to compare cellular profile of BAL with cell infiltration in BB; to examine the relationship between bronchial responsiveness and markers of inflammation in BAL and BB. Eosinophils and mast cells were increased in BAL in asthmatic subjects; eosinophils were positively correlated with neutrophils and mast cells. Epithelial shedding was present in nine asthmatic and five control subjects. Intraepithelial cells and cells in submucosa were increased in asthmatic subjects. Eosinophils and intraepithelial mast cells were higher. Thickened basement membrane was associated with more marked cell infiltration in submucosa. Ciliated cells in BAL relate to intraepithelial cells; cells in BAL broadly reflect cell infiltration of submucosa. In the asthmatic group, the degree of bronchial responsiveness correlated with ciliated cells in BAL and with intra-epithelial cells in BB. Marked airway inflammation is associated with stable asthma; inflammatory changes within bronchial epithelium may be linked to the development of bronchial hyperresponsiveness.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Efficacy of atropine methylnitrate alone and in combination with albuterol in children with asthma.The bronchodilator effect of nebulized AMN, albuterol and their combination was evaluated in 16 steroid-dependent asthmatic children. In phase 1, maximal bronchodilation was determined by dose-response studies on separate days. Maximal bronchodilator dose of each drug was administered either alone or in combination during phase 2. In phase 1, 0.11 +/- 0.01 mg/kg of albuterol and 0.03 mg/kg of AMN produced maximum bronchodilation. In phase 2, the peak response to albuterol occurred within 30 min and to AMN, at 60 min. Maximal FEV1 achieved after AMN was 90 percent of the maximal achieved after albuterol. AMN FEV1 response was better than for placebo for 3 h; that for albuterol was better for 4 h. Combination therapy produced a peak response similar to that of albuterol but was better than albuterol by 6 h. Thus, the maximum bronchodilator effect of AMN is less than that of albuterol in asthmatic children, but the combination may extend the period of bronchodilatation.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Attenuating effect of a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor (OKY-046) on bronchial responsiveness to methacholine is specific to bronchial asthma.To determine whether the involvement of thromboxane A2 in bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) is specific to asthma, we examined the effects of a selective inhibitor of thromboxane synthetase (OKY-046) and a cyclooxygenase inhibitor (indomethacin) on bronchial responsiveness to methacholine in normal subjects and patients with chronic bronchitis, diffuse bronchiectasis, and intrinsic bronchial asthma. The provocative concentration of methacholine producing a 20 percent fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (PC20-FEV1) was measured before and after oral administration of OKY-046 (2,600 mg over four days) and indomethacin (450 mg over three days) in ten normal, ten bronchitic, nine bronchiectatic, and eight asthmatic subjects, respectively. Baseline values of FEV1 and forced vital capacity (FVC) were not altered by OKY-046 or indomethacin. The geometric mean value of PC20-FEV1 increased significantly (p less than 0.005) from 1.78 to 4.27 mg/ml after OKY-046 in asthmatic subjects, but not in normal, bronchitic, or bronchiectatic subjects. On the other hand, PC20-FEV1 increased significantly (p less than 0.005) from 2.19 to 8.13 mg/ml after indomethacin in bronchiectatic subjects, but not in normal, bronchitic, or asthmatic subjects. We conclude that the involvement of thromboxane A2 in BHR may be specific to asthma, and bronchial responsiveness of bronchiectasis may be potentiated by inflammatory release of bronchoconstrictor prostaglandins except for thromboxane A2. Further studies using thromboxane A2 receptor antagonists are needed to confirm the conclusion.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The diagnosis of emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and asthma.Although of some value for understanding etiologic mechanisms, the classic diagnostic categories of asthma and emphysema and especially chronic bronchitis have not served clinicians well for defining prognosis and therapeutic options. Until more useful diagnostic categories are available, the choice of diagnostic tests should be guided more by their clinical usefulness than by their sensitivity and specificity for identifying classic diagnostic categories of obstructive lung disease. A history consistent with asthma is as good evidence of asthma as that provided by most tests, especially if combined with spirometric evidence of complete reversibility of episodes of obstruction. Positive bronchial challenge studies and partial responses to bronchodilators are common in asthma but of limited diagnostic specificity. Tests of allergic function are of limited specificity for asthma, although a low IgE level is rare. Findings of reduced expiratory flows, high TLC, and low DLCO, or radiologic signs of hyperinflation, bullae, and pulmonary vascular deficiency pattern are useful for diagnosing cases of severe emphysema, but they are of limited sensitivity for the detection of mild to moderate disease. Advances in high resolution CT offer promise of earlier diagnosis of emphysema. Making a diagnosis of chronic bronchitis based on defined criteria for chronic sputum production is easy but of limited clinical value. Prospective longitudinal studies and advances in technology promise more clinically useful diagnoses in the future.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Characteristics and correlates of asthma in a university clinic population.To contribute more comprehensive information about the characteristics of asthma, this article analyzed patients served by the University of Alabama at Birmingham Comprehensive Asthma Program. Their physicians rated one fifth of these patients as having \"severe\" asthma with the remainder about equally divided between \"moderate\" and \"mild\". One in two first received a diagnosis of asthma ten or more years previously. Common comorbidities were hypertension, obesity, rhinitis, bronchitis, sinusitis, and arthritis. One half had visited an emergency room or been hospitalized for asthma in the past year. Inhaled bronchodilators and continuous theophylline were the most commonly prescribed medications. Side effects, especially tachycardia and insomnia, were common and almost exclusively associated with theophylline or corticosteroid therapy. Spirometric assessment showed chronic airflow obstruction in those with more severe asthma. Prevalence of respiratory symptoms, intensity of medication regimen, incidence of side effects, and health care utilization increased as asthma severity increased.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Quality of life in elderly patients with chronic nonspecific lung disease seen in family practice.We studied the quality of life of elderly patients with chronic nonspecific lung disease (CNSLD) in family practice. We also investigated the relationship between patients' somatic condition and their quality of life. Seventy patients, aged 40 years or older, with a diagnosis or symptoms of CNSLD completed the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) and the list of daily activities (DAL). Pulmonary function (FEV1, IVC) and respiratory symptoms were assessed. The results indicated that patients were more impaired in their physical and psychosocial functioning than healthy control subjects. Most lung function parameters showed no correlation with the SIP scores. The respiratory symptoms of wheezing and dyspnea were related to patients' quality of life. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were more restricted in their daily functioning than patients with asthma. Since the relationship between patients' somatic condition and their quality of life is weak, we recommend comprehensive care that encompasses psychosocial as well as somatic interventions.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Reactive airway dysfunction syndrome in three police officers following a roadside chemical spill.The reactive airway dysfunction syndrome (RADS) is a recently described syndrome in which bronchial hyperreactivity and asthmatic symptoms develop in previously healthy individuals after a single large exposure to an irritating gas, fume, or vapor. We report a cluster of three Philadelphia police officers who developed RADS after a common exposure to toxic fumes from a roadside truck accident. Results of initial pulmonary function testing were normal in all three, and methacholine challenge was required for diagnosis in two out of the three. This syndrome needs to be recognized by physicians dealing with environmental or industrial medicine as a potential cause of loss of work or inability to perform on the job. Also, there is a potential for multiple individuals to develop this syndrome from a single incident.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Effect of PAF-acether inhalation on nonspecific bronchial reactivity and adrenergic response in normal and asthmatic subjects.Bronchial hyperreactivity, although recognized as a hallmark of asthma, is not totally understood. Mast cell-derived mediators, including histamine, have been shown to cause immediate bronchoconstriction, but until recently, no single mediator has been shown to induce prolonged changes in airway reactivity. Recent reports indicate PAF-acether (PAF) can induce increased nonspecific bronchial reactivity in normal subjects but not in asthmatics. We sought to elucidate the role of PAF in airway hyperreactivity by comparing the effect of inhaled PAF on methacholine and isoproterenol airway responsiveness in six nonasthmatic and six asthmatic subjects. Neither nonspecific airway reactivity nor isoproterenol responsiveness was changed following PAF inhalation in the nonasthmatic subjects in the six days following PAF. Asthmatics had increased airway responsiveness to methacholine at two hours post-PAF, which did not persist. Responsiveness to isoproterenol did not change in the asthmatic subjects. Additional evaluation of the role of PAF in causing changes in airway reactivity is warranted.\n",

All asthmatic patients received prick tests for common allergens. A significantly higher number of heavy parental smokers was found in asthmatic children under 6 years of age with negative prick tests (P = 0.02). A stepwise logistic regression was performed in order to verify interactions between parental smoking and other variables.

      "ABSTRACT [Therapy of hayfever and pollen asthma in children with a new, modified allergen extract].During a period of 3 years a controlled and prospective study was performed, in which 20 children with pollinosis and pollen asthma (grass pollen) were treated either with a new modified allergenic extract (preparation I: Purethal) or with a standard semi-depot extract (preparation II: Depot-HAL) from the same producer. During the pollen season symptoms, side effects, additional medication, and pollen counts were registered. 20 patients were treated perennially: 5 with preparation II and with reduction of the doses during the pollen season (group A: treatment during 3 successive years), 15 without reduction of the doses during te season with preparation I (group B, 8 patients: treatment during 3 successive years; group C, 7 patients: treatment during 2 successive years). Patients in all groups showed more symptoms in May and June. In the groups B and C less symptoms were recorded. Especially, the score of asthma symptoms decreased. However, the need for additional medication was somewhat higher in these groups as compared to group A. The differences were not statistically significant. In 50% of the children no local side reactions were observed after the subcutaneous injections. In the groups B and C the number of late local reactions after 6 to 8 hours was somewhat higher. The patients treated with preparation I did not show an increase of allergen-specific IgG during the pollen season. The relative contribution of allergen-specific IgG1 and IgG4 to total specific IgG was lower in the blood samples of these patients as compared to those of group A. The efficacy and the therapeutic safety of the two preparations are comparable. Preparation I has a number of practical advantages, especially in the treatment of children.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Enhanced reactive oxygen species metabolism of airspace cells and airway inflammation follow antigen challenge in human asthma.Airflow limitation and airway inflammation follow antigen bronchoprovocation in sensitized individuals. Inflammation likely results from the interplay of several previously demonstrated factors, but the participation and persistence of enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism of airspace cells after antigen challenge have received more limited attention. We studied nine subjects with mild asthma by bronchoalveolar lavage before and 48 (one subject) to 72 (eight subjects) hours after antigen bronchoprovocation and compared airspace cell numbers and types, cell function, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid protein, albumin, and immunoglobulins. Mild, but significant, airflow limitation persisted at the time of the second lavage. Eosinophil influx was a notable component of the increased airspace cells in postchallenge lavages. Airspace cells demonstrated significantly enhanced ROS metabolism, and total protein, albumin, and IgM levels were higher in postchallenge lavage specimens. Antigen bronchial challenge produces airspace inflammation, which may develop, in part, as a consequence of enhanced ROS metabolism of airspace cells.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Repeated exposure of asthmatic airways to inhaled adenosine 5'-monophosphate attenuates bronchoconstriction provoked by exercise.Inhaled adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) induces bronchoconstriction in subjects with asthma, probably caused by histamine release from airway mast cells, and repeated AMP bronchial challenge leads to attenuation of the bronchoconstrictor response. Since exercise-induced bronchoconstriction may be mediated by hypertonic mast cell degranulation, we postulated that repeated AMP bronchial challenge should reduce the response to subsequent exercise challenge. Eight atopic subjects with asthma took part in an unblinded, randomized trial. On the control study day, a treadmill exercise test previously demonstrated to induce a greater than 20% fall in FEV1 was performed. On the AMP study day, three AMP dose-response bronchial challenges were performed at 1-hour intervals. Each AMP challenge was continued until either a provocative concentration causing a 20% fall in FEV1 had been achieved (PC20) and the PC20 was calculated, or the maximum concentration of AMP (400 mg/ml) had been administered. After recovery of the FEV1 from AMP challenge, a treadmill exercise test identical to the test on the control study day was performed. On the AMP study day, the geometric mean PC20 was 15.3 (7.9 to 29.5) mg/ml for the first test, and 28.2 (10.7 to 77.4) mg/ml for the third test (not significant). On the control study day, the mean maximum percentage fall in FEV1 after exercise was 28.0% +/- 2.7%, whereas on the AMP study day, it was reduced to 13.0% +/- 4.3% (p less than 0.01). A significant correlation was found between the change in responsiveness to AMP induced by repeated challenge and the attenuation of the subsequent exercise response (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "ABSTRACT The effect of sodium nucleinate on allergic and immunological reactions.Experiments on immunized rabbits and guinea pigs indicated that sodium nucleinate (SN) was capable of weakening or entirely eliminating anaphylactic and skin reactions of delayed type hypersensitivity to repeated administration of staphyloanatoxin, APDT vaccine. The findings on patients with the infectious form of bronchial asthma and chronic rheumatism showed that sodium nucleinate attenuated reactions to the subcutaneous administration of staphylococcal and streptococcal allergens. The treatment of patients suffering from infectious-allergic bronchial asthma and rheumatism with SN resulted in the recovery of deficient T cells, T-suppressors, normalization of immunoglobulin concentrations. In children with acute glomerulonephritis sodium nucleinate normalized decreased T-suppressor cells and increased IgG and circulating immune complexes (CIC), resulting in a pronounced remission of disease. The mechanism of desensitization and elimination of CIC by SN has not been explored, however, the parameters of SN-induced immunomodulation are known rather completely. It is suggested that SN brings about accumulation in the cell of cyclic AMP which diminished membrane permeability, activates monoaminooxidase resulting in the degradation of histamine and other biogenic amines, enhances the synthesis of endogenous corticosteroids with their desensitizing properties. All these effects contribute to the elimination of delayed type hypersensitivity. The role of SN in the inhibition of delayed type hypersensitivity remains obscure.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [A case of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia with hyperinfection of Strongyloides stercoralis complicated with smoldering adult T-cell leukemia].A 43-year-old woman visited a clinic for an attack of bronchial asthma which she had been suffering since her childhood. She was treated with prednisolone which was used for the first time. Two weeks later, she had a fever and her chest X-ray showed diffuse reticulonodular shadows on both middle to lower lung fields. In spite of the use of antibacterial drugs, her symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, malaise and fever increased. It was revealed that she had Stronglyoides sterocoralis in the stool. She was referred to our department for treatment and further examination. Transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) was performed, and cyst of Pneumocystis carinii were histologically detected in the lung specimen. Anti-human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) antibody in the serum was 1:4,096 less than. Typical adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells were also observed in the peripheral blood smear at the rate of 10-15% of leukocytes. The parasite was observed in the sputum too. We diagnosed her as having Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia with hyperinfection of Strongyloides stercoralis complicated with smoldering ATL, and the pneumonia might have been induced by steroid therapy (total doses of 500 mg, for 25 days). After sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST compound) was used for the Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, her symptoms markedly subsided, and the chest X-ray findings turned to normal by 45 days after the treatment. Thiabendazole was initially administered for the Strongyloidiasis and the parasite temporarily disappeared from both sputum and stool. Then pyrvinium pamoate and mebendazole were used, but the parasite could not be completely eradicated in the stool. We did not treat the smoldering ATL because there were no symptoms. We have been looking after her as an outpatient now, and she has neither symptoms nor signs.\n",

We have recently seen an asthmatic patient in whom wheezing and dyspnea increased after injection of betamethasone. The patient was a 26-year-old woman who had had bronchial asthma since 1980. She was treated at another hospital for moderate wheezing and betamethasone injections were given in May 1988. After this treatment her condition deteriorated acutely and she was transferred to our hospital. To confirm the possible relationship between betamethasone (sulfite) and asthmatic attack, provocation challenge tests were conducted. Intradermal skin test revealed an immediate positive reaction to sodium bisulfite at a concentration of 100 mg/L. Challenge test with increasing amounts of sodium bisulfite showed a 52% decrease in FEV1, 50 min after inhalation of 5 mg/ml solution. In addition, another inhalation challenge was conducted by use of an Astograph. Rrs immediately increased during inhalation of 10 mg/ml solution. These results suggested that sulfite contained in betamethasone preparation provoked exaggerated bronchospasm in this patient.\n",

The patient had had episodes of dyspnea since 1976, and had been treated with oral bronchodilators and intermittent corticosteroids. After admission, she was given 100 mg of hydrocortisone sodium succinate intravenously. A few minutes later she developed severe bronchospasm and lost consciousness. An endotracheal tube was inserted and she was mechanically ventilated for 2 hours. The patient recovered after 1 hour. An inhalation challenge test with Sulpyrin was positive. When the provocation challenge test with 100 mg of hydrocortisone sodium succinate (Saxizon) injection was performed, she developed subjective and objective evidence of bronchospasm. Intradermal skin test revealed positive immediate reactions to Saxizon, Solu-cortef, Predonine.

To quantify the components objectively, a special program of the patients' examination has been devised involving: 1) analysis of clinical symptoms, 2) pharmacological testing with selective and nonselective sympathomimetic agents and cholinolytics, 3) registration of the duration of the bronchial sputum evacuation (time of expectoration). Basing on relevant results, three variants of the obstruction are distinguished: bronchospastic, inflammatory-edematous++, obturation. The severity of bronchial obstruction progresses from the first to the third variant. Moreover, the efficacy of bronchospasmolytic drugs diminishes as shown by pharmacological tests: first of selective beta 2-agonists and cholinolytics followed by non-selective sympathomimetic agents which may be attributed to their additional alpha-stimulating action. In view of this the question of clinical significance of alpha-stimulated bronchial constriction is discussed with reference to original and literature data.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Surgery for sinusitis and aspirin triad.An 11-year retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the surgical treatment of sinusitis in aspirin-triad patients. Twenty-five patients were selected for surgery when their sinus disease and asthma progressed despite intense medical treatment. Sixteen patients had radiographic evidence of severe ethmoid disease, and their initial surgical procedures were limited (i.e., bilateral intranasal ethmoidectomies). Of these 16 patients, 6 required subsequent surgery for recurrent sinusitis. Nine of the 25 patients had radiographic evidence of severe antral, as well as ethmoid, disease. Their initial surgical procedures were radical, i.e., bilateral Caldwell-Luc operations with intranasal and transantral sphenoethmoidectomies. None of these 9 patients required further surgical treatment for control. This review indicates that if antral and sphenoid disease are detected in association with ethmoid involvement, a radical surgical approach is the operation of choice.\n",

The results showed significantly more immune- and autoimmune-diseases int he dyslexic group. There were no differences between the groups in the frequency of non-right-handedness. There were no interactions with gender, although there were more non-right-handed boys than girls in the total sample. Mothers of children who were dyslexic experienced significantly more negative life-events during pregnancy, they also experienced the pregnancy as more difficult, and they had more spontaneous abortions.

      "ABSTRACT Nebulized albuterol in acute childhood asthma: comparison of two doses.Thirty-three children and adolescents from 5 to 17 years of age with moderate to severe acute asthma were given nebulized albuterol therapy in either a high (0.30 mg/kg body weight) or standard (0.15 mg/kg) dose administered at three hourly intervals in a randomized double-blind study. The high-dose hourly regimen resulted in significantly greater improvement in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). Furthermore, patients receiving the high dose showed a steady improvement in the FEV1 from the start to the end of the study, whereas FEV1 plateaued after the second dose in the standard-dose group. Although a rise in heart rate and a fall in serum potassium level occurred, neither of these changes nor other side effects were different in the two groups. The high-dose therapy resulted in much higher serum albuterol levels than the standard dose. There was no correlation between the drug levels and side effects or initial and subsequent FEV1. It is concluded that occasional hourly high-dose albuterol therapy should be considered for some pediatric patients with acute asthma of moderate severity, especially those who relapse between doses.\n",

We investigated 103 venous blood samples from children and adolescents with bronchial asthma, medicated with sustained-release theophylline preparations. There was a highly significant correlation of the measured values; with a few exceptions, the individual values scattered only narrowly around the regression line. Based on this close correlation, the investigated enzyme immunochromatography test can be recommended for rapid theophylline serum level determinations in clinical practice.\n",

Numerous studies have shown involvement of inflammatory cells and their mediators in the damage of the bronchi. Inflammation leads to morphological changes in the bronchial wall: damage of the epithelium, increased deposition of collagen beneath the epithelial basement membrane, oedema and infiltration of the mucosa with inflammatory cells, hyperplasia of the mucous glands and hypertrophy of the bronchial smooth muscles. The relationship between inflammation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness is complex and remains unclear. This review article will encompass the current understanding of inflammatory mechanisms in asthma and their association with morphological changes in the airways and the syndrome of bronchial hyperresponsiveness.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Evidence of the harmful effects of eosinophils in bronchial asthma].Fifteen asthmatic patients were prospectively selected. If they had more than 450 eosinophils in peripheral blood on admission to hospital treatment and if before BAL had been performed they were not treated by corticosteroids. No associated disease was found which could cause the increased number of eosinophils in peripheral blood except bronchial asthma. BAL was performed when the subjects tested had no dyspnea, usually 1-3 days after the hospital admission. In contrast to blood eosinophilia, increase of eosinophils number in BAL was found to correlate to impairment of clinically measured parameters such as: ventilation level of blood gases and duration of hospitalisation. On the contrary there was no correlation between the level of blood eosinophilia and gas disturbance and duration of hospitalisation. Eosinophilic proteins (MBP, ECP, EPX, EPO) are not the only that harmfully effect the lung cells in the asthmatic attack but the fact that their level in lavage fluid correlates to eosinophilia degree in BAL is evident so the correlation between the number of eosinophils in BAL and impairment of clinically measured parameters is clear.\n",

Pathoanatomical changes in bronchial arteries were more frequently found in patients with COB and BA than in patients with other bronchopulmonary diseases, i.e. that bronchial circulation in patients with COB and BA is impaired. Due to these findings a theory of vasculary-metabolic explanation of pathogenesis of bronchial hyperresponsiveness is based on hypoperfusion and hypoxia of cellular structures in the bronchial wall. Hypoxia is supposed to be an endogenous change in the bronchial wall which causes bronchial hyperresponsiveness in various exogenous stimulants.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Normal reactivity and hyperreactivity in the bronchi induced by respiratory irritants].The influence of age, sex, atopy, baseline spirometry and smoking habit on the presentation of airway reactivity (AR), and the prevalence of hyperreactive subjects was assessed in 176 normals and 143 subjects occupationally exposed to respiratory irritants. The study protocol comprised: a respiratory disease questionnaire, physical examination, skin prick-test to 13 common inhalant allergens, IgE level, spirometry. The nonspecific bronchoprovocation test (NBPT) was performed by the cumulative method proposed by Chai et al. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 1975; 56: 323-327). The results are expressed as PC20FEV1, PC25FEF50, PC25FEF25 and PC25FEF25/75. Age, sex, atopy, baseline spirometric values and smoking are not significantly correlated with indeces of AR. There are no hyperreactors among healthy subjects--according to the criterion: PC20FEV1 less than or equal to 2.17 micromoles of histamine. When the response was measured by flow-volume parameters, there were between 5.1% and 9% hyperreactors. In both examined groups AR has proved to be a highly variable feature. Among workers exposed to irritants there were 5.6% hyperreactors according to PC20FEV1 and between 11.1% and 13.9% when flow-volume parameters were applied. A significant correlation between AR and smoking habit of subjects occupationally exposed to irritants was not found. The level of AR when monitored by flow-volume parameters of subjects continuously exposed to irritants was found to be significantly lower than in normals. The chosen criterion separates successfully airway normo- from hyperreactives. It is a useful diagnostic method in occupational medicine.\n",

An average Rrs increase was 153% when compared to the initial values and it correlated with SaO2 decrease (5.5% of the initial values). In 45 patients along with continual Rrs and SaO2 measurements, bronchoprovocation test and spirogram flow-volume curve were periodically done. Ten of these patients had no significant Rrs or FEV1 changes, but there was a considerable drop in FEF50, FEF25 and SaO2. These results, associated with dyspnea and physical pulmonary findings in the course of BPT, as well as history of patients with similar difficulties in every-day life and in work environment, point to the need of expanding diagnostic criteria for positive BPT and for patients who did not have Rrs increased double the initial values nor sufficient FEV1 20% drop. Spirometry and oximetry as complementary methods, increase Astograph sensitivity to methacholine test. Oximetry has an advantage of enabling continual SaO2 monitoring and increased patient's safety during the BPT.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Forced expiratory flow and oscillometric impedance measurement in evaluating airway obstruction.The application of forced oscillations has been introduced as a noninvasive method to measure the impedance of the respiratory system. Impedance can be partitioned into a real part or resistance and an imaginary part or reactance. The reactance depends on the elastic and inertial properties of the respiratory system. In the present study, resistance and reactance obtained in a frequency spectrum between 4 and 52 Hz were compared with maximal forced expiratory spirometry in 100 out-patients, aged 18-70 years. Resonant frequency and frequency dependence of resistance correlated significantly with selected parameters of the forced expiratory flow volume curve: correlation coefficient values ranged from 0.492 between frequency dependence and FVC and 0.668 between resonant frequency and FEV1. No correlation between average resistance and spirometric parameters reached a statistically significant level. No marked difference was observed between spirometric parameters depending on the early or effort-dependent portion and those parameters depending on the late or effort independent portion of the maximum forced expiration. It can be concluded that each measurement procedure reveals different but characteristic information about the mechanical behaviour and properties of the respiratory system.\n",

After complete avoidance of any further exposure respiratory symptoms persisted or airway obstruction could still be documented in one third of patients. An unfavourable prognosis is significantly associated with the following factors: (1) bronchial obstruction (FEVl/VC) at first pulmonary function test; (2) RAST positive for isocyanates; (3) long latency period between onset of symptoms and end of exposure. Therefore, individuals with isocyanate-induced airway diseases must be immediately removed from any further exposure to these substances.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Use of a management plan for treating asthma in an emergency department.A standardised management protocol has been developed for the assessment and treatment of adults with acute asthma attending an emergency department. The management protocol consists of an assessment sheet for recording essential features of the history and examination findings and a flow diagram with guidelines for initial management that were based on spirometric recordings. The protocol was introduced at Wellington Hospital in 1986. The effect of this intervention was assessed by analysing emergency department records during the three months before and one year after the introduction of the protocol. The use of the assessment sheet improved history taking and led to the increased use of serial measures of airflow obstruction and improved documentation of follow up arrangements. The provision of management guidelines influenced the emphasis of management, including an increased use of corticosteroids intravenously and more frequent use of an additional dose of nebulised bronchodilator. In the light of the initial experience the protocol has been modified and its use either in an emergency department or in general practice is recommended.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Reactive dye induced occupational asthma without nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivity.Current asthma is often excluded by the presence of normal bronchial hyperresponsiveness. We report two asthmatic patients with normal bronchial hyperresponsiveness and one asthmatic patient with mild bronchial hyperresponsiveness (methacholine PC20; 24 mg/ml) which was presumed to be caused by sensitization and exposure to Black GR, the most frequent sensitizer among reactive dyes. They all complained of lower respiratory symptoms after work as well as at the workstation. The bronchoprovocation test with Black GR revealed isolated immediate bronchoconstrictions in all 3 patients and all had high specific IgE antibodies to Black GR-human serum albumin conjugate. After one worker continued at work for 3 days, he experienced a marked drop of methacholine PC20, and it returned to the pre-exposure level during 1 week. The other patient whose initial methacholine challenge was negative developed bronchial hyperresponsiveness on the first day after the dye bronchoprovocation, and returned to normal bronchial hyperresponsiveness on the third day.

Before and after immunotherapy we performed tests in vivo (skin tests with wheat flour and methacholine tests), and in vitro (total IgE and specific IgE to wheat flour). We found substantial prevalence of wheat flour allergy (25.17% of workers), and a significant decrease (P less than .001) in hyperresponsiveness to methacholine, skin sensitivity (P = .002), and specific IgE (P less than .005) to wheat flour after 20 months of immunotherapy. There was also significant subjective improvement (P less than .001). The placebo group showed no changes in these variables.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Effect of exercise on complement activity.Complement measurements of C1, C1q, C2, C3, C4, C5; the anaphylatoxins, C3a, C4a, and C5a; and total hemolytic activity of the classical and alternative pathways were made in 26 experienced adult runners before and after shortterm aerobic exercise. The baseline results were compared with those of nonexercising age-matched controls. In most subjects tested, running resulted in nanogram increases in C3a and C4a with corresponding decreases in the hemolytic activity of C4 (C4H). Baseline values of C3 and C4H were decreased significantly in runners when compared with nonexercising controls. Preliminary studies measuring the effect of exercise on C3a levels were also done in three asthmatic runners. Mean resting and postexercise levels, and exercise-induced increases in C3a anaphylatoxin in the asthmatic subjects were significantly higher than in the nonasthmatic subjects. The findings indicate that short-term exercise results in the activation of C3 and C4 and subsequent generation of C3a and C4a anaphylatoxins, and suggest that both activation of the classical pathway of complement and a selective downregulation of C3 production may occur in persons regularly engaged in aerobic exercise. The exaggerated generation of C3a by asthmatic subjects during exercise raises the possibility that anaphylatoxins play an etiologic role in exercise-induced asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Endogenous opioids modulate the increase in ventilatory output and dyspnea during severe acute bronchoconstriction.The aim of this study was to evaluate whether endogenous opioids are involved in the regulation of breathing pattern and respiratory drive during bronchoconstriction induced by methacholine (MCh). We studied six male asymptomatic asthmatics 18 to 35 yr of age. In a preliminary study we determined the concentration of MCh causing a 60% fall in FEV1 (PC60 FEV1). On two subsequent days, we measured breathing pattern, dyspnea sensation (Borg scale), mouth occlusion pressure (P0.1), and FEV1 before and 10 min after an intravenous injection of either naloxone (0.1 mg/kg) or saline according to a randomized double-blind crossover design. A MCh concentration equal to the PC60 FEV1 was then inhaled, and measurements were repeated 5 min later. Neither placebo nor naloxone affected baseline breathing pattern, P0.1, and FEV1. Naloxone pretreatment did not influence airway response to MCh; the mean percent fall in FEV1 was 65.9 +/- 1.3 and 64.7 +/- 1.2% (mean +/- 1 SE) on the placebo day and the naloxone day, respectively. After MCh inhalation no significant changes in VE, VT, and breathing frequency occurred when patients received placebo. However, P0.1 increased from 1.48 +/- 0.17 to 3.43 +/- 0.70 cm H2O (p less than 0.05), and VT/TI fell from 0.66 +/- 0.08 to 0.52 +/- 0.04 L/s (p less than 0.05). Naloxone pretreatment resulted in an increase in breathing frequency (from 18.2 +/- 1.7 to 22.8 +/- 2.6 breaths/min; p less than 0.05) and VT/TI (from 0.58 +/- 0.06 to 0.74 +/- 0.05 L/s; p less than 0.05) after MCh.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "ABSTRACT The effect of repetitive exercise on airway temperatures.To determine if a relationship exists between intra-airway thermal events and the reduction in pulmonary mechanics that occur in asthmatics when they perform repetitive exercise, we recorded intrathoracic airstream temperatures in seven subjects during and after two identical bouts of cycle ergometry performed 30 min apart. From these data, global and regional thermal energy exchanges were calculated. Inspired air conditions, work loads, and minute ventilations were held constant for both trials. Pulmonary mechanics were measured prior to and serially after each challenge. As expected, the second provocation produced a smaller response than did the first. In association with these mechanical changes, the second challenge also produced less airway cooling and slower rewarming in the central airways. Hence, repetitive exercise trials performed over short intervals attenuate the essential thermal gradients necessary to produce obstruction. To the extent that these differences in intra-airway temperature reflect changes in perfusion, our data raise the possibility that the responsivity of the bronchial microcirculation of asthmatics may be altered by repetitive exercise.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Effect of long-term treatment with an inhaled corticosteroid (budesonide) on airway hyperresponsiveness and clinical asthma in nonsteroid-dependent asthmatics.Several short-term studies have shown that inhaled steroids can reduce airway hyper-responsiveness in asthma. To evaluate whether prolonged treatment can bring about full recovery, this double-blind, randomized, controlled trial examined the effect of budesonide, 400 micrograms daily for 1 yr, on airway hyperresponsiveness. The time course and characteristics of improvements and associated changes in clinical asthma severity were also evaluated. Thirty-two stable adult asthmatics, requiring bronchodilators alone, were selected. Before and monthly throughout the study, airway responsiveness to methacholine was measured and clinical asthma severity assessed by questionnaire, daily bronchodilator use, and number of asthma exacerbations. Patients receiving budesonide showed a fourfold mean improvement in airway responsiveness compared with those receiving placebo (p less than 0.0005), whose responsiveness remained very stable. Fifteen of the 16 budesonide subjects improved and 5 returned to the normal range. Largest improvements occurred during the first 3 months but, in some, were still progressing slowly at 1 yr. Improvements in responsiveness were accompanied by significant improvements in asthma symptoms, bronchodilator use, and number of asthma exacerbations. The results show that regular, prolonged use of inhaled steroid can produce marked improvements in airway hyperresponsiveness, sometimes with full resolution, and these improvements are accompanied by clinically significant improvements in clinical asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Quantitation of mast cells and eosinophils in the bronchial mucosa of symptomatic atopic asthmatics and healthy control subjects using immunohistochemistry.We have used fiberoptic bronchoscopy to obtain endobronchial biopsies in which mast cells and eosinophils were enumerated using monoclonal antibodies directed against mast cell tryptase (AA1) and the eosinophil cationic protein (EG2). Eleven symptomatic atopic asthmatics treated with beta 2-agonists alone and six normal subjects were studied. Over a period of 2 wk prior to bronchoscopy, patients recorded asthma symptom scores, bronchodilator usage, and twice-daily peak expiratory flow. Five days before bronchoscopy, methacholine responsiveness was assessed. Two biopsies were taken from the subcarinae, one of which was processed into araldite for immunostaining by the streptavidin biotin immunoperoxidase method and the other into Spurr resin for electron microscopy. The number of AA1 staining mast cells present in the bronchial mucosa was not significantly different in the epithelium or submucosa between the asthmatic and the normal subjects. However, in the biopsies from asthmatics, there were significantly greater numbers of EG2-staining eosinophils in the epithelium (median, 1.2/mm versus zero; p less than 0.005) and in the submucosa (median, 50/mm2 versus 1/mm2; p less than 0.001). Electron microscopy showed morphologic features of mast cell and eosinophil degranulation in the asthmatics. No correlation could be established between mast cell or eosinophil numbers and indices of disease activity of PC20 methacholine, which points to the complexity of mechanisms responsible for the symptoms and the airway hyperresponsiveness of asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Antigen-induced biphasic eosinophil infiltration in the airways of actively sensitized guinea pigs and its inhibition by PAF antagonist and cyclosporin A].Bronchial eosinophilia is a characteristic of asthma. To elucidate the mechanisms of eosinophil accumulation in the airways, the time course of eosinophil infiltration in the airway mucosa after antigen inhalation was examined in actively sensitized and passively sensitized guinea pig models of asthma. The lungs and tracheae were removed at intervals after antigen challenge, fixed and stained. The eosinophil infiltration was quantitated in the tracheal walls by counting the number of cells per square millimeter. Guinea pigs sensitized by intraperitoneal injection of ovalbumin (OA) responded to a single exposure to aerosolized OA with biphasic infiltration of eosinophils in the tracheal walls; a striking early-phase which peaked at 6 hr and a delayed-phase which peaked at 24 hr and persisted for as long as 5 days. These kinetics were different from those observed with passively sensitized animals which showed only early-phase infiltration. Administration of CV-6209, a specific PAF antagonist, before and 12 hrs after antigen challenge significantly (p less than 0.01) inhibited the early-phase but not the delayed-phase eosinophil infiltration in actively sensitized animals. In contrast, when guinea pigs were treated with Cyclosporin A, a T lymphocyte-selective immunosuppressive agent, throughout the immunization period, the delayed-phase but not the early-phase infiltration was significantly (p less than 0.01) inhibited. These results suggest that PAF may contribute to early-phase and T cell factor(s) may contribute to delayed-phase eosinophil infiltration of the airways.\n",

While therapies are available to the prehospital care provider for treating acute asthma, no previous controlled studies have been performed demonstrating the treatment in the field is efficacious and safe. The authors conducted a controlled trial of the prehospital use of nebulized isoetharine in an urban emergency medical services system. Fifty-two patients with acute asthma were studied. Patients were initially evaluated with a peak flow meter. Half of the patients received isoetharine, while the control group received basic life support only. There was no difference in baseline values. Peak expiratory flow increased from 138 L/min to 148 L/min in the control group, while it increased from 149 L/min to 218 L/min in the treatment group (P less than .001).

      "ABSTRACT Myofibroblasts and subepithelial fibrosis in bronchial asthma.A thickened bronchial epithelial basement membrane has long been regarded as a histopathologic characteristic of bronchial asthma. As we had previously demonstrated that this phenomenon is due to the deposition of interstitial collagens and fibronectin, we have now sought to determine the nature of the cell responsible for this process by studying endobronchial biopsies from eight normal and seven asthmatic volunteers by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. Biopsies were stained with PR 2D3, a monoclonal antibody to myofibroblasts of the pericrypt sheath of the colon and a monoclonal antibody to alpha-smooth muscle actin. The thickness of the subepithelial collagen and the organelle content of the cells therein were determined by electron microscopy. The subepithelial collagen thickness in the normal subjects ranged from 2.16 to 6.26 microns, while that in the asthmatic subjects ranged from 3.75 to 11.1 microns (Mann-Whitney test; P = 0.05). Elongated cells in the collagen layer were identified by staining with PR 2D3. As this antibody also stains smooth muscle, consecutive frozen sections were stained for alpha-smooth muscle actin and the number of positive cells per millimeter of basement membrane was subtracted from the count for PR 2D3. This yielded a count of 4.9 to 9.4 cells/mm in the normal subjects and 11.9 to 20.6 cells/mm in the asthmatics (P = 0.001). There was a highly significant correlation between the depth of subepithelial collagen and the number of PR 2D3-positive, alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive cells (Spearman rank correlation; r = 0.764 and P = 0.006).

After the development of a data base of pharmacokinetic parameters, we examined glucocorticoid pharmacokinetics in 54 patients between 2 and 70 years of age using 70 pharmacokinetic studies after administration of intravenous methylprednisolone (n = 25), oral methylprednisolone (n = 15), intravenous prednisolone (n = 18), and oral prednisone (n = 12). Eleven patients had unusually rapid methylprednisolone elimination (clearance, 565 to 837 ml/min/1.73 m2; population mean, [+/- SD] 380 +/- 100 ml/min/1.73 m2) without an identifiable cause. Incomplete absorption of methylprednisolone and prednisone was observed in three patients and one patient, respectively. Evaluation of glucocorticoid pharmacokinetics in children aged 1 year 8 months to 18 years demonstrated a significant inverse correlation (r = 0.88; p less than 0.001) between prednisolone clearance and age. It is therefore important to consider age in the interpretation of pharmacokinetic data. To simplify measurement of prednisolone clearance, a single-dose single-point method was developed. This was based on a highly significant relationship between the 6-hour postdose prednisolone concentration and prednisolone clearance (log prednisolone clearance = 2.66 + [6-hour postdose concentration] [-0.00167]; r2 = 0.96; p less than 0.0001). Evaluation of glucocorticoid pharmacokinetics in the clinical setting can be used to identify abnormalities in absorption, elimination, and patient compliance. This technique can be used to individualize glucocorticoid dosing regimens.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Sulfur dioxide-induced bronchial constriction in asthmatics and its prophylaxis by salbutamol].Patients with bronchial asthma often develop acute attack in kitchen while burning honeycomb briquet which is widely used for cooking in southern China. Burning of a honeycomb briquet produces 0.6-4.3 ppm sulphur dioxide (SO2) in the kitchen air. To assess whether the above concentration of SO2 can induce bronchial constriction, we performed SO2 bronchial provocation test on 21 asthmatics (male 11, female 10, average age 28.8 +/- 2.0 years), 10 patients with allergic rhinitis (male 3, female 7.28 +/- 1.6 years) and 20 healthy non-smokers (male 13, female 7, 28.1 +/- 1.5 years). FEV1 showed no significant change in both healthy and rhinitis group even a maximal amount of SO2 (10 ppm) was given. The calculated PC20 FEV1 and PC35 SGaW in asthmatics were 3.7 +/- 0.22 ppm and 2.5 +/- 0.18 ppm respectively, which fell into the SO2 range yielded by a burning honeycomb briquet. Orally administered slow release salbutamol created protective effect in 5 out of 8 patients. Salbutamol inhalation, however, completely blocked SO2 induced bronchial constriction. We suggest that patient with bronchial asthma should receive salbutamol aerosol inhalation before cooking with burning honeycomb briquet.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Ketotifen. A review of its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, and therapeutic use in asthma and allergic disorders.Ketotifen is an orally active prophylactic agent for the management of bronchial asthma and allergic disorders. Accumulated evidence indicates that after 6 to 12 weeks of administration, ketotifen significantly reduces respiratory symptoms and the need for concomitant antiasthmatic drugs in about 70% and 50%, respectively, of patients with mild to moderate bronchial asthma. However, absolute improvement in lung function is generally slight. Ketotifen also has pronounced antihistaminic and antianaphylactic properties which result in moderate to marked symptom improvement in the majority of patients with atopic dermatitis, seasonal or perennial rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, chronic or acute urticaria or food allergy. Comparative trials with established agents--notably sodium cromoglycate (cromolyn sodium) in asthma and histamine H1-antagonists in allergic disorders--indicate that ketotifen has comparable clinical utility. Unlike inhaled sodium cromoglycate, ketotifen ameliorates the symptoms of asthma, rhinitis and dermatitis when present together in atopic patients. Patient acceptance of ketotifen is good, although sedation can be troublesome in older children and adults for the initial 2 weeks of treatment. Weight gain is another notable effect in a small percentage of patients. Thus, ketotifen appears to be a useful agent for the management of allergic disorders and bronchial asthma, particularly in patients for whom oral therapy is preferred. Although a lengthy run-in period is needed in the treatment of asthma, in those patients who respond, continued reduction in the frequency and severity of symptoms and in the use of additional antiasthmatic drugs can be anticipated.\n",

Theophylline produced an improvement in symptoms of cough, wheeze, sleep disturbance and PEFR in the 73 completing patients compared to run-in and placebo treatment. Theophylline also produced an improvement in the forced expiratory volume in 1 s and forced vital capacity relative to baseline, and in the difference between actual and predicted PEFR values. Nausea was the most frequent side-effect but both patients' and investigator's global impressions of the effect of study medication were in favour of theophylline.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Twin concordance for a binary trait: III. A bivariate analysis of hay fever and asthma.Self-reported histories of hay fever and asthma were obtained from 3,808 pairs of adult twins 18 years and over registered with the Australian National Health Medical Research Council Twin Registry (1232 MZF, 567 MZM, 751 DZF, 352 DZM, 906 DZO). The prevalence of hay fever and asthma was 0.32 and 0.13, respectively, with little variation with zygosity, sex, and age. The associations between twin pairs for these two traits were analysed, under the assumption of constant prevalences, as a special case of a log-linear model for binary traits in pedigrees using the statistical package GLIM. The model assumption that there are no second- or higher-order interactions was tested in the 2 X 2 X 2 X 2 table of twin by disease outcomes without revealing strong evidence of departure, even in this large data set. The log-linear modelling showed that only three first-order interactions, namely 1) between hay fever in a twin pair, 2) asthma in a twin pair, and 3) hay fever and asthma in the same twin, were necessary to describe the data. The first two interaction terms were significantly larger in identical pairs; the third was independent of zygosity. Under this parsimonious model, there was a significant difference between identical and fraternal pairs in marginal correlation, both in asthma and hay fever, and in the cross-correlation between hay fever in one twin and asthma in the other. This suggests that genetic factors are implicated in both hay fever and asthma and that some of these genetic factors are common (at least among a subgroup of individuals) to both traits.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Effect of sleep and sleep deprivation on ventilatory response to bronchoconstriction.To characterize ventilatory responses to bronchoconstriction during sleep and to assess the effect of prior sleep deprivation on ventilatory and arousal responses to bronchoconstriction, bronchoconstriction was induced in eight asthmatic subjects while they were awake, during normal sleep, and during sleep after a 36-h period of sleep deprivation. Each subject was bronchoconstricted with increasing concentrations of aerosolized methacholine while ventilatory patterns and lower airway resistance (Rla) were continually monitored. The asthmatic patients maintained their minute ventilation as Rla increased under all conditions, demonstrating a stable tidal volume with a mild increase in respiratory frequency. Inspiratory drive, as measured by occlusion pressure (P0.1), increased progressively and significantly as Rla increased under all conditions (slopes of P0.1 vs. Rla = 0.249, 0.112, and 0.154 for awake, normal sleep, and sleep after sleep deprivation, respectively, P less than 0.0006). Chemostimuli did not appear to contribute significantly to the observed increases in P0.1. Prior sleep deprivation had no effect on ventilatory and P0.1 responses to bronchoconstriction but did significantly raise the arousal threshold to induced bronchoconstriction. We conclude that ventilatory responses to bronchoconstriction, unlike extrinsic loading, are not imparied by the presence of sleep, nor are they chemically mediated. However, prior sleep deprivation does increase the subsequent arousal threshold.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Prevalence of occupational asthma and immunologic sensitization to guar gum among employees at a carpet-manufacturing plant.Guar gum is a high-molecular-weight agent that can cause occupational rhinitis and asthma. We surveyed the employees at a carpet-manufacturing plant in which guar gum is used to adhere the dye to the fiber; 162/177 of the employees (92%) participated in the first part of the survey that included a questionnaire and skin prick tests with common allergens and guar gum (1 mg/ml). IgE and IgG antibodies to guar gum were also measured in those subjects (133/162 or 82%) who agreed to blood tests. Thirty-seven subjects (23%) had a history suggestive of occupational asthma and 59 (36%), of occupational rhinitis. Eight subjects (5%) demonstrated immediate skin reactivity to guar gum. Eleven subjects (8.3%) had serum IgE antibodies to guar gum. All subjects, except one subject who had a history suggestive of occupational asthma (n = 37) or positive skin tests (n = 4), participated in the second part of the study. A methacholine-inhalation test was performed during a workshift or in the 3 to 4 hours after the workshift. Five subjects had a concentration of methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 of less than 16 mg/ml (significant bronchial hyperresponsiveness) and positive skin reactions to guar gum. Four of these subjects underwent specific inhalation challenges. The remaining subject had a history of severe bronchospastic reaction on exposure to guar gum, and his FEV1 of 1.6 L made specific challenges impossible. Two subjects had typical isolated immediate reactions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "ABSTRACT Tryptase, a mediator of human mast cells.Tryptase, a mediator secreted by human mast cells during immediate reactions, has demonstrated effects on several pathways in vitro. This enzyme can rapidly inactivate fibrinogen and, as a complex with heparin, may prevent coagulation that may otherwise occur when plasma enters tissues at sites of immediate reactions. Tryptase may also activate prostromelysin, which in turn activates latent collagenase. When canine pulmonary smooth muscle is incubated with canine tryptase, the contractile response to histamine is increased. Tryptase, quantifiable in complex biologic fluids by immunoassay, can serve as a specific indicator of mast cell involvement in certain clinical settings. For example, after bee sting--induced anaphylaxis, tryptase levels in the blood peak at approximately 1 hour, then decline with a half-life of approximately 2 hours. Additionally, elevated tryptase levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of asymptomatic, atopic persons with asthma suggest ongoing mast cell activation, which may relate to adenosine hyperresponsiveness and a persistence of bronchial hyperreactivity. Tryptase levels in bronchial lavage fluid of atopic patients with asthma rise markedly after endobronchial allergen challenge but not after an exercise challenge, suggesting a lack of mast cell involvement in the latter condition.\n",

      "ABSTRACT It is children with atopic dermatitis who develop asthma more frequently if the mother smokes.We elicited symptoms of atopic dermatitis (AD) and of asthma from 620 children who were themselves nonsmokers, were aged 1 to 17 years, and had been consecutively referred to an allergy clinic. A histamine bronchial-challenge test revealed bronchial hyperresponsiveness in 95% of the children who had a history of wheezing or asthma and who could perform the test reliably, indicating that most of them did indeed have asthma. Children with a history of AD were much more likely to have asthma if the mother was a smoker than if she was a nonsmoker (79% versus 52%; p = 0.001). Similarly, if AD was found on examination, the percentages with asthma were 74% and 44%, respectively. By contrast, the children with no history of AD had asthma as frequently if the mother was a nonsmoker (42%) as when she was a smoker (40%). In children with AD, the prevalence of asthma was greater in both boys and girls when the mother was a smoker, but only in boys when the father was a smoker. Multiple logistic regression confirmed that the risk of asthma was greatly increased when the child had both AD and a mother who smoked.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Salsalate cross-sensitivity in aspirin-sensitive patients with asthma.Ten aspirin (ASA)-sensitive patients with asthma underwent double-blind, placebo-controlled oral challenges with salsalate followed by ASA-sensitive confirmatory challenges. All 10 patients sustained asthmatic reactions to ASA, but only two developed respiratory reactions to 2 gm of salsalate. In these two patients, repeat confirmatory challenges with 2 gm of salsalate reproduced the same asthmatic reactions. Both patients were desensitized to ASA, and cross-desensitization with 2 gm of salsalate was then achieved. We conclude that salsalate, a weak inhibitor of cyclooxygenase in vitro, is less likely than ASA to induce asthma in known ASA-sensitive patients with asthma but may occasionally cross-react in these patients.

      "ABSTRACT Immediate skin test reactivity to Food and Drug Administration-approved standardized extracts.In an effort to determine whether recently introduced Food and Drug Administration-approved standardized extracts produce clinically appropriate responses in a population, 200 subjects were skin prick tested (SPT). Thirteen extracts (10 pollens, two house dust (HD) mites and cat) were tested in three groups of subjects, 50 with a history of asthma or allergic rhinitis (AL), 50 without asthma or perennial or seasonal allergic rhinitis but with a positive immediate family history for these conditions (FAL), and 100 subjects without a personal or family history for these conditions (NAL). An SPT mean wheal diameter greater than or equal to 3 mm was considered positive. Ninety percent (95% confidence interval [CI], 82% to 98%) of AL subjects had at least one positive SPT. Forty-six percent of FAL subjects (95% CI, 30% to 58%) and 29% of NAL subjects (95% CI, 20% to 38%) had at least one positive SPT. More FAL than NAL subjects had at least one SPT (p less than 0.05), and FAL subjects had more positive SPTs than NAL subjects (p less than 0.05), further supporting the genetic regulation of allergen-specific IgE production. Of the five AL subjects with no SPT wheal greater than or equal to 3 mm, three subjects were available for intradermal tests. Thirteen nonstandardized allergens similar to allergens used for SPT were applied intradermally in each of these three subjects and were all negative. Compared with history, an SPT wheal greater than or equal to 3 mm to cat produced a sensitivity of 0.90, a specificity of 0.90, and diagnostic accuracy of 0.90.

There were 58 patients with an average age of onset of first asthmatic attack of 18.5 years and an average age when requiring mechanical ventilation of 33 years, which is significantly younger than among those who did not require assisted ventilation. At the time of intubation, four patients were in sudden unexpected arrest and 19 patients were urgently ventilated because of respiratory muscle fatigue or carbon dioxide narcosis; the remaining 52 patients required elective mechanical ventilation. The arterial blood gas of 52 patients revealed a pH of 7.11 +/- 0.66, PaCO2 of 58.0 +/- 5.5 mmHg, and HCO3 of 15.0 +/- 5.8 mEg/L. Controlled mechanical ventilation was maintained for a mean of 38.68 hours. Fifty-one patients required intravenous diazepam (average dose = 24.3 mg) and 37 required morphine (average dose = 11.1 mg) for good syncronization in controlling mechanical ventilation. Pneumothorax was the most common complication with four, nine and one episodes occurring prior to, during and after assisted ventilation, respectively. Four, one and two patients developed the complications of pneumonia, atelectasis of the left lung due to mucous plugging and upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, respectively.

      "ABSTRACT Endurance running performance in athletes with asthma.Laboratory assessment was made during maximal and submaximal exercise on 16 endurance trained male runners with asthma (aged 35 +/- 9 years) (mean +/- S.D.). Eleven of these asthmatic athletes had recent performance times over a half-marathon, which were examined in light of the results from the laboratory tests. The maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) of the group was 61.8 +/- 6.3 ml kg-1 min-1 and the maximum ventilation (VEmax) was 138.7 +/- 24.7 l min-1. These maximum cardio-respiratory responses to exercise were positively correlated to the degree of airflow obstruction, defined as the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (expressed as a percentage of predicted normal). The half-marathon performance times of 11 of the athletes ranged from those of recreational to elite runners (82.4 +/- 8.8 min, range 69-94). Race pace was correlated with VO2max (r = 0.863, P less than 0.01) but the highest correlation was with the running velocity at a blood lactate concentration of 2 mmol l-1 (r = 0.971, P less than 0.01). The asthmatic athletes utilized 82 +/- 4% VO2max during the half-marathon, which was correlated with the %VO2max at 2 mmol l-1 blood lactate (r = 0.817, P less than 0.01). The results of this study suggest that athletes with mild to moderate asthma can possess high VO2max values and can develop a high degree of endurance fitness, as defined by their ability to sustain a high percentage of VO2max over an endurance race. In athletes with more severe airflow obstruction, the maximum ventilation rate may be reduced and so VO2max may be impaired. The athletes in the present study have adapted to this limitation by being able to sustain a higher %VO2max before the accumulation of blood lactate, which is an advantage during an endurance race. Therefore, with appropriate training and medication, asthmatics can successfully participate in endurance running at a competitive level.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [123I-IMP accumulation in the lung with bronchial asthma--early uptake and delayed washout].123I-IMP is taken up by the pulmonary capillary endothelial cells during the first pass through the lung, and is slowly released from them. To look up the factors which influence on the prolonged 123I-IMP retention in the diseased lung, we examined the correlation between the 123I-IMP uptake during the first pass and the 123I-IMP retention. Patients with bronchial asthma had no abnormal finding in the chest X-ray photograph. However 123I-IMP release from their lungs was delayed. Some patients show a tendency that 123I-IMP uptake during the first pass was uneven, which suggested the change in amine uptake function of endothelial cells. However their correlation coefficients between the uptake during the first pass and the prolonged retention were very small. It was considered that the prolonged 123I-IMP retention in the diseased lung was not explained only by the change in uptake function of pulmonary capillary endothelial cell.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Pollinosis and bronchial asthma: pathogenesis, immunology, clinical aspects].Rhinoconjunctivitis induced by pollen exposure and bronchial asthma are generally easily recognizable clinically. In asthma a number of differential diagnoses such as ciliary dyskinesia, cystic fibrosis and gastro-oesophageal reflux must be considered. The predominant symptoms are coughing and wheezing. Investigations into the complex nature of mediator release and IgE synthesis have established a predominantly inflammatory pattern of reactions largely responsible for induction and maintenance of bronchial hyperresponsiveness due to both acute and chronic processes. Future therapeutic consequences may be derived from anti-inflammatory strategies. This has already lead to reassessment and upgrading of use of corticosteroids in paediatric asthma.\n",

Topical (aerosol) treatment is considered as the most effective route of medication; availability of new substances and new aerosols in Austria requires a revision of previously established treatment strategies. Such revised strategies are presented for schoolchildren, babies and toddlers respectively; they follow the same principles, but differ in respect to the preferred method of topical medication. In addition, coexistent allergy has to be evaluated and treated on an individualized basis; occasionally, so-called \"tertiary strategies\" of asthma treatment are employed as well.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus seropositivity in pediatric emergency room patients undergoing phlebotomy.Information on the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among children and adolescents requiring medical care is sparse. A small but significant risk of seroconversion occurs in health care workers who handle blood and body fluids of patients infected with HIV. The prevalence of HIV seropositivity in children who had phlebotomy as part of emergency care was measured. Of 749 blood samples, 21 (2.8%) tested positive for HIV antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western Blot analysis: 14 samples from 6 patients with hemophilia, 6 from 3 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related complex, and 1 from a patient with asthma. Of these 21 blood samples, 10 were from 4 children previously known to be HIV positive, 4 were from patients with a known parental risk factor, and 16 were from patients with known history of blood transfusion. One sample was from a children with unknown HIV status and no documented risk factors. Procedures included 9 venipunctures, 17 intravenous line placements, 1 lumbar puncture, and 1 pelvic examination. Most patients with HIV seropositivity had been known to be HIV seropositive or at significant risk for HIV seropositivity. Although the potential risk to health care workers from children without known risk factors for HIV seropositivity was small in this population, the currently recommended infection-control precautions should always be observed.\n",

Two measures were calculated on each of the five trials of the test, one of linear change and one of nonlinear change in reading times. As predicted, patients presented more frequently patterns characterized by high nonlinear change and less frequently stabilized patterns (low linear and nonlinear change of reading speed). Linear and nonlinear change were then calculated on the five linear change scores and the five nonlinear change scores; again patients presented more frequently patterns characterized by high nonlinear change on both the linear change scores and nonlinear change scores and less frequently stabilized patterns. These findings indicate strong similarities between the adaptation patterns of patients with ulcer and asthma and the microgenetic patterns previously known to characterize neurotic and psychotic patients. Furthermore, scores on the Serial Color-Word Test also differentiated between ulcer and asthma groups.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Dose-related effect of beclomethasone dipropionate on airway responsiveness in asthma.The effects of twice daily inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) at two dose levels (500 and 1,000 micrograms daily) on the airway responsiveness to inhaled histamine was evaluated by a randomized, single-blind, cross-over study in 10 patients with stable asthma. The 12-week study began with a 3-week run-in period of baseline treatment, which was continued unchanged throughout the study, and the two treatment periods were separated by a 3-week placebo period. Patients attended the laboratory every 3 weeks for spirometry and histamine inhalation tests to determine the provocative concentration of histamine causing a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (PC20 of FEV1). There was a similar significant improvement (p less than 0.05) in mean FEV1 after both treatments. There was no significant change in PC20 after treatment with 500 micrograms daily, the geometric mean being 0.587 mg/ml after the placebo period and 0.860 mg/ml after BDP treatment. There was a significant improvement in PC20 (1.930 mg/ml) after treatment with 1,000 micrograms BDP daily in comparison with the placebo and treatment periods with 500 micrograms BDP daily (p less than 0.001). These results suggest that higher doses than usual of inhaled BDP must be used to control airway responsiveness in asthmatics.\n",

In 42.89% of the patients the asthma was severe, in 47.07% it was moderate and in 10.09%--mild. 30.05% of the patients were with atopic asthma, 52.06%--with infectious dependence, 8.03%--with glucocorticoid deficiency and 2.98%--with hormonal imbalance. In all patients remission was achieved with a different reliability. Full remission was achieved in 24.08%, partial remission 1 degree--in 58.03% and partial remission II degree--in 17.89% of the patients. The duration of the remission varied from 2 up to 46 months. A remission longer than 6 months was achieved in 72.10% of the patients treated with intal or zaditen, in 61.36% of the patients treated with corticosteroids and only in 27.70% of the patients treated with symptomatic and general hygienic means. The duration and the quality of the remission depend on the correct selection of the therapy in the acute stage, the severity and the form of bronchial asthma. Better results are achieved in the mild form of bronchial asthma. The most frequent causes for destabilization of the remission were bronchopulmonary infections, incorrect reduction or discontinuing of the medication, formal supportive therapy, psychologic demobilization and irrational supportive therapy.\n",

In contrast, AHR to stimuli like hyperventilation, which act indirectly through mediator release, may be specific for the pathogenesis of asthma and predictive for a beneficial effect of GCS. The validation of this possibility requires the demonstration that patients with CAL and AHR to hyper-ventilation demonstrate improvement after treatment with GCS (and have an increase in eosinophils and metachromatic cells in the sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), like that seen in asthmatics uncomplicated by CAL).\n",

      "ABSTRACT Racial, social, and environmental risks for childhood asthma.Unlike a number of childhood problems, it is not clear that there are racial or socioeconomic disparities in the prevalence of childhood asthma. We analyzed data from the Child Health Supplement to the 1981 National health Interview Survey, a population-based survey with information concerning 15,416 children, to address the following questions: are there racial or socioeconomic differences in rates of childhood asthma; if yes, what is the contribution of social and environmental characteristics to the observed differences? In this sample, black children were more likely to have asthma than were white children (4.4% vs. 2.5%). Racial disparities in prevalence emerged early and at all childhood ages were due to higher black rates of onset between the ages of 1 and 3 years. Poverty status, maternal cigarette smoking, large family size, smaller size of home, low birth weight, and maternal age younger than 20 years at the child's birth were all associated with increased rates of childhood asthma. When available social and environmental characteristics were controlled for using multivariate analyses, the increased risk for asthma among black and poor children was reduced to statistical insignificance. We conclude that black and poor children in the United States do have higher rates of asthma, that social and environmental factors exert substantial influences on rates of asthma, and that much of the racial and economic disparity in prevalence can be accounted for by a variety of social and environmental characteristics.\n",

Virtually all studies on the LAR have been done during the daytime. This study evaluated the LAR as a function of the time of day an inhaled allergen challenge was performed. An allergen challenge given in the morning produced a LAR in 4 of 10 subjects, while the same challenge in the evening caused a LAR in 9 of 10 (p less than 0.05). The time to onset of the LAR following the morning and evening challenges was 9.4 +/- 2.0 h versus 3.1 +/- 0.3 h, respectively (p less than 0.05). The maximal decrease in FEV1 for the LAR was 32.8 +/- 5.6% for the morning challenge versus 43.0 +/- 3.1% in the evening (p less than 0.05). Additionally, the bronchial responsiveness to methacholine was significantly greater at 24 h following evening allergen challenge than after the morning (p less than 0.05) challenge.

      "ABSTRACT Computerized tomography in the evaluation of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a destructive disease of the lung characteristically associated with central bronchiectasis. This study was designed to determine if high-resolution computerized tomography (CT) could be used to define bronchiectasis in patients with suspected disease. Sixteen patients with asthma were studied. All demonstrated immediate cutaneous reactivity to common aeroallergens including Aspergillus fumigatus. Eight patients had clinical and immunologic evidence of ABPA. Six to 12 high-resolution CT sections (1.5 mm) were obtained at 1- to 2-cm intervals from the aortic knob to the dome of the diaphragm. All radiographs were evaluated separately by two readers in a blinded fashion and graded as to the presence and type of bronchial dilatation and bronchial wall thickening. Bronchial dilatation was seen in 41% of lung lobes in the ABPA group compared to 15% in the non-ABPA asthmatic control group. Upper lobe involvement and bronchial wall thickening was common to both groups. The presence of bronchiectasis in the control group may indicate that asthma is a more destructive lung disease than is currently appreciated. High-resolution CT of the chest has been shown in previous studies to have a sensitivity and specificity approaching that of bronchography, and the current findings support its use in the detection of bronchiectasis in patients with asthma suspected of having ABPA.\n",

A possible relationship to alpha 1-antitrypsin variants.A high prevalence of asthmalike symptoms was noted among patients of Puerto Rican descent attending Beth Israel and North Central Bronx Medical Centers in New York City, as compared with other ethnic groups. An evaluation of family and medical histories, pulmonary function data, and alpha 1-antitrypsin phenotypes was undertaken in such Puerto Rican patients and control subjects without asthma. The patients showed a higher proportion of MS and MV phenotypes. All the patients in both MM and variant phenotype groups, with the exception of four MM patients, had features indicative of asthma, with labile airway obstruction, and elevated serum immunoglobulin E and eosinophil levels. The latter was significantly higher in the patients with variant phenotypes than in MM patients. Patients with alpha 1-antitrypsin variants also had much shorter smoking histories as compared with the MM group, and all reported histories of asthma in first-degree relatives, as compared with 66% among the MM patients. We conclude that there is an increased incidence of asthma among Puerto Ricans in New York City, and that the antitrypsin variant phenotypes (specifically S and V) play a role in this incidence and its expression.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Long-term follow up studies of bronchial asthma in children. II. Prognosis and complications, treatment and allergic evaluations].A questionnaire on the prognosis of bronchial asthma was sent in 1988 to 1592 patients (1038 males, 554 females) averaging 20 years of age after 12 years' follow up. We reported on the prognosis and risk factors associated with asthmatic children in part I. The relation between prognosis and other allergic complications, treatment and laboratory data were investigated in this study. Eosinophil counts of more than 1000/mm3 and/or total serum IgE levels of more than 500 IU/ml (100 IU/ml in infants) indicated poor prognosis. However, the prognosis was not affected either by the allergens themselves or by the number of allergens determined by skin test and RAST. The prognosis was worse for patients with multiple allergic complications than for those without complications. Treatment may after the natural course of childhood asthma, but it has been difficult to evaluate the effect of each regimen over a long period. We compared the effect of hyposensitization (specific immunization) and non-bronchodilator antiasthmatic drugs (NBAAD), and found that hyposensitization alone gave better results than NBAAD and its combination. We had better results from hyposensitization over a period of 1 to 5 years than for less than 1 year or more than 5 years. We conclude that asthmatic children with risk factors should be kept under strict environmental control and given suitable therapeutic regimens to avoid the development of allergic diseases, the slow down of \"allergic march\", and to avoid intractable asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Clinical study on bronchial asthma patients whose bronchial hypersensitivity has been improved].In order to determine which factors would affect the improvement of bronchial hypersensitivity in asthmatic patients, a clinical investigation was performed on 42 cases whose bronchial hypersensitivity had been tested more than two times. The following results were obtained. 1) The numbers of bronchial hypersensitivity-improved cases was 16 while there were 26 unimproved cases. There was no statistical difference in age, sex, type of asthma, severity of disease at first visit or type of therapy between the two groups. FEV1.0% in the bronchial hypersensitivity-improved group was significantly higher than that in the unimproved group (p less than 0.01). 2) In the improved group, all cases (16/16) were shown to have become free of symptoms, but this applied to only 38% (10/26) in the unimproved group. 3) In the 26 cases who had become free of symptoms, the improvement index in histamine test and the ratio of improved cases showed a tendency to increase as the period during which the patient showed no symptoms extended. It was suggested that bronchial hypersensitivity in cases with higher FEV1.0% would improve more easily, and that the induction and maintenance of a symptom free state is important for the improvement of bronchial hypersensitivity.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Asthma and eczema in children born to women with migraine.Migraine and asthma have been reported to occur in the same person more commonly than would be expected if they are independent. The large Collaborative Perinatal Project provided an opportunity to see if children born to women with migraine or with the group of disorders characterized by asthma and/or allergies were more likely to manifest asthma or eczema in the first 7 years of life. Among children whose mothers had neither migraine nor asthma/allergies, 3.2% had asthma. Of children whose mothers had migraine, but not asthma/allergies, more than 6% had asthma. The risk of asthma among children born to women who had both migraine and asthma/allergies was greater than the risk associated with each maternal disease. The risk of eczema in children was not appreciably influenced by the mother's propensity to migraine or asthma/allergies. The results of this first study of migraine in one generation and asthma in the next lead to the conclusion that the two disorders are probably related.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Bronchial responsiveness to mite allergen in atopic dermatitis without asthma.Eight patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) without a history of asthmatic episodes and 8 patients with mite-allergic bronchial asthma (BA) were subjected to bronchial inhalation challenge with a nonspecific stimulus (acetylcholine) and an immunologically specific stimulus (house dust mite allergen). AD patients had a significantly greater concentration of IgE (p less than 0.01) and antimite IgE antibody (p less than 0.05) than BA patients. Nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivities of AD patients distributed from normal to asthmatic range. After allergen challenge, all 8 AD patients and all 8 BA patients showed an immediate asthmatic response (IAR). The mite extract concentration to induce an IAR was significantly (p less than 0.01) greater in AD patients than in BA patients. A late asthmatic response was observed in 6 out of 8 BA patients, whereas it was not observed in any AD patient. Our results showed that AD patients are less reactive to a specific mite allergen than BA patients in spite of greater concentrations of antimite IgE antibody. They suggest that this difference in the bronchial reactivity to the allergen concerns the difference in the onset of clinical symptoms and that a certain level of bronchial hyperreactivity to the allergen is a prerequisite for the development of asthmatic symptoms.\n",

This paper deals with a case of occupational asthma due to palisander wood dust (Dalbergia nigra) in a joiner who sanded and polished parts of musical instruments. The causal relationship was confirmed by a positive skin reaction to an allergenic preparation and a positive nonimmediate, late asthmatic reaction after inhalation challenge testing with pure palisander wood dust. A method of bronchoprovocation testing with an occupational allergen is presented. It proved to be a practical and advantageous method in its simplicity and single-blind application of placebo. It should, however, be used with great caution, in well-chosen cases in whom nonspecific bronchial reactivity is proved or recorded to be in normal ranges.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Nasal inhalation of the glucocorticoid budesonide from a spacer for the treatment of patients with pollen rhinitis and asthma.Glucocorticoid sprays are increasingly used for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and asthma. This therapy is highly effective, and side effects are few and mild. It was the aim of the present study to evaluate a physiological nasal inhalation technique, which results in airway deposition of the steroid molecule similar to that of inhaled allergen particles. Thirty adults with grass pollen-induced rhinitis and asthma inhaled the steroid molecule budesonide through the nose from a pressurized aerosol attached to a spacer device. Compared with inhalation of placebo, the treatment resulted in a significant reduction of nasal symptoms (P = 0.005), of bronchial symptoms (P = 0.005), but not of eye symptoms. In addition, nasal peak inspiratory flow (P = 0.0003) and oral peak expiratory flow (P = 0.02) increased. There was no difference between budesonide and placebo with regard to local side effects, such as nose bleeding, hoarseness, and irritation in mouth and throat. It is concluded that nasal inhalation of a steroid from a spacer offers effective therapy of pollen rhinitis and asthma without significant local side effects. This therapeutic modality may have advantages over the ordinarily used nasal and bronchial spray treatment in patients with both rhinitis and asthma, especially when conventional spray therapy is associated with local side effects.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Masqueraders in clinical allergy: laryngeal dysfunction causing dyspnea.The allergist may be called upon to evaluate patients with dyspnea that is labeled \"refractory asthma.\" In some patients, the site of origin of their dyspnea is the larynx. The diagnosis of laryngeal disorders requires a thorough understanding of the normal function of the laryngeal anatomy and physiology. Some patients with asthma may have a component of their airway obstruction in the larynx and large airways. Paradoxical vocal cord motion occurs when the true vocal cords approximate during inspiration, and although severe subjective dyspnea may occur, in most cases there is no evidence of hypoxia, hemoglobin desaturation, or an abnormality of the arterial-alveolar oxygen gradient. Provocative tests with methacholine are negative in this group of patients. Patients with PVCM are usually female and may have an affiliation with the medical profession. Many have psychologic difficulties, and the foundation of treatment is speech therapy and psychotherapy if indicated. Other disorders that may produce dyspnea from laryngeal dysfunction include Meige syndrome, abductor spastic dysphonia, and laryngospasm. Recognition of these disorders will expedite timely, accurate diagnosis and treatment.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Silk-induced asthma in children: a report of 64 cases.A total of 64 children less than 15 years of age with asthma caused by silk were studied. The diagnosis was based on a history of wheezing, positive skin tests to silk, positive conjunctival or nasal provocation tests, or serum IgE-Sw (silk waste). The average age of onset was 4 years 2 months. Sex ratio (M:F) was 3.6:1. A positive skin test is essential for the diagnosis. Conjunctival provocation tests were performed in 80% of cases because of reliability, safety, and convenience. The first symptom appeared an average of 10 months after initial exposure to silk. In 61% of patients, asthma was accompanied by allergic rhinitis but in only 14% of cases by conjunctivitis. In most cases, asthma occurred in winter, due to seasonal use of bed quilts or clothes filled with silk. Silk is a highly potent allergen. The average mean wheal diameter elicited by silk in prick testing was larger than two histamine equivalent prick tests. A cross reactivity exists among mulberry silk, and silkworm cocoons, batryticated silkworms, and silkworm chrysalis.\n",

The same cannot be found with other pollutants. Many factors may contribute to the seasonal variation of asthma attacks. We speculate that prolonged exposure (in terms of months) to low level SO2 is one factor that might induce airway inflammation and bronchial hyperreactivity and predispose to episodes of asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Diagnostic value of maximal exercise tidal volume.Though breathing pattern is frequently analyzed during clinical exercise testing, there is little information regarding its usefulness in the differential diagnosis of impaired exercise tolerance. This study tested the hypothesis that differences in peak tidal volume during exercise between patients with different cardiorespiratory diseases are related largely to differences in severity of respiratory mechanical impairment (vital capacity), not to differences in disease state. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, restrictive lung disease, bronchial asthma, and heart disease (mitral valve disease or left ventricular dysfunction) were studied. Subjects selected had one and only one of the above diagnoses. All subjects performed maximal (symptom-limited) incremental exercise on a cycle ergometer. Multiple linear regression of all subjects (n = 30) in all four groups showed a significant correlation between VTmax and VC: VTmax = 0.55, VC -0.09 L (r = 0.827, p less than 0.0001). The VTmax/VC (x 100) was (mean +/- SD) 44 +/- 15, 54 +/- 11, 56 +/- 11, and 54 +/- 12 for the COPD, RLD, BA and HD patients respectively. There was no significant difference between any of the groups. We concluded that differences in VTmax between different patients are related largely to differences in VC (ie, differences in severity of respiratory mechanical impairment), not to differences in disease state. Measurement of VTmax or the VTmax/VC ratio has little value in the differential diagnosis of exertional dyspnea.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Predicting the need for hospitalization in children with acute asthma.In an attempt to identify factors which influence the decision of physicians to admit patients with acute asthma to the hospital, we studied prospectively 200 children (age 5.6 +/- 3.1 years, mean +/- SD) presenting to our emergency room with acute asthma. The children were assessed on arrival, and on disposition from the Emergency Room by one of the investigators. After obtaining historic data, a clinical score was assigned, and oxygen saturation and pulmonary function were measured. Of the 134 (67 percent) children who were discharged home from the Emergency Room, five returned within seven days and one was subsequently admitted. The clinical score on disposition was the sole variable found to best predict the decision for hospitalization (sensitivity 73 percent, specificity 95 percent). Of the variables obtained at presentation, the resulting decision tree found the clinical score to predict the decision for hospitalization (sensitivity 79 percent, specificity 75 percent). When the individual components of the clinical score were analyzed, the degree of dyspnea, as assessed by the investigator, was chosen as the rule to predict the hospitalization decision (sensitivity 88 percent, specificity 71 percent). We conclude that the decision with respect to the need for hospitalization in acute childhood asthma, is in practice based mainly on careful clinical evaluation. Pulmonary function and SaO2 measurements, although helpful adjuncts in the assessment of acute asthma, do not appear to contribute to the identification of patients who need hospital admission.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Clinical dysautonomia in patients with bronchial asthma. Study with seven autonomic function tests.Fifty asthmatic patients and 20 healthy control subjects, carefully age- and sex-matched, were subjected to seven standardized tests to evaluate their autonomic status. Due care was taken to remove factors which could interfere with results. Of the tests concerned with the parasympathetic system, the intravenous atropine test (p greater than 0.10) and heart rate response to standing (p greater than 0.01) which measured the basal parasympathetic tone, did not show a significant difference. Tests requiring stimulation of the parasympathetic system, ie, deep breathing test (p less than 0.001), Valsalva maneuver (p less than 0.001), and carotid sinus massage (p less than 0.001) showed significantly heightened response. Postural fall of blood pressure (p greater than 0.10) and sustained hand grip test (p greater than 0.10), chiefly concerned with the sympathetic system, did not show a significant difference. Of the 50 asthmatic patients, nine were atopic and 41 nonatopic. When the results were compared in the two groups separately, we found that there was no alteration in the measurements except the intravenous atropine test which showed heightened response with atopic subjects (p less than 0.05). These results suggest that hyperresponsiveness of the parasympathetic system is an important factor in producing bronchial spasm in asthmatic patients, and atopic and nonatopic subjects do not differ much in their autonomic status.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Effect of inhaled methacholine on inspiratory flow.One hundred consecutive outpatients with symptoms suggestive of asthma who came to the Pulmonary Function Laboratory for a methacholine challenge test were studied. In addition to the forced expiratory maneuvers, forced inspiratory maneuvers were performed before and after the maximal response to methacholine. In 24 patients, the methacholine challenge suggested that they had asthma (forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV1] decrease greater than or equal to 20 percent). Six of these 24 patients also had a decrease in maximal forced inspiratory flow (FIFmax) greater than or equal to 20 percent and nine had a decrease in forced inspiratory flow at 50 percent of vital capacity (FIF50) greater than or equal to 20 percent, suggesting that bronchoconstriction can cause decreased inspiratory as well as expiratory flows.

      "ABSTRACT Relationship between LTC4 generation of hypodense eosinophils and bronchial hyperreactivity in asthmatic children.In 19 asthmatic children aged 6-16 years, the degree of bronchial hyperreactivity was determined in relationship to the concentration of inhaled histamine which caused a fall of the specific conductance (sGaw) to 60% of the baseline value PC60sGaw. At the time of lung function testing, a sample of heparinized blood was obtained from each patient. Eosinophils were purified and separated into a normodense and hypodense fraction by Percoll gradient centrifugation. After in vitro stimulation by ionophore A 23187, the leukotriene C4 (LTC4) content was determined in the culture supernatants. Hypodense eosinophils of the 13 children with a histamine threshold lower than 1 mg/ml generated significantly (p less than 0.01) larger amounts of LTC4 (0.8-36.3 ng/10(6) cells) when compared to 6 children with a histamine threshold higher than 1 mg/ml (0.7-12.1 ng/10(6) cells) and 12 healthy controls (0.4-8.2 ng/10(6) cells). Preincubation of eosinophils with platelet activating factor (PAF) induced an enhanced LTC4 production, not only in hypodense cells from both asthmatic groups but also in normodense cells from patients with severe hyperresponsiveness. These results are consistent with other results which suggest an important role of eosinophils, their activation by PAF and enhanced release of spasmogenic LTC4 in the pathogenesis of asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Immunoglobulins and allergy mediators in bronchial asthma.Seventy four young asthmatics were evaluated to establish the role of immunoglobulins and allergy mediators in clinical asthma. They were categorized into Group I (n = 38) or Group II (n = 36) when having mild or severe bronchospasm respectively. In some patients, reversibility of bronchospasm (n = 35), exercise challenge (n = 24) and intradermal allergy testing (n = 24) were also studied. Seventy subjects had raised IgE levels (greater than 100 KU/L) but these did not correlate with the severity of clinical or exercise induced asthma or with reversibility of bronchospasm. An IgE level greater than 1000 KU/L was associated with more number of positive skin tests. Group II subjects had a shorter blood recalcification time (p less than 0.01) and higher levels of IgG, histamine and serotonin (p less than 0.001). It appears that severe asthma is associated with activation of blood coagulation, and release of allergy mediators contributes to the evolution of bronchospasm. Total IgE predicts the utility of skin testing in asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Is allergic rhinitis more frequent in young adults with extreme shyness? A preliminary survey.Previous studies suggest that social anxiety, allergies and distressed affect may be interrelated in some persons. For example, extremely introverted patients experience a poorer course and outcome of allergies as well as greater degrees of distressed affect such as depression and anxiety than do extraverts. Patients with affective disorders have a higher prevalence of atopic allergy than the general population; families of patients with panic disorder and major depression have the highest frequency of shy children. Preliminary investigation also indicate that behaviorally inhibited Caucasian children (initially shy and cautions in unfamiliar situations) and their families have more allergies, especially hay fever, than do uninhibited, socially outgoing children. The present survey evaluated the frequency of self-reported shyness. The most introverted subjects had significantly higher scores on self reports of depression, fearfulness, and fatigue, as well as a higher prevalence of hay fever. The data support the possibility of a distinct subgroup of shy individuals with concomitant vulnerability to specific allergies and affective disorders.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Do large volume spacer devices reduce the systemic effects of high dose inhaled corticosteroids?When used in high doses, inhaled corticosteroids may cause suppression of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. The influence of the mode of drug inhalation on the degree of this suppression is not clear. Hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal function was assessed by measurement of 0900 h serum cortisol concentrations, a short tetracosactrin test, and 24 hour urine free cortisol excretion in 48 adults with asthma taking 1500-2500 micrograms beclomethasone dipropionate daily via a metered dose aerosol. Twelve patients had hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal suppression, as judged by subnormal results from at least two of the three tests or (in one patient) by an abnormal insulin stress test response. These patients then changed to inhaling the same dose of beclomethasone dipropionate through a 750 ml spacer device (Volumatic). The endocrine tests were repeated from nine days to eight weeks later in 10 patients. Comparison with initial values showed that adding the spacing device caused an increase in the median 0900 h cortisol concentration from 126 nmol/l to 398 nmol/l, in the post-tetracosactrin cortisol concentration from 402 nmol/l to 613 nmol/l and in 24 hour urine free cortisol excretion from 54 nmol to 84 nmol. The rise in serum cortisol concentration in response to tetracosactrin did not change. Evidence of persisting hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression was present in only four of the 10 patients; the most pronounced improvements in function tended to occur in those who had never required long term oral corticosteroids. The results from this uncontrolled study suggest that asthmatic patients taking high dose beclomethasone dipropionate may minimise adverse effects by using a large volume spacer device.\n",

The population of the area up to December 31, 1987 was 90,458 adults. The health communities were selected in a random way to comprise the central as well as peripheral parts of Prague 8. By means of questionnaires information was assembled from 70.9% of the respondents and after supplementation of data by various doctors the scope of information was 89.9% (7605/8458). For detailed examination 902 subjects were selected with \"confirmed\" and suspect symptoms of asthma. The anamnestic data were analyzed and pulmonary ventilation was examined (flow-volume), and depending on indication, also the provocation or bronchodilatation inhalation test, skin tests, and total IgE. The cumulative prevalence of bronchial asthma was 2.3% +/- 0.3% (174/7605). The highest prevalence values were in subjects under 20 years--3.5% and under 30 years--3.6%. The contemporary prevalence was 2.0% +/- 0.3% (152/7605). Nonatopic asthma was recorded in 54%, atopic asthma in 46% of the subjects.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Bronchial asthma and acid reflux into the distal and proximal oesophagus.The prevalence of pathological gastro-oesophageal reflux in children and adolescents with asthma was studied by 24 hour two level oesophageal pH monitoring in 42 subjects aged 9-20 years with moderate or severe bronchial asthma. The importance of oesophagobronchial nerve reflexes and of aspiration of gastric acid as triggers in asthma was assessed by studying whether episodes of reflux into the distal and into the proximal oesophagus were followed by asthma attacks. Twenty-one subjects (50%) had a pathological total reflux time in the distal oesophagus and six (16%) in the proximal oesophagus. Nine patients had pathological gastro-oesophageal reflux into the distal oesophagus together with symptoms of asthma during the day on which the recording took place. In three of them the episodes of asthma symptoms were significantly correlated with preceding episodes of reflux into the distal oesophagus, and in one subject to reflux into the proximal oesophagus. We conclude that pathological gastro-oesophageal reflux is common in children and adolescents with asthma, but it seems to provoke symptoms of asthma in only a few. Symptoms of asthma were more often elicited by exposure of the distal oesophagus to gastric acid, possibly by a vagal reflex, than by aspiration of gastric juice.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Practical diagnostic approach to anomalies of the aortic arch. Apropos of 31 pediatric cases].This analysis of 31 cases of anomalies of the aortic arch has confirmed the predominance of subclavian retro-oesophageal arteries and double aortic arches (74% of cases). The age at which the first clinical signs presented was less than one year in 75% of cases. Respiratory signs predominated with recurrent bronchitis (16 cases) and bronchial congestion (9 cases). These signs were not specific for the type of aetiology and were characterised by their chronicity and recurrent nature. Inspiratory and expiratory stridor was found on 8 occasions and was very suggestive of the diagnosis. There was a frequent association of asthma and anomalies of the aortic arch in this series (13 cases) with 6 cases of atopic asthma in early childhood and 7 cases of asthma in infancy. The oesophago-gastroduodenal transit was the key diagnosis which enabled the vascular anomaly to be confirmed. There was, however, a failure on 5 occasions with 2 false negatives and 3 cases where the wrong type was suspected. Fibreoptic bronchoscopy enabled the topography to be established more precisely including the degree of compression (in 14 cases) and showed evidence of associated tracheomalacia in 7 cases. Nuclear magnetic resonance was very helpful, giving a better definition of the anatomical type and of the relationship of the vascular arch with the oesophago-tracheal axis. Broncho-fibroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance make strong contributions towards the indications for operation.\n",

Children (698 white and 494 coloured) were randomly drawn from schools in the northern suburbs of Cape Town. Each child participated in a standard 6-minute exercise test and spirometric measurements were taken before and 10 minutes after exercise with a portable spirometer. The diagnosis of asthma was based on a questionnaire and personal questioning and included those children who, in the past or at present, suffered episodic or continuous airflow obstruction, which was responsive to a bronchodilator. The criterion for the diagnosis of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction was a 10% decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second after exercise. The prevalence of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction was significantly higher among white children (5.87%) than coloured children (4.05%). The sensitivity of the exercise test was 0.31 and the specificity 0.97. In contrast to the results of hospital-based studies, the negative predictive value of an exercise test (95%) was found to be greater than the positive predictive value (46%). It is therefore concluded that exercise testing is not a useful screening test for epidemiological use; it is probably useful as a challenge test for detecting asthma in the individual patient when the likelihood of the disease is high.\n",

We also intended to detect evidence which may allow to predict their future outcome, whether they would become asymptomatic or end up developing chronic disease. A direct statistical correlation was found between those patients who normalize their secretory IgA levels and their course in an asymptomatic state. Thus, if a child does not have any sIgA at all, the relative risk to get sick is 0.86 (86%), while in those having sIgA within normal ranges, the relative risk of disease decreases to 0.46 (46%), representing a p value less than or equal to 0.05. Among the analyzed variables and their influence on the fact that a patient may or may not synthesize sIgA, none of them showed a predictive value for bronchial asthma by itself. However, when sIgA and total serum IgE levels, were analyzed together (being the two variables demonstrating to influence), the probability of becoming asthmatic is much greater in the ones with elevated total serum IgE and absent sIgA. This group is significantly different from the one with normal IgE and sIgA levels (p less than or equal to 0.001). According to our experience in evaluating and controlling a pediatric patient with repeated episodes of bronchial obstruction and lacking sIgA, an immediate strict environmental control should be established in order to avoid all possible contacts with allergens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

The levels of total IgG, IgG1 IgG2 and IgG4 antibodies were significantly higher in the bakers than in the unexposed controls. The presence of anti-wheat flour IgG subclass antibodies in the bakers was correlated with various clinical variables including IgE levels, duration of asthmatic or rhinitis symptoms, skin prick test response, peripheral blood eosinophil levels, bronchial histamine reactivity and responses to nasal challenge with wheat flour. The IgG subclass antibody levels of the total cohort of bakers did not correlate with any of the measured clinical variables. However, among men specific IgG4 and IgG1 antibody levels correlated negatively with total IgE levels and duration of rhinitis, respectively. We conclude that IgG and IgG subclass levels to wheat flour in bakers reflect exposure, but that it is not related to any specific clinical situation.

Resistance was measured by both constant flow inflation and occlusion methods as inspiratory flow rates were increased from 0.66 to 2.0 L/s. Endotracheal tube resistance was subtracted from total resistance to obtain respiratory resistance. In contrast to the flow-dependent increase in endotracheal tube resistance, respiratory resistance decreased continuously as flow rate and airway pressure increased, except in four of six patients with asthma in whom respiratory resistance increased as flow increased. Mechanical airway dilatation, tissue resistance, stress relaxation, and time-constant inequalities may contribute to the decrease in respiratory resistance. In status asthmaticus, however, the effects of turbulence, noncompliant airways, and/or \"reflex\" bronchoconstriction may be sufficient to cause a flow-dependent increase in resistance.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Genetics of asthma and hay fever in Australian twins.The occurrence of self-reported asthma/wheezing and hay fever among 3,808 pairs of twins from the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Twin Registry was examined for evidence of genetic transmission by path analytic methods. The cumulative prevalence of asthma or wheezing was 13.2% and of hay fever, 32%. There were significant correlations in liability to reported disease among twins, and these were higher in monozygotic twins (MZ) (r = 0.65) than in dizygotic twins (DZ) (r = 0.25), and in male MZ twins (r = 0.75) compared with female MZ twins (r = 0.60). Analysis under the assumptions of the classic twin model suggested that there were genetic factors common to asthma and hay fever, with a correlation in genetic liability to the traits of 0.52 for men and 0.65 for women. These genes acted substantially in a nonadditive fashion in men but not in women. As the genetic correlation was significantly less than unity, this implied additional genetic factors influencing either or both diseases individually. The estimated heritability of these diseases was 60 to 70% in this population. Environmental causes of both diseases also were correlated (r = 0.53 for men and 0.33 for women). Cigarette smoking was only weakly associated with wheezing.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Prevalence of occupational asthma and immunologic sensitization to psyllium among health personnel in chronic care hospitals.Psyllium is a high molecular weight laxative that can cause occupational asthma among health care workers who prepare this product for chronically ill patients. The prevalence of immunologic sensitization and occupational asthma to psyllium is unknown. We investigated the personnel of four chronic care hospitals, including two where four cases of occupational asthma had been confirmed the year preceding the trial. A questionnaire and skin prick tests with psyllium and various inhalants were administered to 193 of 248 (78%) of the workers who agreed to participate. Seventy-five subjects (39%) had a history of respiratory symptoms in normal life and/or respiratory symptoms and/or rhinoconjunctivitis after handling psyllium. Six (3%) showed skin reactivity to psyllium. Increased specific IgE antibodies were found in 20 of 162 of the sera that were tested (12%). In the second part of the study, a histamine inhalation challenge was performed on 70 of 75 (93%) of the subjects with a history suggestive of asthma and/or occupational asthma and/or skin reactivity to psyllium. Twenty (29%) had significant bronchial hyperresponsiveness. The six subjects with a history suggestive of occupational asthma (n = 3) and/or asthma (n = 6) and/or positive skin test results to psyllium (n = 6) had significant bronchial hyperresponsiveness and increased specific IgE levels. They all underwent specific inhalation challenges with psyllium in the laboratory. Four developed bronchospastic reactions (two immediate and two dual reactions). We conclude that by including the initial four cases reported in the year preceding the initiation of this trial, the prevalence of IgE sensitization to psyllium was between 5 (skin testing) and 12% (increased specific IgE levels).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "ABSTRACT Identification of activated T lymphocytes and eosinophils in bronchial biopsies in stable atopic asthma.We have used immunohistochemistry and monoclonal antibodies to analyze the phenotypic composition and activation status of the cellular infiltrate of bronchial biopsies obtained by fiber optic bronchoscopy of 11 atopic asthmatic subjects (FEV1% predicted range 78 to 114), 9 atopic nonasthmatic control subjects, and 10 normal healthy subjects. Examination of mucosal biopsies obtained from both central (level I) and subsegmental (level II) bronchi showed that the highest number of CD45-, DC3-, DC4-, and CD8-positive cells were found in the group with asthma. There was a significant increase in the number of interleukin-2 receptor (CD25)-positive cells (a marker of lymphocyte activation) at airway level I in the asthmatic group compared with both nonasthmatic atopic (p less than 0.05) and normal control subjects (p less than 0.01). Eosinophil numbers were significantly increased in asthma at both airway levels and at airway level II in the nonasthmatic atopic group when compared with normal healthy control subjects (p less than 0.05). EG2-positive cells (an index of secretion of eosinophil cationic protein following activation) were found at both airway levels in the asthmatic group and at level I in the nonasthmatic atopic control group (p less than 0.05). When asthmatic subjects were compared with normal healthy subjects, there was a reduction in the number of neutrophil elastase-positive cells in the asthmatic subjects which, as a percentage of leukocytes, was significant (p = 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

In the four subjects, bronchial hyperreactivity was no longer detectable postoperatively by provocation with carbachol. Five asthmatics could stop medication of 1 to 3 of their drugs, five others were able to reduce the dosage of one of their drugs to 50% or more. Lung function and medication was unchanged in two asthmatic patients, one patient had to add a drug to his medication while showing an unchanged lung function. In patients with asthma and chronic paranasal sinusitis, endoscopic endonasal sinus surgery (together with flanking measures, e.g. septal correction) is able to improve antiasthmatic therapy in a high percentage.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Role of insects as inhalant allergens in bronchial asthma with special reference to the clinical characteristics of patients.The whole body extracts (WBEs) of 13 common insects from Delhi, namely Musca domestica (house fly); Sitophilus oryzae (rice weevil); Callosobrochous maculatus (pulse beetle); Anopheles stephensi, Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes aegypti (mosquitoes); Blattella germanica and Periplaneta americana (cockroaches: male, female and nymph); Spodoptera litura and Heliothis armigera (moths), were prepared to evaluate their allergenic significance in patients with allergic bronchial asthma. Intradermal (ID) tests were performed with these WBEs on 75 patients with bronchial asthma and 20 healthy non-allergic volunteers. An ID test was considered positive when the weal diameter was more than twice that of phosphate-buffered saline control and at least 6 mm in size and an erythema of more than 15 mm. In the patients 27.7% of the ID tests performed were total positive (1+ to 4+) as compared to 7.1% in the controls. Ten point two per cent of ID responses were markedly positive in asthmatics (2+ to 4+) as against none in controls. Of the 13 bronchial provocation tests (BPTs) performed on patients giving positive cutaneous responses, eight (61.5%) were positive. Similarly, RASTs were positive in 87.5% of the limited sera tested from the patients with positive ID responses. The patients with a positive family history of allergic disorders gave higher percentages of positive ID responses as compared to the asthmatics with no family history. Similarly, the ID positivity was significantly higher in patients with associated allergic diseases like allergic rhinitis as compared to the patients with bronchial asthma alone. Interestingly, we observed significantly higher ID response to insects in seasonal asthmatics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "ABSTRACT Platelet activating factor does not cause a reproducible increase in bronchial responsiveness in normal man.The reproducibility of acute effects of inhaled PAF on airway calibre, circulating neutrophil count and any subsequent increase in bronchial responsiveness has been studied in six normal subjects and compared to the effects of inhaled lyso-PAF, the inactive precursor and metabolite of PAF. PAF caused acute bronchoconstriction and a transient fall in neutrophil count on two separate occasions in five out of six subjects (minimum percentage of baseline values (mean): first PAF challenge; sGaw 69%, Vmax30 72%; neutrophil count 70%; second PAF challenge; sGaw 61%, Vmax30 74%, neutrophil count 63%). In one subject inhaled PAF caused bronchoconstriction and a transient fall in neutrophil count once, but a second challenge resulted in no detectable changes. There was no significant increase in bronchial responsiveness to methacholine in any subject studied on five occasions over a 2-week period following each PAF challenge. Challenge with lyso-PAF did not cause acute effects or any subsequent changes in bronchial responsiveness. These findings demonstrate that any effects of inhaled PAF on bronchial responsiveness in normal man are small and probably not of clinical significance. It would also be inappropriate to use this human model to study the mechanisms of bronchial hyperresponsiveness or for the preliminary assessment of potential new anti-asthma drugs.\n",

      "ABSTRACT House dust mite allergen levels and an anti-mite mattress spray (natamycin) in the treatment of childhood asthma.Natamycin, a fungicide marketed as Tymasil, is claimed to reduce house dust mite numbers and would therefore be expected to improve asthma in children with mite sensitivity. We have tested this assertion by a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. There was no significant effect on levels of Der p I in mattress dust between active and placebo groups at the end of the spraying period. Histamine inhalation challenge PC20, clinic visit symptom scores and lung function tests reflecting either large or small airways obstruction were also unchanged. Therefore this product is not a therapeutic option for mite-allergic patients using the manufacturer's recommended dose and method of administration. Other factors influencing the Der p I levels were also investigated. Of these, only month of measurement and bedroom wall humidity showed any association.\n",

There were no significant differences between the treatments in average nocturnal oximetric O2 saturation (91.9% during Th and 91.0% during Te), or the amount of nocturnal body movement, recorded with a static charge sensitive bed (total number of movements 146 during Th and 120 during Te). No difference between the treatments was seen with respect to assessment by the subjects of sleep quality, which was considered fair or good.

This pulmonary hypertension is not secondary to hypoventilation, as in patients with chronic bronchitis or pulmonary emphysema, since patients with bronchial asthma are hyperventilating. The pulmonary hypertension in them must be therefore classified as primary. It is probable that its origin is in an allergic vasoconstriction of the pulmonary artery, occurring simultaneously with the well known bronchoconstriction.\n",

The methods used included a self administered questionnaire, a histamine bronchial provocation test, and allergen skinprick tests. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness was defined as a 20% fall in FEV1 and peak expiratory flow at a provoking dose of histamine (PD20) less than 7.8 mumol on two occasions four weeks apart. The response rate was 98.0% and 99.2% in the two areas. The prevalence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness was 4.1% and of diagnosed asthma 2.4% in the total population. There were no significant differences in prevalence between the urban and the rural area or between boys and girls. The 11-12 year group had a higher prevalence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness (7.6%) than the older groups. Of the 125 with bronchial hyperresponsiveness, 12.0% were defined as having severe or moderate (PD20 less than 0.8 mumol), 26% mild (0.9-3.2 mumol), and 62% slight bronchial hyperresponsiveness (3.3-7.8 mumol). The severity of bronchial hyperresponsiveness was closely related to diagnosed asthma, wheezing, and cough, though half the students with bronchial hyperresponsiveness were symptom free. The most common allergens were house dust and house dust mite in the city, and hay dust, pollen, and feathers in the rural area. The odds ratios for having respectively slight, mild or moderate, and severe bronchial hyperresponsiveness were 5.9, 21.0, and 30.4 for atopy; 1.9, 1.9, and 7.3 for early respiratory infection; and 3.1, 2.5, and 5.6 for a history of parental asthma.\n",

The distribution of number of admissions per 1,000 of the population is irregular. The frequency of admissions is no higher for the large communities around Oslo, exposed to motorways, traffic and heavy industry, than for the more rural communities.

Of the 312 asthmatic patients skin tested, 29 (9.3%) had positive reactions (wheal greater than or equal to 6 mm) to rice pollen extract at a concentration of 10(-5) g/mL and the remaining 283 (90.7%) were negative. While eight (34.8%) of the 23 ST-positive patients were also RAST-positive, RAST was negative in all 34 ST-negative patients and 20 normals. Immunoblotting revealed three major allergens, with molecular weights of 16 kD, 26 kD, and 32 kD, respectively. Interestingly, RAST-positive patients showed IgE responses to most allergens but only a few of them had IgG antibodies, while normal controls had stronger IgG responses to the same allergens, particularly to 32 kD, but none had IgE antibody. The preliminary results of rice pollen protein induced-lymphoproliferation were not informative; thus, rice pollen proteins do elicit a specific response in asthmatic children and normals, but its pathogenic role in bronchial asthma needs further study.\n",

Twelve subjects (2.9%) were found to have asthma and 35 subjects (8.4%) SAR. There was no significant association between occurrences of asthma and SAR. The incidence of asthma correlated with DF-specific IgE levels but not with OG-specific IgE levels, whereas that of SAR correlated with OG-specific IgE levels but not with Df-specific IgE levels.

This report describes the development and validation of an asthma knowledge questionnaire for use in the assessment of asthma knowledge. Two groups of respondents were examined. One group was designated 'high knowledge' and the other 'low knowledge'. The questionnaire had a maximum possible score of 31. The mean score of 69 'high' knowledge parents was 25.3 (median 25, range 18-31). By contrast, the mean score of 69 'low' knowledge parents was 13.0 (median 13, range 0-21). The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P less than 0.0001). The questionnaire results were reproducible (tau = 0.94, P less than 0.01). Demographic characteristics such as education and socio-economic status were not important confounding variables. Face and content validity of the questionnaire were based on reference to published experience. Concurrent validity was demonstrated by the ability of the questionnaire to distinguish low from high knowledge parents. The questionnaire should prove to be a valuable research tool for the assessment of asthma knowledge either as part of an educational intervention or in a clinical situation.\n",

      "ABSTRACT A system to capture physical examination data suitable for paediatric practice.A method is described to capture data on the physical examination of children. A personal computer with a keyboard, keypad and screen is used along with a menu driven software package. Little knowledge of computing is necessary and the system can be used to produce hard copy when a suitable printer is added. Accumulated data may be transferred to a statistical package for future analysis. The method used to capture data from children with respiratory disease, particularly acute asthma, is described here, but it is stressed that the method can be adapted easily to data collection from the results of the physical examination of any system.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Once-daily theophylline in the treatment of nocturnal asthma.The efficacy and side-effects of individually adjusted doses of controlled-release theophylline given once daily in the evening (average dose 650 mg) were compared with those of standard treatment with controlled-release terbutaline 7.5 mg b.d. Thirty-six asthmatics with regular morning obstruction (\"morning dipping\") were studied over two treatment periods each of two weeks, according to a crossover, randomized, double blind design. Morning peak expiratory flow (PEF) was slightly but significantly higher with theophylline (363 l.min-1) than terbutaline (342 l.min-1). Feelings of dyspnoea on waking in the morning were also less pronounced with theophylline. There were no other differences between the treatment periods during the day or night, with respect to dyspnoea or any the other symptoms. Side-effects were mild and were reported with similar frequencies during both treatments. It is concluded than an individually adjusted dose of once-daily theophylline administered in the evening is at least as effective as conventional therapy with controlled-release terbutaline in preventing nocturnal and early morning asthma, when both drugs are added to regular medication with inhaled sympathomimetics and steroids.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Comparison of the efficacy and systemic effects of 4 mg and 8 mg formulations of salbutamol controlled release in patients with asthma.The purpose of the present study was to compare the efficacy and systemic effects of 4 mg and 8 mg doses of salbutamol controlled release (SCR) after single dosing and at steady state in patients with asthma. Fifteen asthmatic patients (Age 36 y, FEV1 85% predicted) were given SCR 4 mg and 8 mg twice daily for 7 days in a randomised double-blind cross-over design, with at least 7 days washout between treatments. There were no differences between the bronchodilator effects of 4 mg and 8 mg doses. There was no evidence of tolerance to the bronchodilator effects after chronic dosing. Morning and evening PEFR measurements also showed improvements during treatment with SCR 4 mg and SCR 8 mg, although there were no differences between the two formulations. Both doses of SCR caused significant objective tremor responses which were maintained after chronic dosing. The 8 mg dose produced a larger tremor response after single dosing, but not at steady-state. Subjective tremor occurred in 7 patients with SCR 8 mg, and in 2 patients with SCR 4 mg. There were no cardiac arrhythmias on Holter ECG monitoring. These results suggest that the 8 mg dose of SCR was no more effective than the 4 mg formulation, and was associated with more systemic adverse effects.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Investigation of the effect of ketotifen on alcohol-induced asthma: a case study.A male patient with bronchial asthma suffered severe exacerbation of symptoms after drinking alcohol and this was not prevented by treatment with bronchodilators. After taking 1 mg ketotifen twice daily for nasal obstruction, within 1 month there was no longer any exacerbation of symptoms by alcohol. Blood samples were taken and peripheral eosinophils were purified and incubated with beer antigen. Using a chemiluminescence method, it was shown that pretreatment with ketotifen dose dependently inhibited the generation of the highly reactive oxygen metabolite superoxide (O2-) by the eosinophils. It is proposed that ketotifen prevented the alcohol-exacerbated asthma attacks by inhibiting the release of tissue-damaging superoxide from eosinophils.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Acetylator phenotype in patients with allergic diseases and its clinical significance.The genetic polymorphism of drug acetylation rate in man is an important determinant of the toxic and therapeutic response to certain drugs. This polymorphism can alter not only drug effects but may be a factor influencing the frequency of the occurrence of some disease states. The aim of our study was to establish whether there exists any correlation between the acetylator phenotype and the development of allergic diseases. In patients with allergic diseases and in healthy persons as a control group, the acetylation phenotype was determined by the sulfadimidinic method. In the group of patients with allergic diseases without infectional factor 76% slow and 24% rapid acetylators were found. This predominance of slow acetylators was statistically significant (by using chi 2 test) with comparison to the group of healthy persons, where 49% slow and 51% rapid acetylators were observed. Considerable predominance of slow acetylators in patients with allergic diseases suggest that phenotype of slow acetylation may be a factor playing some role in pathogenesis of allergic diseases and may be a factor predisposing to the development of these diseases.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Adherence issues in the medical management of asthma.Asthma is a common chronic illness of childhood that requires coordinated efforts by children, families, and health care professionals for proper medical management. The medical management of pediatric asthma involves pharmacological and behavioral recommendations to both prevent and control asthma attacks. However, management of these attacks is hindered by failure to adhere to the prescribed recommendations. While the literature on adherence in pediatric asthma has grown over the past 10 years, few definitive statements can be made about causes and treatment. Various issues related to adherence and pediatric asthma are reviewed in this paper, including assessment methods, factors influencing adherence, and treatment strategies. Recommendations for future research are provided, starting with more controlled randomized studies.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [A novel liquid-phase enzyme immunoassay AlaSTAT for IgE antibody determination].To determine whether a novel liquid-phase enzyme immunoassay AlaSTAT for allergen-specific IgE antibody determination can be used to measure the absolute amounts of serum IgE antibodies, we examined the amounts of anti-house dust (HD) and anti-mite IgE antibodies in sera of 32 HD-sensitized allergic asthmatics and 14 normal subjects by this immunoassay. The amounts of anti-mite IgE antibody in serum measured by this immunoassay were found to be consistent with those assessed by the difference in serum total IgE proteins before and after the absorption with mite allergen (the value determined by this immunoassay was 113% of the latter one, n = 4). Neither nonspecific IgE protein (50 to 10000 IU/ml) nor the heat-inactivated blocking serum affected the measurement of allergen-specific IgE antibody by the liquid-phase immunoassay. There were strong correlations between the values of anti-HD and anti-mite IgE antibodies by RAST and those by AlaSTAT (r = 0.90, p less than 0.001 and r = 0.86, p less than 0.001, n = 46, respectively). Our results indicate that the commercially available liquid-phase allergen-specific IgE enzyme immunoassay can be used to measure the absolute amounts of serum IgE antibodies without interference of nonspecific IgE protein or IgG blocking antibody.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Study on the frequency and clinical significance of positive RAST for mould allergen in asthmatic patients].Recently, moulds are considered to be important allergens for bronchial asthma. To confirm this fact, 76 asthmatic patients (mean age 12.5, range 6-17 years) admitted to National Chubu Hospital were investigated for 16 different mould allergens by Pharmacia RAST RIA to measure specific-IgE for moulds. The results were as follows. 1) The frequency of positive RASTs (score greater than or equal to 2) varied from 4% to 21% depending on the allergen. Because 21 patients were RAST positive to one or more allergens, ultimately 26 patients (34%) appeared to be RAST positive to more than one of the 16 mould allergens. 2) According to the number of positive RASTs, the patients were divided into 3 groups, i.e. group 1 with more than five, group 2 with less than four and group 3 with zero. The ratio of patients with severe and moderate asthma to the total subjects was not significantly different between three groups before admission, but significantly high in group 1 and group 2 in order compared to groups 3 (chi 2(4)df = 18.81, p less than 0.005) one year after admission. This tendency was already apparent even one month after admission. 3) The frequency of positive RASTs for mould allergens was higher in patients with atopic dermatitis than in those without it. From these results, positive RAST for mould allergen seems to have considerable influence to intractable asthma and atopic dermatitis in young asthmatic patients.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Study on specific IgE antibodies in pediatric allergic patients by CAP system].The CAP system is a new method to detect specific IgE antibodies and is an advanced method of the traditional paper disc RAST. Our result suggests a significant correlation between scores obtained with the CAP system and those with the traditional RAST. Since specific IgE antibodies against multiple allergens can be measured with the CAP system, we studied 5 food allergen specific IgE antibodies (Fx5) in cases of infantile atopic dermatitis. This study indicates a good correlation between the Fx5 scores and clinical symptoms of these patients. Thus, it is concluded that the CAP system is useful for screening IgE antibodies against multiple food allergens in cases of infantile atopic dermatitis.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Posture and circadian variations in serum theophylline concentrations].We have reported that the morning mean rate of absorption (ka) in immediate release aminophylline tablet is significantly faster than the evening one without any obvious change in AUC, the distribution (Vd), the rate of elimination (kel) or the elimination half-time (t1/2) and this altered absorption is a cause of circadian variation of theophylline concentrations with sustained-release preparations. Now, we examined the effect of posture on theophylline absorption. Seven asthmatic children were given immediate release aminophylline tablets at the same time in the morning on two separate occasions. On one day they remained standing and on the other lying. Serum theophylline concentration was measured at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 hours after dosing. Mean theophylline levels were higher in the standing position at all time and only the mean rate of absorption (ka) was significantly faster without any obvious change in parameters of pharmacokinetics. This result was almost consistent with differences of day and night theophylline kinetics. We conclude that slowness of absorption in the evening is mainly induced by difference in posture.\n",

Both steroids slightly reduced the responsiveness to histamine.

      "ABSTRACT The relationship between bronchial immunopathology and hyperresponsiveness in asthma.Physiological and Immunopathological parameters were investigated in 15 patients with diagnosed asthma, and 6 non-asthmatics presenting with other chest symptoms. The 15 symptom-free asthmatics expressed bronchohyperresponsiveness with a mean provocative dose producing a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (PD20FEV1) of 1 mg histamine. None of the non-asthmatics responded to 16 mg histamine. Twenty four hours later bronchoscopy was performed and endobronchial biopsies were obtained. Histological staining of frozen biopsy sections revealed a mononuclear cell infiltrate in all 15 asthmatics, while only 1 of the 6 non-asthmatics showed mild inflammation. Monoclonal antibodies were used to identify subsets of lymphocytes, activation markers, macrophages, and HLA-DR expression within the peribronchial infiltrates. In all samples, activated T-cells and macrophages were identified and HLA-DR expression was found to be raised, but the CD4: CD8 ratio was highly variable. No clear relationship was found between cellular distribution and measured lung function parameters. A highly significant correlation was found between the level of HLA-DR expression on the infiltrating cells (quantified microdensitometrically) and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. These results show for the first time that a chronic T-cell-mediated immune response is present in the bronchial tissue of asymptomatic asthmatics, and that the HLA-DR expression promoted correlates with the hyperresponsive status. These data promote the hypothesis that a T-cell-mediated response contributes to a predisposition to bronchial hyperresponsiveness in asthmatics.\n",

The study group consisted of 80 patients (20 with sickle cell disease, 40 with asthma, and 20 with diabetes). All patients had been admitted at least twice in the preceding year, had their disease for at least 2 years, and were between the ages of 12 and 18. The control group consisted of 100 adolescents, matched for age and socioeconomic status, from local schools. All subjects completed a questionnaire compiled from the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Rosenberg Scale of Self-Esteem, and the McCutcheon Life Events Checklist. Adolescents with chronic disease had higher depression scores (p less than 0.001) and lower self-esteem (p less than 0.001) than their healthy age-matched controls. There was no statistically significant difference in life events between the chronic disease and control groups. Depression, self-esteem, and life events did not differ significantly among the three disease groups.

(N = 14). Airway response to histamine and methacholine was assessed as the provocative concentration (in milligrams per milliliter) necessary to increase the specific airway resistance (SRaw) (in centimeters of H2O times second) by 100% (PC100 SRaw). Airway response to hyperventilation of air and to hyperventilation of 0.75 ppm of sulfur dioxide (SO2) was determined as the provocative ventilation (in liters per minute) necessary to increase SRaw by 75% (PV75 SRaw). Challenges were performed on separate days before and after treatment, and salbutamol inhalation was withheld at least 6 hours before each challenge. Salbutamol and placebo did not change perchallenge baseline SRaw nor did they have any significant effect on the airway response to the stimuli. Salbutamol and BDP decreased the mean prechallenge baseline SRaw (SEM) from 7.7 (0.37) to 5.9 (0.28) (p less than 0.01) and significantly (p less than 0.01) increased geometric mean (SEM) PC100 SRaw for histamine from 0.5 (1.42) to 0.9 (1.53) mg/ml; for methacholine, from 0.2 (1.47) to 0.5 (1.51) mg/ml; and mean (SEM) PV75 SRaw for hyperventilation of air from 51.8 (2.32) to 58.4 (1.86) L/min.

      "ABSTRACT An immunologic and genetic study of asthma in workers in an aluminum smelter.The cause or causes of asthma among employees in aluminum smelters is unknown. We attempted to ascertain whether such workers who developed asthma differed in respect to indices of immunological function and certain genetic markers. Data were collected from 33 asthmatic and 127 nonasthmatic potroom workers. Asthmatic workers had significantly lower mean serum levels of immunoglobulin (Ig)M; however, mean levels of IgG and IgA, median levels of IgE, the capacity for recall of delayed type hypersensitivity, levels of immune complexes, and frequency of antinuclear or other autoantibodies did not differ from values for nonasthmatic workers. Asthma was found to develop on a background of atopy in 21 workers (64%), whereas there were no features of atopy in 12 workers (36%). Cigarette smoking had independent effects on immunological function. In respect to genetic markers, there was a higher frequency among asthmatic workers of the alpha-1-anti-trypsin deficiency phenotype MS, but the frequency of blood groups, Gm allotypes, or human leucocyte antigen types was similar. The study established that the profile of immune function, or genetic markers tested, did not differ essentially for workers in an aluminum smelter who did or did not develop asthma; however, there was an indication of heterogeneity in causation, as judged by \"atopy-related\" and \"non-atopy-related\" groups in the asthma population.\n",

The cellular responses were observed to differentiate 500 cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), excluding epithelial cells. The average frequency of each type of cell in the BALF of the elderly asthmatics was 65.7% for macrophages, 15.5% for lymphocytes, 8.9% for neutrophils and 9.5% for eosinophils. In the younger asthmatics the average frequency was 61.8% for macrophages, 17.1% for lymphocytes, 4.1% for neutrophils and 16.1% for eosinophils. A significant increase in the frequency of neutrophils in BALF of the elderly cases was observed in steroid-dependent intractable asthmatics compared to the younger cases (p less than 0.05). An increase in frequency of eosinophils in the younger cases was also observed, although the difference in the frequency was not significant between the elderly and the younger intractable cases. A significant difference in the frequency of each type of cell in the clinical type of bronchial asthma was not present between the elderly and the younger cases. However, the frequency of neutrophils in elderly cases was significantly increased in Ib. bronchospasm + hypersecretion type compared to Ia. bronchospasm type (p less than 0.05), and was more elevated in II. bronchiolar obstruction type (p less than 0.01).

      "ABSTRACT [Mortality of severe asthma in Danish intensive care units in 1988. A questionnaire study].The mortality due to asthma is gradually increasing in Denmark. In 1988, 209 patients died from asthma. Of these patients, 108 were under 70 years. Information about patients who died from asthma in Danish intensive care units (ICU) in 1988 was obtained retrospectively by questionnaires. 99% of all the ICU's replied. Eleven of the abovementioned patients died in an ICU because of inadequate oxygenation or ventilation. In cases where an anaesthesiologist was called to a patient with acute severe asthma, who subsequently died from the disease, the majority had developed cardiac arrest, when the anaesthesiologist arrived. The use of objective monitoring of the degree of pulmonary obstruction by use of peak flow measurements and series of arterial blood gas values is recommended. Hypoxemia, the main risk factor, might be revealed in time by measurements of pulseoximetry. If the arterial PCO2 is increasing, the patient should be monitored in an ICU in view of oxygenation and ventilation, and possibly mechanical ventilation.\n",

Older approaches including epinephrine injections, intravenous aminophylline, intravenous superhydration, nebulizer-generated aerosols, and oxygen have the disadvantage of binding the patient to the emergency room for future attacks. By stressing proper use of sympathomimetic metered-dose inhalers (often with a spacer), oral theophyllines, oral B-2 agonists, oral and inhaled corticosteroids, the 90% of patients well enough to go home after treatment will have had a lasting educational experience designed to increase their self-reliance and make further ER visits unnecessary.\n",

So IgG-subclass deficiency is a common finding in patients with asthma and obstructive bronchitis. Treatment with corticosteroids seems to promote low IgG-subclass levels, but cannot fully explain alterations of IgG subclasses. Today IgG-subclass deficiencies are regarded as an important factor in the susceptibility to recurrent infections. We think, variation in IgG subclasses may have further effects on the noninfectious inflammatory processes of asthma and obstructive bronchitis.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Asthma education: the perceptions of family physicians.Education and training are important for people with asthma and for their family doctors in order to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease, but the most appropriate educational strategies have not been clarified. This study was conducted as a needs-assessment survey to examine the perceptions of 193 family physicians in Sydney (Australia) regarding various aspects of asthma management and patient education. Part of this sample of physicians were subsequently involved in a communitywide asthma education program. Although the measurement of airway function by doctors and patients is the cornerstone of the national asthma strategy in Australia, only 43% of family physicians surveyed regularly measured airway function in their offices and most considered that their patients rarely used a peak flow meter. Most physicians agreed with statements suggesting that asthma education was useful but some felt that education could be dangerous, or might result in fewer consultations by asthma patients. These results have provided clear directions for educating family physicians about optimal asthma management. They also provide some insight into potential barriers to the successful implementation of asthma education programs.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [A case of successfully managed acute asthmatic attack by cervical epidural block during mechanical ventilation].A 47-year-old male suffering from an acute asthmatic attack was admitted in the morning. He was arrested on arrival. Following successful resuscitation, he was treated by using controlled ventilation with a Bennett 7200 respirator. Before starting mechanical ventilation, he was physically exhausted and had carbon dioxide retention (PaCO2 76.2 mmHg). The patient received dexamethasone 40 mg/day and theophylline 400 mg/day during the first 4 days. Despite the decrease in PaCO2 following mechanical ventilation, cycling pressure remained high (up to 50-70 cmH2O) even after 24 hours. Because of the risk of barotrauma due to high cycling pressure, we conducted cervical epidural block to reduce airway hyperreactivity to the endotracheal tube and endotracheal suctioning. Six to 10 ml of lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine was administered every 1 or 2 hours. Within 4 hours after epidural block, airway pressure decreased to 30-40 cmH2O. Since then, requirements of sedative (diazepam) have decreased greatly to 10 mg/day. The patient was successfully extubated 4 days after admission. Finally, epidural block was continued for 6 days without any complication. We do not know how cervical epidural block works to reduce airway pressure. It might be beneficial to manage patients artificially ventilated during asthmatic attack.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Placebo controlled trial of systemic corticosteroids in acute childhood asthma.In a randomised controlled trial 38 asthmatic children aged 2-11 yr who had not received regular oral or inhaled steroids during the previous year, were treated with a standard regime of nebulised salbutamol and intravenous aminophylline plus either hydrocortisone and oral prednisolone for 5 days, or placebo. The children were observed throughout their hospital stay and for 3 months afterwards. There was a greater fall in heart rates in the steroid treated group on the second day of treatment (mean diff. 16 beats/min) and at discharge (mean diff. 13 beats/min); p less than 0.025. Peak Expiratory Flow Rates recorded in 26 children, 13 in each group, showed more improvement on day 2 in those given steroids (mean diff 16% predicted); p less than 0.05. This difference was not apparent at discharge but 9 children treated with steroids were clinically wheeze-free when they left hospital compared with 3 in the placebo group, p less than 0.05. There were no differences in respiratory rate, pulsus paradoxus and arterial oxygen saturation. Trends in duration of hospital stay and relapse rate during the succeeding 3 months favoured active treatment. These findings support the use of systemic corticosteroids in addition to high dose bronchodilators to treat 'non steroid dependent' children hospitalised with acute severe asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Adenosine bronchoconstriction in asthma: investigations into its possible mechanism of action.1. Inhaled adenosine and its parent nucleotide, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) provoke bronchoconstriction in atopic and asthmatic individuals but not in normal subjects. 2. In clinical studies, histamine H1-receptor antagonists, cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors and the mast cell 'stabilising' drugs, sodium cromoglycate and nedocromil, protect against the effects of adenosine bronchoprovocation suggesting the involvement of secondary mast cell mediator release. 3. Adenosine and its analogues potentiate histamine and leukotriene release from mast cells activated by other stimuli in vitro, and may also increase net mediator release from mast cells by counteracting the inhibitory effect of circulating adrenaline. 4. Although adenosine fulfils many of the criteria required for a mediator in asthma, its importance is not fully understood, and the mechanisms by which it provokes bronchoconstriction in asthmatic subjects is far from concluded. 5. Two possibilities are that either adenosine acts directly on luminal mast cells to upregulate histamine secretion, or it acts to initiate neuronal reflexes which stimulate histamine release indirectly and possibly activate peptidergic and/or cholinergic pathways.\n",

This effect can more often be found during clinical exacerbation and is supposed to be reversible. The ciliostatically active samples of bronchial mucus taken from asthmatic patients markedly inhibit reactivation glycerol models of frog's ciliated epithelium. It can therefore be suggested that the found activity acts directly on tubulin-dynein complex of the cilia. In contrast to these findings, the ciliostatically active samples of bronchial of glycerol models and therefore possibly act through some other mechanism.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Cardiac asthma presenting as status asthmaticus: deleterious effect of epinephrine therapy.Epinephrine is a potent bronchodilator currently used to treat severe asthma, although there is no proven advantage of this drug over beta 2 adrenergic agonists. By contrast, as demonstrated here, the use of such a potent vasoconstrictor can worsen hemodynamic status when left ventricular dysfunction is associated with asthma or is the cause for dyspnea. We describe the case of a 60-year-old man with an history of chronic asthmatic bronchitis admitted for status asthmaticus. Bronchodilator therapy, including high dosages of intravenous epinephrine, failed to improve the patient and he was intubated and mechanically ventilated. Several hours later, a right heart catheterization revealed severe unexpected left heart dysfunction with a capillary wedge pressure of 45 mmHg and a cardiac index of 1.7 l/min/m2. Epinephrine was gradually stopped which resulted in a decrease in mean arterial blood pressure and an improvement of hemodynamic status. He was discharged on home mechanical ventilation. In this patient, ischemic left heart failure was revealed by a clinical picture mimicking status asthmaticus. Epinephrine, given as bronchodilator therapy on an empiric basis precipitated the patient into cardiogenic shock. Therefore this drug should not be recommended in face of the possibility of cardiac asthma or associated cardiac dysfunction.\n",

A study of admissions to the Hospital of Saint-Nazaire].To test the possible influence of atmospheric pollution on the frequency of asthmatic exacerbations we have looked to see whether there is a link between the number of daily admissions for asthma in hospitals in Saint-Nazaire and data from pollution sensors in the network of the Association for the Measurement of Atmospheric Pollution in the Loire estuary. The pollutions studied were sulphur dioxide, oxide of nitrogen (NOx) and non sedimenting dust (black smoke). The meteorological data (speed and direction of the wind and temperature) were also recorded. The study was carried out for 18 months in a retrospective fashion. During this period 372 hospital admissions were recorded in 229 subjects. The number of daily admissions correlated in a significant fashion with the level of black smoke (r = 0.149, p less than 0.001) and this result was particularly due to subjects who were less than 15 years old. In this group the frequency of hospital admission was doubled on those days when the level of smoke was at its most elevated. There was a weak link between the peaks of SO2 (r = 0.116, p less than 0.05). An analysis of the place of residence in those hospitals and the dominant direction of the wind did not enable us to confirm the role of the principal sources of industrial pollution, which were all situated to the east of Saint-Nazaire.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Effects of individualized aerobic training in the readaptation of the asthmatic child to exercise].There have been few works studying the effects of training in asthmatics and there does not yet exist any study utilising the idea of the individualization of training. This is why the aim of this study was to assess the value of the effects of individualised aerobic training on cardio-respiratory aptitude in the asthmatic child. This study was carried out on two populations of asthmatics, swimmers and non-swimmers matched for age, height, degree of bronchial obstruction during a remission and baseline of physical fitness. Each child in the swimming group was trained to a metabolic level corresponding to the ventilatory threshold. After a period of 3 months a second cardio-respiratory evaluation was carried out. A clear cut improvement (20%) of VO2 max was observed as well as a proportional elevation of the ventilatory threshold in the swimming group. The VE max, the VT max, the VT/Timax, the FC max and the maximal oxygen uptake were also recorded. On the other hand aerobic training seems to be without effect on resting pulmonary function, even if the clinical state of the children improved. In conclusion this study shows that aerobic training closely adapted to the level of each child, obtains an important and rapid gain in cardio-respiratory fitness which leads to a better exercise adaptation. In addition the progression of the ventilatory threshold implies an increased capacity for work without the appearance of hyperventilation. This enables an understanding of how aerobic training is generally accompanied in the asthmatic with a better respiratory comfort and argues in favour of the perfect efficacy of this type of reconditioning in the re-adaptation to effort in these patients.\n",

The survey questionnaires were identical to those used in a 1975 survey at the same school. The prevalence of reported asthma or wheeze significantly increased from 26.2% to 34.0%. This increase occurred in groups reporting asthma, and also those reporting wheeze unassociated with colds, but without a previous diagnosis of asthma. There was a tendency for a rise in reported wheeze in Europeans (24.3% to 27.4%) and a significant rise in Maoris (27.1% to 36.2%). The reclassification of other respiratory problems did not account for the increase. Data from this study provides evidence that there has been a rise in the prevalence of asthma in this New Zealand population over a time period of 14 years.\n",

Eight children died during intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV), and of the 23 survivors, three further children had subsequently died from asthma. Seventeen children were followed up for more than a year after IPPV. Sixteen still had symptoms of asthma and over half had symptoms every day. Ten cooperated with pulmonary function tests: mean forced expiratory volume in one second was 83% of predicted and geometric mean provocative histamine concentration (PC20) was 2.1 mg/ml. Since the follow up study a fourth patient had died from asthma. IPPV continues to be required for a small number of asthmatic children each year.

      "ABSTRACT Exposure to hydrogen sulphide and respiratory function.A study was carried out to assess possible effects of low concentrations of hydrogen sulphide on respiratory function. The cohort comprised 26 male pulp mill workers (mean age 40.3, range 22-60 years) with a daily exposure to hydrogen sulphide in the workplace, and 10 volunteers, who had asthma (three men, mean age 40.7, range 33 to 50 years, and seven women, mean age 44.1, range 31 to 61 years). The respiratory function of the pulp mill workers was monitored by measuring forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and bronchial responsiveness after at least one day off work and at the end of a workday. Bronchial responsiveness was tested by challenge with histamine. The 10 asthmatic subjects were exposed in laboratory conditions to 2 ppm of hydrogen sulphide for 30 minutes in an exposure chamber. Airway resistance (Raw) and specific airway conductance (SGaw) were assessed by a body plethysmograph, and the ventilatory capacities were measured with a flow volume spirometer. No significant changes in respiratory function or bronchial responsiveness related to exposure to hydrogen sulphide in the pulp mill workers were found. In the asthmatic subjects, Raw was increased by 26.3% and SGaw was decreased by 8.4% on average after exposure to hydrogen sulphide. These changes were not statistically significant. In two subjects, however, changes were greater than 30% in both Raw and SGaw, indicating bronchial obstruction.

      "ABSTRACT Adverse effects of inhaled corticosteroids.Corticosteroids have a significant role in the management of asthma due to their powerful anti-inflammatory actions. However, when given orally, they cause significant and unwanted side-effects. Early attempts to circumvent these side-effects were largely unsuccessful. Recently, new synthetic corticosteroids have been developed that have powerful topical action but weak generalised effects due to rapid systemic metabolism. These new compounds provide adequate control of airways' obstruction in almost all asthmatics. Oral candidiasis may occur but can generally be controlled by adjusting the frequency of dosage and changing delivery systems. In high doses, there is biochemical evidence of adrenal suppression, but the clinical importance of this is not yet clear and there is no evidence of a significant effect on growth in children. High dose inhaled corticosteroids have been shown to affect biochemical indices of bone turnover in the short term. The long term clinical consequences of this are still under evaluation. Inhaled corticosteroids have provided a significant advance in the management of asthma, but physicians need to remain alert for the possibility of systemic side effects when used in high doses for long periods of time.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Chronicle of an announced death: the end of intrinsic asthma].The word \"intrinsic\" asthma which is not usually quoted by French authors should be eliminated from the medical vocabulary. Similar past history, clinical symptoms, house or occupational exposure are found in all varieties of asthma. Histological features are the same in atopic asthma and late onset asthma, apparently non allergic. On immunologic point of view there are two types of IgE receptors type I on mastocytes, type II on inflammatory cells, with immunomodulation by IL4 and T lymphocytes. On the other hand, atopic status is an autosomic dominant inherited trait, with a gene locus on the chromosome 11 Q and may be transferred with bone marrow cells graft. Finally asthma appears to be a local variety of IgE hyperresponsiveness to environmental factors. These basic notions have practical consequences and legal aspects.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Changes in asthmatic patients' symptoms and lifestyles on institution of inhaled budesonide therapy.An open, multi-centre, general practice study was carried out in 1661 asthmatic patients to assess the efficacy, in terms of symptom relief and changes in lifestyle, of budesonide and to record objective lung function changes and any adverse events. After a 1-week run-in period on any pre-trial anti-asthma medication, patients received either 200 micrograms or 400 micrograms budesonide twice daily by metered dose inhaler for 4 weeks. Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) was measured by the doctor on entry, after the run-in, and at the end of the study and patients were asked to complete diary cards on a daily basis to record compliance, bronchodilator usage and the severity of cough, wheeze and sleep disturbance, and weekly to record 5 lifestyle assessments, e.g. physical activity. Analysis of data from the clinic visits and 1375 completed diary cards showed that PEFR increased significantly from 321 +/- 3 l/min at the end of the run-in to 368 +/- 3 l/min at the end of the trial; 77% of patients had an improved PEFR. Bronchodilator use decreased significantly from 4.2 +/- 0.1 times/day during the run-in period to 3.0 +/- 0.1 times/day at the end of the study; 65% of patients used less bronchodilator. Significant improvements were recorded in all the symptoms and lifestyle indices monitored; 76% of patients improved in at least 5 of the 11 assessments. Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 103 (6%) of patients: none was classified as serious or unexpected. No sub-group of patients was identified in which the results were at variance from the full sample. It is concluded that budesonide improves patients' lifestyle and ability to carry out normal activities, as well as improving PEFR and reducing bronchodilator use, in mild to moderately severe asthmatics treated in general practice.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [The role of eosinophils, neutrophils and lymphocytes for the development of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in a guinea pig model of asthma].To elucidate the role of eosinophils, neutrophils and lymphocytes for the development of bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) following antigen exposure, we have developed a guinea pig model of BHR. Guinea pigs immunized by repeated exposure to aerosolized ovalbumin (OA) were intravenously given metopirone, a cortisol synthesis inhibitor, 24 hrs before and 30 min before antigen challenge, and to prevent death from immediate severe bronchoconstriction, chlorpheniramine maleate was also injected. After antigen challenge with high dose of OA, LAR occurred in twelve of fifteen animals (80%) and the bronchial responsiveness to acetylcholine (Ach) was significantly increased. Histologic examination at 72 h showed a significant increase in the number of eosinophils but not neutrophils within the tracheal walls. However, there was no significant correlation between the change in bronchial responsiveness to Ach at 24 h and the number of eosinophil in the tracheal wall at 72 h. When guinea pigs were treated with Cyclosporin A or FK506, T-lymphocyte selective immunosuppressive agents, from the beginning of immunization period, both eosinophil infiltration and an increase in bronchial responsiveness were inhibited. These results suggest that eosinophils and T-lymphocytes may play an important role in the development of bronchial hyperresponsiveness.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [CA 19-9 in patients with benign pulmonary diseases].Although serum CA 19-9 is considered to be a useful and specific tumor marker for pancreatic cancer, some patients with benign pulmonary diseases show elevated serum CA 19-9 levels. We measured serum CA 19-9 levels of 156 patients with benign pulmonary diseases (55 with asbestosis, 11 with bronchial asthma, 32 with bronchiectasis, 16 with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), 13 with healed pulmonary tuberculosis (HPT) and 29 other benign diseases). The percentage of patients with positive serum CA 19-9 was 42.3% (14.5% in asbestosis, 27.3% in bronchial asthma, 59.4% in bronchiectasis, 81.3% in IPF, 61.5% in HPT and 51.7% in others). In some patients, serum CA 19-9 levels were as high as those found in malignant gastrointestinal diseases. Serum CA 19-9 levels correlated well with disease activity. Immunohistochemically, CA 19-9 was expressed in mucous cells of the bronchial gland and surface of the bronchiolar surface epithelium cells in benign pulmonary disease. Gel filtration study suggested some difference in molecular weight between the serum CA 19-9 antigen of lung cancer and that of benign pulmonary diseases. It is suggested that serum CA 19-9 increases in the case of hyperplasia of the bronchiolar epithelium cells or the mucous cells of the bronchial gland. We conclude that benign pulmonary disease is one of the factors that affect serum CA 19-9 levels.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Bronchoconstriction in isocapnic hyperventilation-induced asthma].It is well known that some asthmatic patients develop bronchoconstriction after exercise challenge (exercise-induced asthma, EIA). Recently, it has been pointed out that isocapnic hyperventilation also induces similar bronchoconstriction (hyperventilation-induced asthma, HIA) in the same asthmatic subjects. However, the mechanism of HIA has not yet been determined. In the present study, we performed exercise and hyperventilation challenge in the same patients and pulmonary function data and neutrophil chemotactic factor (NCF) in peripheral blood were examined before and after both challenges. Twelve asthmatic patients with normal pulmonary function data on testing days were subjected to exercise test on a bicycle ergometer and then isocapnic hyperventilation tests in subsequent days. Subjects breathed dry air from the cylinder. Isocapnic hyperventilation was performed by monitoring minute ventilation and each patient followed the same minute ventilation exercise. The reduction of FEV1.0 and time course of airway obstruction were almost the same after exercise and hyperventilation testing. All patients who developed EIA also developed HIA and other patients did not develop both EIA and HIA. Changes of Rrs, V50 and V25 and their time course after each test were also similar in EIA(+) and HIA(+), and in EIA(-) and HIA(-). NCF increased significantly after both challenges in EIA(+) and HIA(+) patient, although increment of NCF was much less these the increases of HIA(+). These data may suggest that the development of bronchoconstriction was compatible after exercise and hyperventilation in each asthmatic patient, however, the mechanism of HIA may differ from EIA, although NCF slightly but significantly increased in HIA, suggesting the possible role of a chemical mediator.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Pulmonary infiltration with eosinophilia possibly induced by cefotiam in a case of steroid-dependent asthma].A 37-year-old female with refractory asthma taking betamethasone orally (1 mg/d), showed a fever of 38.5 degrees C, productive cough and dyspnea. The chest X-ray demonstrated diffuse infiltration in the left lower lung field. The WBC count was 16,000/mm3 with 6% eosinophils. She was treated with intravenous drip infusion of antibiotics (Cefotiam 2 mg/d and Sisomicin 150 mg/d) for 2 weeks, and her symptoms and the chest X-ray findings improved. However, at the end of the therapy eosinophilia was noticed. Sixteen days after the completion of antibiotic therapy, she again experienced fever, cough and dyspnea. The chest X-ray again demonstrated diffuse infiltrations in the left lower lung field. The total IgE level, histamine and circulating immune complex titers were elevated. The WBC count was 14,700/mm3 with 34% eosinophils. Although a sputum culture yielded no organisms, many eosinophils were observed in the sputum. There were no clinical or laboratory findings compatible with allergic broncho-pulmonary aspergillosis. After the administration of oral prednisolone (40 mg/d), the patient showed rapid improvement with resolution of all symptoms and normalization of the IgE, histamine and circulating immune complex levels. The chest X-ray revealed marked regression of the pulmonary infiltrations. A microscopic examination of a transbronchial biopsy specimen demonstrated moderate eosinophilic infiltrations. It was compatible with the diagnosis of pulmonary infiltration with eosinophilia. Treatment was performed with prednisolone. The result of a lymphocyte stimulation test was positive for Cefotiam. An in vitro test was performed to evaluate the diagnosis of drug allergy in this case.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

In the patients with obstructive lung disease, central hemodynamic changes were found to be determined by the bronchial patency and independent of the pathogenesis of the obstruction. During a remission there was a significant reduction in total peripheral resistance as compared to the values seen in healthy subjects, whereas in moderate or severe obstruction there was a marked increase in total peripheral resistance and a decrease in stroke volume and cardiac output. A drastic bronchial obstruction was followed not only by central hemodynamic changes, but a fall in ejection fraction and a rise in left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes.\n",

Hypertension was established in 50% of patients suffering from the triad asthma, intolerance to acetylsalicylic acid and nasal polyposis.

Blood samples were obtained before and after treatment with aminophylline and/or hydrocortisone injections. We extracted LTC4 using a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge for the measurement of LTC4 by radioimmunoassay. The plasma levels of immunoreactive LTC4 (i-LTC4) of the normal subjects were 142 +/- 25 pg/ml (n = 7), while those of nonatopic type asthmatic patients with wheezing attacks were 208 +/- 68 pg/ml (n = 15) (p less than 0.01). Before and after treatment with both hydrocortisone succinate (100 mg) and aminophylline (250 mg), 6 asthmatic patients with wheezing attacks had a mean plasma level of i-LTC4 181 +/- 24 and 132 +/- 18 pg/ml (p less than 0.01), respectively. On the other hand, the treatment with aminophylline 250 mg alone increased the i-LTC4 levels from 178 +/- 19 pg/mg to 213 +/- 16 pg/mg (n = 6)(p less than 0.05), while treatment with hydrocortisone succinate 100 mg decreased the i-LTC4 level 0.05 from 284 +/- 99 pg/ml to 249 +/- 85 pg/ml (n = 4)(p less than 0.05). In conclusion, the present study shows that the i-LTC4 level in venous blood of patients with asthmatic attacks is decreased significantly by treatment with hydrocortisone succinate.\n",

These actions, however, may be blocked by propranolol. Besides, these coumarins cannot increase the heart rate and arterial blood pressure in anesthetized rats.

The study began between 6 and 24 hours after admission to hospital; 19 children received chest physical therapy (PT) and 19 children received placebo visits. Each child had 4 treatments over 2 days which were preceded by nebulized salbutamol. Lung volumes and flow rates were measured in a body plethysmograph before salbutamol and before and after either PT or placebo on the first and fourth treatments. Throughout the study standard asthma drug therapy was given. In both groups characteristics such as sex, race, age, height, weight, severity, and baseline lung function were similar. Taking into account the baseline, lung function at the end of the study was similar in both groups. Three 12 year old children in the PT group showed improvements in flows above those seen in any children in the placebo group.

After an initial treatment period of 2 weeks placebo and budesonide were randomly administered during two consecutive treatment periods of 1 month. The progress of the patients was monitored using diary score cards, the number of salbutamol doses needed during the treatment periods, clinical examinations using standardized scoring cards, and registration of parents' preference period. Although there was a tendency toward fewer wheezing periods during budesonide, the results of the diary score cards were not significantly different between the budesonide period and the placebo period. The number of salbutamol doses used was also the same during both periods. Clinical examination after budesonide revealed less rhinitis and a less pathological lung auscultation, but the difference between the two periods was also not significant. Furthermore, the parents' preference could not distinguish between budesonide and placebo. We conclude that the trends in favor of nebulized budesonide are not significant and do not suggest that the suspension is effective in severe infantile asthma.\n",

Only one 12-years old girl suffered an attack of bronchial asthma while using a cold shower, probably as a result of breathing cold air. No other complications have been observed. Sauna bathing can be recommended for children with bronchial asthma, since advantages in the resistance against infections and in psychosocial development can be expected.\n",

We investigated 60 healthy and 66 asthmatic children by forced oscillation, plethysmography and spirometry. Mean FEV1% pred was 99.7 and 82.4% in the healthy and asthmatic subjects, respectively, and mean SRaw was 0.68 and 1.18 kPa*s, respectively. Forced oscillation and plethysmography could be measured in all children, whereas 29% of the investigated children failed to perform valid spirometry. Discriminant analysis was used to compare the optimal classification which could be obtained from the measured data with the clinical one. Fixing specificity to 95%, we computed sensitivities of 66% (forced oscillation), 68% (body plethysmography), and 76% (spirometry). We conclude that the diagnostic value of the three methods in young children with asthma is similar. However, the value of spirometry is limited by cooperation in these young children.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The effect of fresh orange juice on bronchial hyperreactivity in asthmatic subjects.We studied 16 mild stable asthmatic subjects to determine if orange juice increases nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivity (NSBH). In 9 subjects, bronchial responsiveness to histamine was assessed before and after water ingestion on the control day, and orange ingestion on a consecutive day. The mean (+/- SD) ratio of log10 PD20 FEV1 after water: log10 PD20 FEV1 before water (1.00 +/- 0.13) was not significantly different from the mean (+/- SD) ratio of log10 PD20 FEV1 after orange: log10 PD20 FEV1 before orange (0.97 +/- 0.12). To avoid the possibility of histamine tachyphylaxis, 7 subjects participated in a second protocol in which histamine PD20 FEV1 was determined on a control day (geometric mean 0.11 mg.) and again two days later, thirty minutes after ingestion of orange juice (geometric mean 0.06 mg). There was no significant difference in the PD20 FEV1 (p = 0.344). Our data show that ingestion of fresh orange juice per se did not heighten NSBH in our subjects. (PD20 FEV1 is the dose of histamine required to produce a twenty percent fall in forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1]).\n",

      "ABSTRACT Perception of breathlessness during bronchoconstriction induced by antigen, exercise, and histamine challenges.Perception of breathlessness was studied in eight patients with mild, stable asthma after a histamine and exercise challenge performed before and 24 and 48 hours respectively after an antigen challenge. FEV1 and perception of breathlessness, evaluated by Borg's 10 point category scale, were measured after each administration of doubling antigen or histamine concentrations to achieve a greater than 20% fall in FEV1, and after six minutes of steady state exercise at 80% of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max). The geometric mean provocative concentration of histamine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20) fell from 1.67 mg/ml before antigen challenge to 0.52 mg/ml 24 hours after the challenge. The median maximal % fall in FEV1 with exercise was 24.9% (range 10.5-40.5%) before and 30.6% (range 13.8-52.3%) 48 hours after antigen challenge. The median maximum % fall in FEV1 after antigen inhalation was 20.1% (range 13.3-35.2%) within the first hour; only two subjects had a late fall in FEV1 (23% and 58%). The median (range) of Borg scores obtained when FEV1 was reduced by 20% did not differ significantly for the three types of acute challenges: 1.25 (0.5-2.5) and 1.0 (0.5-3.0) after histamine tests, 1.0 (0.5-4.1) and 1.55 (0.5-2.0) after exercise, and 1.5 (0-3.0) after antigen challenge. In the two subjects who had a late response to antigen the Borg score was reduced for the same % fall in FEV1 as with the early response. It is concluded that the perception of breathlessness does not differ appreciably during the early response to histamine, antigen exposure, or exercise, but that it is reduced during the late asthmatic response. It was not influenced by previous antigen exposure, despite an increase in airway responsiveness.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Analysis of bronchial reactivity in epidemiological studies.The measurement of bronchial reactivity in epidemiological studies has the advantage of quantifying an objective physiological feature of asthma. Bronchial reactivity was developed in a clinical setting and has been conventionally expressed as the dose of agonist producing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PD20). As PD20 can be estimated for less than 20% of subjects in general community surveys with the doses of agonist that are usually given, data from most subjects must be censored. Thus PD20 alone is a poor index of bronchial reactivity for epidemiological studies. Data from 809 aluminium smelter workers were used to evaluate alternative methods of analysing bronchial reactivity. Dose-response relationships were analysed by four methods: (1) PD20 by the conventional method of interpolating the dose on a logarithmic scale between the last two measurements of FEV1; (2) PD20 (with allowance for extrapolation), estimated by fitting an exponential curve to the dose-response data; (3) the linear regression slope between dose and FEV1 when significant; (4) the dose-response slope obtained in all subjects as the % change in FEV1 from baseline in response to total dose. When each of these measures was related to symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of asthma, all differentiated between \"asthmatic\" and \"non-asthmatic\" subjects. The dose-response slope (method 4) had the advantages of simplicity and no censored data, and was shown to be clinically relevant. It is suggested that the dose-response slope should be used for the analysis of bronchial reactivity in epidemiological studies.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Lung function 8-18 years after intermittent positive pressure ventilation for hyaline membrane disease.Lung function and respiratory symptoms were studied in 40 children aged 8-18 years who had been ventilated for hyaline membrane disease after birth; 11 had had bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Also studied were 38 age matched children who had had hyaline membrane disease but had not required ventilation, 25 unmatched children who were born prematurely but did not develop hyaline membrane disease, and 39 randomly selected pupils of similar age. There was no difference in thoracic gas volume, total lung capacity, inspiratory vital capacity, residual volume, or transfer factor for carbon monoxide between the groups. Respiratory symptoms during the three years before the study and the frequency of clinically diagnosed asthma in patients and their family were similar in all the children with hyaline membrane disease irrespective of whether they had been ventilated or had had bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, however, had a lower forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) before bronchodilator (73% predicted) than the other groups (88-95% predicted). Children who had required ventilation had lower values for specific airways conductance (sGaw) and a greater increase in FEV1 (delta FEV1) after salbutamol (13%) than non-ventilated children (6%); delta FEV1 was associated with the peak pressure of intermittent positive pressure ventilation, a family history of asthma and a history of wheezing, recurrent respiratory illnesses, and a doctor's diagnosis of asthma during the three years before the study. These findings indicate that after eight years of age patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia have more reversible airways obstruction, compatible with increased bronchial smooth muscle tone.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Nikolai Astrup and his asthma].Nikolai Astrup (1880-1928) is recognized as one of the most famous Norwegian painters of his time. He grew up in Jłlster, in the western part of Norway, and has become known as the painter of the West Coast, not only because of his landscapes but even more so because of the atmosphere and special mood reflected in his paintings. Most of his paintings depict scenes from spring and summer nights in Jłlster. From a medical point of view it is interesting to know that Astrup suffered from asthma all his life, and one wonders whether his motives appeared to him during long walks at night while plagued by severe attacks of asthma. One also wonders what sort of impact the disease had on the composition of his paintings. There is reason to believe that his asthma not only hampered his creative activity and brought his life to a premature end, but also influenced his visionary imagination and helped him to discover the motives for his pictures.\n",

For analysis, technique scores were rated as 'good' (score 4 out of 4), 'adequate' (score 3 or 4) and 'inadequate' (score 2 or less). Overall, 25% of patients had inadequate technique. Of all devices, the Turbohaler had the highest proportion of patients with good technique (78%), and metered dose inhalers the lowest (45%). This audit confirms that technique is unsatisfactory for a significant proportion of patients, regardless of the device used.

      "ABSTRACT Why asthmatic patients should not sleep in the right lateral decubitus position.The topographical points affecting nasal resistance include the shoulders, upper thorax and buttocks, and we have demonstrated that vagal tone increases with right-sided pressure and decreases with left. We would therefore strongly recommend that asthmatic patients should avoid sleeping in the right lateral decubitus position. It would be interesting to speculate on a number of ramifications ensuing from the presence of increased vagal tone in asthmatic patients. If present, atrophic rhinitis, nasal polyps, and septal deviation may possibly affect incidence of asthma depending upon its presentation in the left or right nasal turbinate. We suggest that there should be increased incidence of right septal deviation and increased incidence of right turbinate nasal polyps in patients presenting with asthma. Patients with asthma may possibly have certain nasal cycle patterns that could easily be measured using Podoshin plates. Finally, our animal model of forced unilateral nostril breathing may explain certain facets of asthma.\n",

Bradykinin (BK) instilled directly into the airway lumen caused bronchoconstriction in anaesthetized, mechanically ventilated guinea-pigs in the presence of propranolol (1 mg kg-1 i.v.). The geometric mean dose of BK required to produce 100% increase in airway opening pressure (PD100) was 22.9 nmol (95% c.i. 11.7-44.6 nmol). 2. The dose-response curve for the effect of instilled BK was significantly shifted to the left by the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril (5 and 50 nmol instillation, PD100 = 3.0, 95% c.i. 0.98-8.9, and 2.0 nmol, 95% c.i. 0.65-6.2 nmol, respectively). 3. The neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitor, phosphoramidon (5 and 50 nmol instillation) also shifted the dose-response curve for the effect of instilled BK; the PD100 values = 2.2 (95% c.i. 0.40-11.7) and 1.8 nmol (95% c.i. 0.87-3.5 nmol), respectively. 4. After pretreatment with captopril (50 nmol) and phosphoramidon (50 nmol) in combination, the dose-response curve for the effect of instilled BK (PD100 = 1.1 nmol, 95% c.i. 0.37-3.2 nmol) was similar to that obtained in the presence of each inhibitor used alone. 5. The kinase I inhibitor, DL-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethylthiopropionic acid (50 nmol instillation) failed to alter the dose-response curve to instilled BK (PD100 = 14.6 nmol, 95% c.i. 6.7-32.0 nmol). 6. These data suggest that both ACE and NEP degrade BK in the airway lumen, but that kininase I is not involved.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Relationship between bronchial reactivity to inhaled acetylcholine, eosinophil infiltration and a widening of the intercellular space in patients with asthma].The hypothesis that epithelial damage is related to the development of bronchial hyperreactivity has been supported by many studies. Therefore, we further examined whether or not subjects with bronchial epithelium damage showed increased bronchial responsiveness. We took biopsy specimens of the airway mucosa from 20 asthmatic patients with various degrees of disease severity and bronchial hyperreactivity by using a bronchofiber scope. The morphology of the biopsy specimens was studied by electron microscopy. Bronchoscopy was carried out after local anesthesia. Specimens of bronchial mucosa were obtained from 20 asthmatic patients (14 males, 6 females) in remission. The electronmicroscopic studies showed widening of the intercellular space between the epithelial cells and openings of the tight junctions, as well as infiltrations of eosinophils and their granules beneath and between epithelial cells. The tight junction refers to the space between epithelial cells exposed to the airway surface, leading down to the intercellular space. The intercellular space refers to the space between epithelial cells, below the tight junction. Interestingly, eosinophils and their granules were found mainly in the widened intercellular space. The incidence of a widening of the intercellular space was higher in specimens showing eosinophil infiltration than in those not showing eosinophil infiltration. A significant correlation was found between the respiratory threshold to acetylcholine and the percentage of opened tight junctions (r = -0.47, p less than 0.05) and/or the widening of the space between epithelial cells (r = -0.65, p less than 0.01). These results suggest that widening of the intercellular space may be caused by infiltrations of eosinophils and that this widening increases bronchial reactivity.\n",

Patients were assessed by spirometry after the morning dose of medication at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment. After initial dosing, the mean percentage increases in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) were significantly higher in the tulobuterol-treated patients than in the albuterol-treated patients: at 30 minutes after dosing, the mean increase was 17.2% in the tulobuterol group and 5% in the albuterol group; at one hour, 20.3% and 6.8%. Similar results were found at 12 weeks. Mean changes in forced vital capacity and peak expiratory flow rate were similar to the changes in FEV1. Treatment side effects were reported by seven tulobuterol-treated patients and by four albuterol-treated patients. Tulobuterol treatment was withdrawn in one patient because of severe vomiting and headache of unknown cause. No changes in cardiovascular function were found in any patient.

      "ABSTRACT Generation of oxygen free radicals from blood eosinophils from asthma patients after stimulation with PAF or phorbol ester.Eosinophils (EOS) may play an important role in the pathophysiology of bronchial asthma because they can release oxygen free radicals and several basic proteins which are cytotoxic to bronchial epithelium. We have studied the response of EOS isolated from the blood of atopic subjects with symptoms of asthma (AS, n = 7) or rhinitis (AR, n = 4) or without symptoms (AA, n = 5) and of subjects with the hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES, n = 5). EOS were separated using metrizamide density gradients and activated in vitro with platelet-activating factor (PAF, 100 nM) or phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA, 100 nM). Oxygen free radical generation was assessed by a lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence (CL) assay. EOS purity was 83 +/- 1.7% (mean +/- SEM) with greater than 95% viability. Background CL responses of EOS from HES were significantly higher than those from AA (p less than 0.01) and AR (p less than 0.05). Normodense EOS from AS (PAF-induced CL = 90 +/- 27 mV) were more responsive to PAF than were those from AR (17 +/- 13 mV, p less than 0.01) and from AA (23 +/- 14 mV, p less than 0.01). Similar results were obtained with PMA. Hypodense EOS from HES subjects were as responsive as normodense EOS from AS to PMA and PFA. Thus, EOS from AS have an enhanced potential for activation, particularly by PAF; this may represent an important mechanism for the perpetuation of the inflammatory response in asthma, since EOS can also release PAF.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The relative contribution of bronchoalveolar macrophages and neutrophils to lucigenin- and luminol-amplified chemiluminescence.The relationship between differential cell counts and latex-stimulated luminol and lucigenin-amplified chemiluminescence (CL) was investigated by mixing alveolar macrophages (AM) obtained at bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) with allogeneic peripheral blood neutrophils (PMN) in varying proportions. In 5 non-asthmatic subjects, the mean luminol-amplified CL increased linearly from 2.1 (0.9 SEM) x 10(5) counts per second (cps) with less than 2% PMN, greater than 96% AM to 47.3 (11.1 SEM) x 10(5) cps with greater than 94% PMN, 0% AM (r = 0.996, p less than 0.001). The regression had a y-intercept indistinguishable from 0 cps, suggesting that luminol-amplified CL exclusively reflected PMN activity. Using the same technique, the mean lucigenin-amplified CL showed a fall from 35 (2.3 SEM) x 10(5) cps with a cell population of greater than 96% AM, less than 2% PMN to 20 (2.3 SEM) x 10(5) cps with 0% AM, greater than 94% PMN. Both PMN and AM appeared to contribute to lucigenin-amplified CL, with AM contributing approximately 1.7 times as much activity per cell as PMN. Lucigenin-amplified CL appeared to be an appropriate technique for measuring AM activity when the proportion of PMN in mixed cell populations was small. A linear relationship was found between percent PMN count and luminol-amplified CL measured in a mixed BAL cell population from asthmatic subjects (p less than 0.01) and non-asthmatic controls (p less than 0.01). The slope of this regression line was significantly greater for subjects with asthma than for control subjects (p less than 0.01), suggesting a uniform increase in PMN activity in cells obtained from asthmatic airways.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Bronchial epithelium in humans recently recovering from respiratory infections caused by influenza or mycoplasma.Sixty three bronchial mucosal biopsies were collected from 12 patients recovering from respiratory infections with influenza virus (n = 8) and Mycoplasma (n = 4). The bronchoscopy was performed within 1-6 wks from the onset of symptoms. Of the 63 biopsies prepared for light microscopy, 27 biopsies from the influenza patients and 10 from the Mycoplasia patients were further analysed at the light and electron microscope level. The epithelium and the underlying stroma was analysed morphometrically and the results were compared to those of 39 biopsies from 27 healthy subjects. A slightly raised bronchial reactivity was noted in two patients. In the influenza patients the epithelial height was greater compared to that of the healthy subjects and subepithelial lymphocytosis was noted. Areas with damaged epithelium, epithelium shedding, and occasionally a thickened basement membrane, considered typical for asthma, occurred in both infected groups, and in the biopsies of the healthy subjects.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Peak inspiratory flow and inspiratory vital capacity of patients with asthma measured with and without a new dry-powder inhaler device (Turbuhaler).In 101 asthmatic adults with varying degrees of bronchial obstruction, lung function tests including peak inspiratory flow (PIF), inspiratory vital capacity (IVC), peak expiratory flow (PEF), forced vital capacity (FVC), and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) measurements were made. Significant correlations between inspiratory and expiratory volumes were found. In most patients, PIF was less reduced than the expiratory parameters of pulmonary function. When inhalation was performed through the new multi-dose, dry-powder inhalation device, Turbuhaler (PIF-TBH), it was significantly lower than PIF measured without Turbuhaler. In previous studies, PIF-TBH of 30 l.min-1 or more has proven sufficient to produce a therapeutic dose of terbutaline, and to produce significant bronchodilatation. Of 101 asthmatics in the present study, only four had PIF-TBH of less than 30 l.min-1. Although no parameters of spirometry could accurately predict PIF-TBH, there was a tendency for patients with severely impaired ventilatory capacity to produce lower PIF-TBH than patients with normal or near-normal ventilatory capacity. If patients with severely impaired ventilatory capacity are to receive inhalation therapy through Turbuhaler, either PIF or PIF-TBH should be measured, or the effect should be carefully monitored.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Use of stethoscope by mothers of asthmatic children ages 1-5].The mothers of 24 asthmatic children aged 1-5 years, who visited a department of family medicine at the time of the attacks, were assigned alternately to 2 groups. The experimental study group got guidance and instruction in the use of the stethoscope, and also participated in a self-management educational program led by the family physician. The control group only got guidance and participated in the latter program. The purpose of the study was to determine whether mothers could assume more responsibility in decision-making with regard to their children's asthmatic attacks after basic technical guidance in the use of the stethoscope and in the interpretation of auscultatory findings. The results show that the initial steps in self-management were adequate in the 2 groups. These included recognition of the first signs of asthma in the child, a relaxed attitude (not to panic), the dispensing of suitable amounts of fluid, and the administration of bronchodilator medication without waiting for the physician's examination. Instructions to continue bronchodilator drugs, both oral and by inhaler, were more detailed in the experimental group. During the year of follow-up there were fewer visits to the clinic and the emergency room and no hospital admissions by those in the experimental group. The main conclusion of this study is that in conjunction with a self-management program, it is possible to teach mothers to use a stethoscope, to correctly interpret the auscultatory findings and accordingly, to give adequate treatment. This reduces clinic and emergency room visits and hospital admissions, relieves anxiety, and increases confidence in coping with this illness.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Relationship between the airway response to inhaled sulfur dioxide, isocapnic hyperventilation, and histamine in asthmatic subjects.To determine whether bronchoconstriction induced by sulfur dioxide can be predicted by the airway response to inhaled histamine, we exposed on two days 46 patients with asthma to air or 0.5 ppm SO2. The exposure protocol consisted of 10 min of tidal breathing followed by 10 min of isocapnic hyperventilation at a rate of 30 l/min. Airway response was measured before (baseline) and after hyperventilation in terms of specific airway resistance, SRaw. Exposure to air increased baseline mean (SD) SRaw from 6.27 (2.12) to mean (SD) maximum post-hyperventilation SRaw of 9.10 (4.38) cmH2O*s (P less than 0.0001). Exposure to SO2 increased mean (SD) baseline SRaw from 6.93 (3.29) to mean (SD) maximum post-hyperventilation SRaw of 18.21 (18.69) cmH2O*s (P less than 0.0001). Mean (SD) effect of SO2 defined as difference between maximum post-hyperventilation SRaw after SO2 versus air was 9.11 (16.14) cm H2O*s. When evaluated individually, 26 and 34 of the 46 patients showed an airway response to hyperventilation of air and SO2, respectively. Airway response to histamine was determined as the histamine concentration necessary to increase specific airway resistance by 100%, PC100SRaw. The airway response after SO2 and PC100SRaw showed a weak but significant correlation (R = -0.48), whereas the responses to hyperventilation and SO2 did not correlate. We suggest that the mechanisms by which histamine and SO2 exert their bronchomotor effects are different and that in asthmatic patients the risk of pollutant-induced asthmatic symptoms can be poorly predicted by histamine responsiveness.\n",

The study consisted of two groups; 20 patients on 800 micrograms and another 20 patients on 400 micrograms. In addition, 800 micrograms was administered to an additional 12 patients receiving 400 micrograms with insufficient effects. After two weeks of observation period, BD was administered for 12 weeks, and its effects adverse reactions were analyzed on the basis of asthma patients' diary etc. As the results, effects appeared earlier in the 800 micrograms group than in the 400 micrograms group and marked efficacy was seen. The 800 micrograms group was much better than the 400 micrograms group in the achievement of weaning from or of dose reduction of systemic steroid. A significant increase of serum cortisol levels which was considered to be due to the decrease of the systemic steroid usage was noted. Considerable efficacy was also observed in patients whose dosage had been increased from 400 micrograms to 800 micrograms. High dose administration usually increases topical side effects such as hoarseness and stomatitis, however the use of spacers was effective in the prophylaxis and treatment of those symptoms.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Effect of a spacer device used with metered dose inhaler].Metered dose inhaler (MDI) is widely used in treatment of bronchial asthma. But adequate efficacy is not obtained if the patients use an improper technique of inhalation. The spacer device was designed to reduce such inhalation errors. Three types of spacers (pear type, tube type, paper spacer) were studied to confirm their usefulness in bronchial asthma. Bronchodilating effect of procaterol (10 micrograms/puff X 2) in conventional MDI or MDI with a spacer was evaluated. There were no significant difference in the effect on the pulmonary function after single inhalation of MDI with or without a spacer for 60 minutes. In regular use of MDI with a spacer for two weeks, PEFR and FEV1.0 were slightly improved. These results suggest that effect of MDI with a spacer may be more effective than MDI alone in regular use.\n",

In spite of treatment, her asthmatic symptom did not improve. Therefore, she was admitted to our department on August 12 for a detailed examination and more effective therapy. Xanthine derivatives and beta 2 stimulant were ineffective, and only steroid hormone was effective to some degree. Pulmonary perfusion scan revealed that her pulmonary thromboembolism had become worse. Then she was treated with AT III concentrate and urokinase and her asthmatic symptom was significantly improved and steroid hormone could be easily reduced. Her asthmatic symptom was suggested to be due to progression of pulmonary thromboembolism.

Four asthma communication factors were identified by principal component analysis. We found that mothers whose preferred language was Spanish, and families who were not receiving public assistance, communicated more frequently about asthma in general. Spanish speaking mothers and their children communicated more about potential home treatments for asthma, and the more adults in the household the less there was communication about the need for emergency services for asthma. Mothers who preferred to speak Spanish had higher levels of management of the most recent asthma attack. Those whose children communicated with them about asthma in general were higher level managers. Children who influenced their parents' decisions about school attendance, and those whose mothers were more highly educated, had higher levels of asthma attack management. More educated mothers, ones whose children were younger at the time of the onset of asthma, and one who received public assistance, were more involved \"in general\" in their child's asthma care.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Consensus conference. The management of asthma in children].At this international consensus conference, a number of conclusions concerning the diagnosis and management of childhood asthma were reached. The following practical definition was given to asthma: intermittent wheezing and/or cough in a clinical situation where asthma is likely and less common diseases have been outruled. A thorough clinical history is essential to the diagnosis of asthma. Additional tests are used only to confirm the clinical impression and to provide objective evidence supporting therapeutic recommendations. Multidisciplinary management includes an evaluation of psychosocial factors and patient information. Drugs should be selected according to the severity of the condition: beta-2-agonists for intermittent mild wheezing; cromolyn sodium for moderate to severe asthma; xanthines, ipratropium bromide, and oral corticosteroids in more persistent and severe forms. The child and parents should be told that a normal, physically active life is quite possible if the disease is correctly controlled. The reward for correct management of asthma is resumption, in nearly every case, of a normal life including active participation in sports.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Actual usage of medical facilities by asthmatics in two French rural settings: a preliminary study.Until recently the medical management of asthmatic patients with respect to their socio-cultural environment had only been superficially studied. Four hundred and fifty eight adult asthmatics were identified through a two-stage questionnaire in two rural districts of south west France. The study has mainly demonstrated: 1) the large number of subjects experiencing more than one attack per week (33% in Gironde, 40% in Lot et Garonne); 2) the large number of subjects feeling disabled in their occupational and day-to-day life (52% in Gironde, 54% in Lot et Garonne); 3) the absence of a relationship between the severity of the disease and the use of medical facilities in the community. Despite the frequency of the attacks and the perceived disability, 27% of the patients felt that their asthma did not require any treatment and up to 60% did not seek medical help even during an attack; 4) the role of population density, type of dwelling and social status in the management of asthma. We conclude that under-treatment is widespread in these two rural settings and is closely related with the association of at least two of these three characteristics: 1) living in a low population density area; 2) living in an isolated dwelling; and 3) being a farm owner.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Clinical assessment after a life-threatening attack of asthma; the role of bronchial hyperreactivity.Between 1973 and 1986, 19 patients were treated on 21 occasions for life-threatening attacks of asthma. Twelve times mechanical ventilation was needed. None of the patients died. Most of the patients had been recognized as severely asthmatic before the life-threatening attack. Thirteen out of the 19 patients had previously been admitted with a severe asthmatic attack. All patients, except one, were already using maintenance treatment, and 17 had previously been referred to a pulmonologist. During follow-up the bronchial obstruction was, in most cases, fully reversible while using a rather extensive maintenance treatment (maximum forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), 69-138% of predicted). Recently, 17 of the 19 patients were reinvestigated, while in stable phase. The patients who had been mechanically ventilated were significantly more sensitive to inhaled histamine than the patients who had not been mechanically ventilated. This was not explained by any difference in basal FEV1 % pred or dosage of corticosteroids. A very low provocation concentration of histamine producing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20) may indicate the risk of a severe, life-threatening attack of asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Allergens and asthma.In many medical textbooks allergens are still listed as one of the \"trigger factors\" for asthma, with the implication that irritability of the lungs is an underlying physiologic property of the lungs. Over the last few years it has become clear that asthma is an inflammatory disease. In addition, it has been shown that changes in allergen exposure can lead to changes in bronchial reactivity. These results lead to the view that continued allergen exposure of the lungs of allergic individuals with resulting \"inflammation\" is an important primary cause of asthma. In parallel with this has come a progressive increase in awareness and understanding of the importance of house dust allergens. In many parts of the world, the dust mite dominates house dust allergy and appears to be responsible for up to 85% of asthma. In the United States three indoor allergens appear to play an equal role: dust mites, cats, and cockroaches. In the future, management of asthma will increasingly focus on allergen avoidance both as a method of treating symptomatic allergic patients and also as an approach to controlling the development of a disease which currently has increasing morbidity and mortality.\n",

Serum theophylline concentrations (SCT) were measured in 2-h intervals over 2 consecutive days for each theophylline formulation. A randomized, crossover design was used. In 12-h one dose of TT was absorbed 89.76 +/- 32.76% (means +/- SD) and TC 83.76 +/- 49.48%; between them there were statistically no differences. Amplitudes of SCT (AMP) were in the range 0.31 to 2.7 and mean 24-h SCT in the range 19.8 to 119.3 mumol/L. AMP were reproducible only to TT (r = 0.97, p less than 0.001). Fourier's harmonic analysis applied to mean SCT disclosed statistically significant 12-h oscillations only for TT (p less than 0.05). Continuous therapy with slow-release theophylline should always be monitored with measurements of SCT which should be interpreted by pharmacokinetics data of applied sustained theophylline formulation.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Calcium-regulating system in bronchial asthma].Calcium homeostasis was determined from ionized calcium (Ca2+), total calcium (Cat) and bound calcium (Cab) levels, content of calcium-regulating hormones: calcitonin (CT) and parathyroid hormone (PTH). Lipid peroxidation (LPO) intensity was assessed from the blood plasma hydroperoxide level in 71 patients with bronchial asthma and chronic asthmatic bronchitis. The findings evidence that high blood serum levels of Ca2+ and Cab and a tendency to reduction of PTH content are characteristic of nonsevere and medium-severity atopic asthma. In bacterial asthma Ca2+ level increases at the expense of Cab, that is parallelled by elevation of CT content, as the disease progresses in severity. Blood CT level gradually decreases until it disappears completely in Stage III bacterial asthma, whereas PTH level grows. CT/PTH ratio may be an indicator of disturbed equilibrium in the CT-PTH hormonal system. In the course of treatment Ca2+ binding, most manifest in bacterial asthma, increases, CT level grows and PTH one reduces. A tendency to normalization of hormonal levels resultant from therapy does not eventuate in their complete recovery; hormonal levels remain shifted, this pointing to the essential contribution of endocrine mechanisms to calcium homeostasis disorders in asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The epidemiology of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy in a biracial community.An epidemiologic study of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy was carried out in order to identify possible risk factors for this often fatal cause of heart failure in young adults. Possible associations with black race and other genetic and environmental factors were examined by comparing newly diagnosed cases ascertained from four Baltimore hospitals (n = 95) with neighborhood controls (n = 95), matched on sex and 5-year age intervals. Matched and unmatched relative odds and conditional logistic regression coefficients were obtained to describe the associations. Statistically significant, independent associations were observed between idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and black race, low annual income, and history of asthma (p less than 0.05). The black predominance (relative odds = 2.7, 95% confidence interval 2.0-3.4) was not explained by income, alcohol consumption, cigarette usage, body mass index, hypertension, or asthma. A possible interactive effect was observed between black race and history of asthma and other atopic diseases. Thus, blacks, especially those with a history of hypersensitivity, may represent a high-risk subgroup in need of preventive care or early intervention.\n",

Hospital admission rates for asthma increased in all paediatric age-groups with the most dramatic increase occurring in the youngest (zero- to four-years') age-group. This increase in hospital admissions for asthma has been accompanied by a rapid decline in admissions for other paediatric respiratory conditions that share a potential diagnostic overlap with asthma. Hospital admission rates for asthma have reached a plateau at the major paediatric teaching hospital in the State from 1977 and Statewide from 1983. Diagnostic transfer has contributed significantly to the reported increase in hospital admissions for asthma over the past two decades.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Mortality from chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and asthma in France, 1969-1983. Comparisons with the United States and Canada.This article focuses on international similarities and differences in levels and trends of mortality for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma in the US, Canada and France from 1969 to 1983. Comparisons have been made of national vital statistics data for age groups 55-64 years, 65-74 years and 75-84 years. From 1969 to 1978, under the 8th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), the COPD and asthma category included the codes 490-493 and, for the US and Canada, a special code 519.3. From 1979, under the 9th revision, COPD and asthma codes 490-493, 496 were in use in all three countries. The analyses of US, Canadian and French data show lower death rates for COPD and asthma in France. The ratio of male to female deaths from COPD increased with age in the US and Canada, but not in France. The proportion of COPD and asthma deaths attributed to bronchitis was higher in France. An increased use of code 496 (under 9th revision) was observed in the US and above all in Canada. In the three countries, death rates increased faster between 1979 and 1983 in women than in men and increases in women were steeper in the US and Canada than in France. Intercountry comparability is better for COPD mortality in the 9th revision than the 8th revision. Some differences observed between the three countries can be partly explained by coding practices and ICD revisions, but, allowing for differences in coding and classifying respiratory causes of death as well as ICD revisions, death rates are obviously higher in the US and Canada than in France. This suggests that the difference is real.\n",

Each patient had a positive skin test to Artemisia pollen extract and also a positive bronchial challenge response to the same extract. The patients were randomly assigned to active treatment or placebo group and received intensive oral administration of Artemisia pollen extract over a 50-day course. The nine patients who received the active treatment ingested a cumulative dose of 396,652 PNU and showed a significant decrease in serum-specific IgE antibodies (P less than .05) and a significant reduction in bronchial sensitivity to the same extract (P less than .01). The changes in these two variables correlated well (r = .8787, P less than .01). The nine patients who received the placebo showed no significant changes in serum-specific IgE or bronchial sensitivity to Artemisia pollen extract.

A prospective, double-blinded study was designed to evaluate how frequency of dosing of an inhaled beta-agonist, metaproterenol (Alupent inhalation solution) would affect patient response, length of stay in the ED, and admission rates. Forty-one patients initially received a 0.3-mL dose of nebulized metaproterenol followed by two additional doses of either metaproterenol or saline every 20 minutes. While there was no difference in response (forced expiratory volume in one second) in patients at 30 minutes after their arrival, there was an improved response in the metaproterenol group at 60 and 120 minutes. The length of stay in the ED was approximately the same for both groups. There was no significant difference in admission rates. No increase in undesirable side effects (eg, nausea, tremor, palpitations) was seen in the metaproterenol-treated group. Frequent dosing of metaproterenol is useful in asthmatics having acute exacerbations and leads to rapid improvement without an increase in toxicity.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Respiratory and skeletal muscle function in steroid-dependent bronchial asthma.Respiratory and skeletal (deltoid) muscle strength were evaluated in 34 oral steroid-dependent asthmatics by use of maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures and a myometer. The patients were compared to age- and sex-matched asthmatics who had never been on continuous oral steroid treatment. Endurance time was also studied in ten steroid-dependent asthmatics and ten controls using a pressure threshold breathing device. Nutritional status was assessed from body weight, midarm circumference, triceps skinfold (TSF), prealbumin, albumin, and total protein. An open biopsy from deltoid muscle was taken from nine steroid-dependent asthmatics and the diameter of type 1 and type 2 fibers was measured by a morphometric study. No differences were found between study and control groups either in respiratory and skeletal muscle strength or in endurance time. Steroid-dependent asthmatics showed a decrease in TSF, total protein, albumin, and potassium serum levels when compared with the control group but differences were not statistically significant after Bonferroni's adjustment for multiple comparison studies. Transversal diameter of type 2 fibers was significantly correlated with the percentage of ideal weight (r = 0.75 p less than 0.05), but not with average daily dose of steroids nor with the length of steroid treatment. Our results support the clinical impression that steroids, at the doses usually administered in chronic severe asthma, do not cause muscular weakness. We also found that malnutrition rather than corticosteroids is the most important contributory factor to type 2 muscle fiber atrophy in steroid-dependent asthma.\n",

The effects of a specific PAF acether antagonist (BN 52063) on the response to isocapnic hyperventilation with dry cold air (ISH study) and exercise (EIA study) were assessed in a single dose and short term treatment study in 10 patients with exercise induced asthma. 2. ISH challenge was performed twice within 1 h after administration of either placebo, 240 mg BN 52063 p.o. or inhalation of 2.4 mg BN 52063. Hyperventilation increased Raw from 0.30 +/- 0.02 to 0.89 kPa s l-1 (P less than 0.001) after the first challenge and from 0.28 +/- 0.04 to 0.84 +/- 0.06 kPa s l-1 (P less than 0.001) after the second challenge. Oral pretreatment with BN 52063 did not result in a reduction of bronchoconstriction during both challenges. A significant increase of Raw was noted immediately after inhalation of BN 52063. An inhibition of PAF induced platelet aggregation (by a factor of 2) occurred after oral administration of BN 52063 after both ISH challenges (P less than 0.05). No significant inhibition of PAF induced platelet aggregation was seen after inhalation of BN 52063. At concentrations up to 30 microM in vitro, BN 52063 inhibited PAF induced platelet aggregation in a dose dependent manner. The IC50 of BN 52063 against the aggregating effect of 1 microM PAF was 7.0 +/- 2.1 microM. 3. In the EIA study the patients were challenged on the third day of treatment with either placebo or 240 mg BN 52063 p.o. or 5 mg BN 52063 by inhalation.

      "ABSTRACT Decreased paradoxic pulse from increased venous return in severe asthma.During severe asthma, paradoxic pulse may result from increased impedance to left ventricular ejection, mechanical impairment of left ventricular filling by ventricular interdependence or decreased pulmonary venous return augmented by hypovolemia. We studied the effect of reversible blood volume expansion by MAST inflation during severe attacks of asthma. Ten patients with clinically detectable paradoxic pulse of more than 20 mm Hg were studied. All had a history of reversible bronchial asthma with evidence of respiratory and circulatory failure. Standard therapy for asthma was started. We observed no difference in respiratory and heart rates during MAST inflation. Paradoxic pulse was consistently decreased during MAST inflation; paradoxic pulse returned to baseline values after MAST deflation. The decrease in paradoxic pulse was produced by an increased inspiratory systolic arterial pressure. We conclude that a reduction in pulmonary venous return is more important than ventricular interdependence in producing paradoxic pulse during severe asthma.\n",

To confirm this observation, 177 bow-makers, working in a village near Erlangen (Bavaria), the centre of this manufacture, filled in questionnaires. Of these 36 worked with Fernambouc, 141 with other types of wood. Twelve out of these 36 suffered from dyspnoea, cough, sneezing impulses, tearing and coryza, which would disappear quickly at weekends and during holidays. 14 of those working with other types of wood merely had sneezing, irritation of the mucosa, a few also cough, dyspnoea and tearing. Extracts of Fernambouc splinters were made for serological testing. However, neither experimental sensitization in animals nor skin tests in the twelve gave allergic reactions. A 51-year-old woman with long-standing bronchial asthma developed dyspnoea five minutes after an inhalative provocation test; a prick test brought about slight infiltration. Thus, no evidence of an allergic origin of symptoms from Fernambouc dust inhalation could be elicited.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Asthma attack periodicity: a study of hospital emergency visits in Vancouver.Attendances at the emergency departments of the nine acute care hospitals serving the Vancouver region, with a population of just under a million people, were recorded from July 1, 1984 to October 31, 1986. Of about 25,500 visits a month, 2.7% were for respiratory conditions; and of these, 41.3% were for asthma. Data from 11 air monitoring stations were also tabulated on a daily basis, giving mean maximal hourly values for SO2, NO2, and O3; daily aerosol sulfate measurements from one station were also analyzed, together with daily temperature data and measurements of the coefficient of haze. In 3 consecutive years, a peak in asthma attendances was noted, starting in the last week of September, and continuing for 3 weeks. In these periods, weekly visits for asthma reached 130 patients; during the rest of the year, the weekly visits for asthma varied between 30 and 90. This peak affected children and adults between the ages of 15 and 60, but no increase was seen in those over 60 years. Although pollution levels increased sharply in the fall, a day-by-day analysis showed that the rise in asthma attendances preceded the increase in NO chi and SO2 levels for the region, expressed as the mean of the hourly maxima across all stations. It seems unlikely that a specific pollen is responsible for this, or that house mite replication is the cause. Soya beans are not shipped out of Vancouver. The cause of the peak has not been identified. Variations in emergency visits by day of the week have been recorded; in children and in those aged 15-60, more visits occur on Sundays than on other days, but this does not occur in those over 60. There is no significant variation in environmental data by day of the week. Intercorrelations between environmental variables and emergency visits have been calculated separately for the periods May 1 to October 31, and November 1 to April 31. SO2, NO2, and SO4 are strongly intercorrelated in both periods; ozone is strongly related to temperature, but less strongly correlated to sulfate than is the case in Southern Ontario. In summer, total emergency visits (but not respiratory visits) are strongly correlated with temperature in all age groups (the hotter the day, the more visits occur); but respiratory visits are not related to temperature, ozone, or NO2 levels. However, in the 15-60 age group, asthma and respiratory visits are correlated in summer with SO2 and SO4 levels (P = less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\n",

      "ABSTRACT Allergy in subjects with asthma from childhood to adulthood.We studied the change from childhood to adulthood in skin test reactivity to house dust, animal dander, grass pollen, and molds, and, in addition, the change in number of blood eosinophils. The study was carried out in a group of 119 children with asthma, aged 6 to 14 years first observed between 1966 and 1969. In the present study, 101 subjects (85%) were reinvestigated after a mean period of 16 years; 43% had current symptoms. Skin test reactivity to all allergens and the number of subjects with positive skin tests to more than one allergen increased from childhood to adulthood. Subjects with allergic rhinitis (38%) had a higher number of positive skin tests to grass pollen in both childhood and adulthood than subjects without allergic rhinitis. Fifty-three children and 10 adults had atopic dermatitis. Atopic dermatitis occurred with equal frequency in children who did and in children who did not have current symptoms later in life. No differences in skin test reactivity to allergens were found between smoking and nonsmoking subjects. Although the smoking period was relatively short, smoking was correlated with eosinophilia in adulthood. The mean number of eosinophils decreased significantly between the first and second survey. The outcome of childhood asthma as defined by current symptoms was not predicted by skin reactivity to allergens, eosinophilia, atopic dermatitis, or allergic rhinitis in childhood.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Exposure-response relationships in asthma caused by tetrachlorophthalic anhydride.Four patients with asthma caused by occupational exposure to tetrachlorophthalic anhydride (TCPA) had dust-challenge tests that used eight different levels of TCPA exposure. Measurements of TCPA in the test-cubicle air ranged from 1.3 to 961.1 micrograms/m3. The higher exposures provoked definite late or dual asthmatic responses. Smaller, but statistically significant, responses were observed at low exposures. The late asthmatic-response area had a linear relation to the logarithm of TCPA exposure, but the immediate asthmatic response was less closely related to exposure.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Long-term effects of aspirin desensitization--treatment for aspirin-sensitive rhinosinusitis-asthma.One hundred seven known aspirin (ASA)-sensitive patients with rhinosinusitis-asthma were studied from 1975 to 1988. Forty-two of the patients avoided ASA and served as the control group. Thirty-five patients were desensitized to ASA and treated with daily ASA treatment (Rx) for as long as 8 years (mean, 3.75 years) to May 1988 and were designated the continuous group. Thirty patients, initially desensitized to ASA and treated with daily ASA, who stopped Rx permanently after a mean duration of 2 years, were designated the discontinued group. Retrospective analyses of baselines revealed that both continuous and discontinued groups during ASA Rx demonstrated statistically significant reduction in number of hospitalizations per year, emergency room visits per year, outpatient visits per year, upper respiratory infections-sinusitis-antibiotics per year, need for nasal polypectomies and additional sinus operations, and improvement in sense of smell compared to the control group. Simultaneously, the ASA-Rx groups were able to significantly reduce systemic corticosteroid dosage, corticosteroid bursts per year, and, in the continuous group only, significantly reduce inhaled corticosteroids. All three groups maintained control of respiratory symptoms. ASA desensitization followed by long-term daily ASA Rx appears to improve ASA-sensitive rhinosinusitis-asthma and concomitantly allows reduction of systemic corticosteroids.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Asthma and heterozygous alpha 1-antichymotrypsin deficiency: a possible association.During studies of families with alpha 1-antichymotrypsin deficiency heterozygotes, an apparently increased prevalence of asthma among first degree relatives was noticed. In a case control study, the prevalence of asthma among first degree relatives of 12 women with heterozygous alpha 1-antichymotrypsin deficiency was compared with that of first degree relatives of 58 matched controls. Secondly, the strength of association between asthma and low or subnormal plasma ACT concentration, in first and second degree relatives to heterozygotes, was assessed. The prevalence of asthma among first degree relatives of women with heterozygous alpha 1-antichymotrypsin deficiency was significantly higher [prevalence ratio 3.22 (1.06-9.83), P = 0.04]. Among heterozygotes, the prevalence of asthma in first and second degree relatives with low plasma alpha 1-antichymotrypsin concentration was higher than in relatives with normal plasma ACT concentration, but the difference in prevalence did not reach statistical significance [prevalence ratio 3.1 (0.96-9.83), P = 0.059]. The findings are in agreement with previous studies and suggest a possible association between asthma and heterozygous alpha 1-antichymotrypsin deficiency.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Diagnostic value of body plethysmographic parameters in healthy and asthmatic young children is not influenced by breathing frequency.In 16 healthy and 16 asymptomatic asthmatic children (age range 5-8 yr; 8 girls, 24 boys) we studied the influence of breathing frequency on the results and the diagnostic value of body plethysmographic measurements. Airway resistance (Raw), specific airway resistance (SRaw), and thoracic gas volume (TGV) were measured during breathing (or breathing efforts against a closed shutter) at 0.4, 1, and 2 Hz. SRaw was computed by a simplified procedure directly from flow at the mouth vs. box volume-curves. The diagnostic value of each parameter was assessed as the percentage of correctly classified healthy and asthmatic subjects by means of discriminant analysis. When frequency was increased from 0.4 to 1 and 2 Hz mean TGV rose by 5 and 14% in healthy children and by 11 and 21% in asthmatic children, respectively. From 0.4 to 1 Hz mean Raw decreased by 16% (P = 0.002) in healthy children and by 25% (P = 0.0004) in asthmatic children. The differences in Raw between both groups decreased with frequency (3.5, 1.8, and 1.5 cm H2O.L-1.s at 0.4, 1, and 2 Hz, respectively) and those of TGV increased (0.13, 0.21, and 0.23 L). SRaw showed similar frequency characteristics as Raw. As intra-group variability changed in parallel with the differences the diagnostic value of the parameters remained constant with frequency. Simplified SRaw alone and TGV combined with Raw exhibited no differences in their diagnostic values (81-84% correctly classified).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "ABSTRACT Effect of inhaled triamcinolone on bronchial hyperreactivity and airways obstruction in asthma.We measured changes in methacholine bronchial hyperreactivity and airways obstruction in 37 asthmatics treated with inhaled triamcinolone for 6 weeks. All received regular bronchodilator therapy but not steroids or cromolyn. Initial studies included spirometry and the provocative concentration of methacholine required to decrease the FEV1 by 20% (PC20). Patients were randomized into two groups: those given inhaled triamcinolone, 200 micrograms four times daily (T) by metered dose inhaler, and those given a placebo inhaler (P). Daily AM and PM peak flow measurements were recorded, while PC20 and pulmonary function tests were obtained at 3 and 6 weeks. Change in canister weight was used to determine treatment compliance. The PC20 of T increased from a baseline 1.00 mg/mL to 2.90 mg/mL at 6 weeks, whereas in P it decreased from 1.15 mg/mL to 1.05 mg/mL. Percent change in PC20 (delta PC20) for each patient was defined as: [(PC20(week 6)--PC20(baseline]/PC20 (baseline)] X 100. At 6 weeks, this was 290% in T versus 65% in P (P less than .05). Likewise, at 6 weeks T was significantly greater than P with respect to: delta FEV1 (4.1% versus -3.8%, P less than .05) and delta FEF25-75% (20.3% versus -5.6%, P less than .01). Patients were further separated into higher and lower complier subgroups. In T, higher compliers showed more improvement at 6 weeks than lower compliers in: delta PC20 (533.3 versus 67.8%, P less than .05), delta FEV1 (8.7 versus -1.7%, P less than .01), and delta FEF25-75% (31.9 versus 1.1%, P less than .01).

      "ABSTRACT Safety of frequent high dose nebulized terbutaline in children with acute severe asthma.Forty-four Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) admissions for acute severe asthma in 27 children between 8/80 and 10/86 were reviewed to determine the safety of prolonged administration of frequently nebulized terbutaline. The mean dose of nebulized terbutaline was 0.2 mg/kg/dose (range = 0.1 to 0.4 mg/kg/dose) given at a mean frequency of 2.4 +/- 1.2 hours. Seven patients received continuous nebulization at a dose of 0.4 +/- 0.2 mg/kg/h. All patients were placed on continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring. Emergency room therapy was determined by the primary emergency room physicians. Upon admission to the PICU, the mean +/- SD heart rate was 150 +/- 21 bpm and the respiratory rate was 44 +/- 16 bpm. After institution of therapy, these parameters decreased to a similar degree in parallel. The maximum decrease after 36 hours was 28% and 37% for heart rate and respiratory rate, respectively. No cardiac arrhythmias were noted. The initial PaCO2 upon admission to the PICU was 32 mm Hg (range = 24 to 44 mm Hg), the maximum decrease in PaCO2 generally occurred during the 6-hour to 12-hour time interval following admission. We conclude that frequent administration of high doses of nebulized terbutaline is safe in the management of acute severe childhood asthma even in the setting of prolonged administration to the hospitalized child.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Dose-response effects of two sizes of monodisperse isoproterenol in mild asthma.The dose-response effect of monodispersed isoproterenol of two different sizes (diameters 2.5 and 5 microns) was examined in eight mild asthmatic subjects (baseline FEV, 81.5% of predicted). Pulmonary and cardiovascular variables were measured before and following 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 cumulative min of aerosol inhalation. Subjects inhaled 1 to 30 micrograms (2.5-microns particles) or 2 to 50 micrograms (5-microns particles) of isoproterenol. Pulmonary but not cardiac responses were significantly greater for the 2.5-microns particles as compared to equivalent doses of 5-microns particles. Pulmonary dose-related response differences were particularly marked for variables associated with small airway function (FEF25-75 and FEF75-85). These findings suggest that small particles penetrate more deeply into the lung and thereby more effectively dilate small airways and that small amounts of appropriately sized inhaled bronchodilator may produce considerable therapeutic effects.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Prior exposure to ozone potentiates subsequent response to sulfur dioxide in adolescent asthmatic subjects.The objective of this study was to test whether prior exposure to a low concentration of ozone (120 ppb) would condition airways in asthmatic subjects to respond to a subthreshold concentration of sulfur dioxide (100 ppb). Eight male and five female subjects 12 to 18 yr of age participated. They all had allergic asthma and exercise-induced bronchospasm. Subjects were exposed to three test atmosphere sequences during intermittent moderate exercise (a 45-min exposure to one pollutant followed by a 15-min exposure to the second pollutant). The sequences were: air followed by 100 ppb SO2, 120 ppb O3 followed by 120 ppb O3, and 120 ppb O3 followed by 100 ppb SO2. The pulmonary function measurements assessed were FEV1, total respiratory resistance (RT), and maximal flow (Vmax50). Air-SO2 and O3-O3 exposures did not cause significant changes in pulmonary function. On the other hand, exposure to 100 ppb SO2 after a 45-min exposure to 120 ppb O3 caused a significant (8%) decrease in FEV1 (p = 0.046), a significant (19%) increase in RT (p = 0.048), and a significant (15%) decrease in Vmax50 (p = 0.008). It is concluded that prior O3 exposure increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness in these subjects such that they responded to an ordinarily subthreshold concentration of SO2. These data suggest that assessment of pulmonary changes to single pollutant challenges overlooks the interactive effects of common coexisting or sequentially occurring air pollutants.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Short-term exposure to 0.3 ppm nitrogen dioxide does not potentiate airway responsiveness to sulfur dioxide in asthmatic subjects.Whether short-term exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) enhances airway responsiveness in asthmatic subjects is controversial. Because it is well established that asthma is associated with increased airway responsiveness to another common air pollutant, sulfur dioxide (SO2), we examined whether short-term exposure of asthmatic subjects to 0.3 ppm NO2 potentiates airway responsiveness to inhaled SO2. We exposed nine subjects with clinically stable asthma to 0.3 ppm NO2 or filtered air in an environmental room for 30 min on 2 separate days at least 1 wk apart in a double-blind, randomized fashion. A questionnaire about common symptoms related to inhaled irritants was completed before and immediately after each exposure. Each subject exercised (60 to 80 W) on a cycloergometer during the first 20 min of each exposure. We measured specific airway resistance (SRaw) and FEV1/FVC before, 5 min after, and 1 h after completion of the air or NO2 exposure. The single-breath nitrogen test (SBN2) was also performed before and 1 h after completion of the air or NO2 exposures and closing volume was determined; subsequently, SO2 dose-response curves (0.25 to 4.0 ppm) were performed via a mouthpiece. Each dose of SO2 was inhaled at a minute ventilation of 20 L/min for 4 min and was doubled until SRaw increased by at least 8 U above baseline. The dose of SO2 required to provoke an increase in SRaw of 8 U above baseline was determined by linear interpolation from the dose-response curve (PD8Uso2).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "ABSTRACT Acute topical steroid administration blocks mast cell increase and the late asthmatic response of the canine peripheral airways.Previous studies indicated that mast cell number increased after airway exposure to Ascaris suum antigen (Ag). The following two series of experiments were performed to test the hypothesis that this phenomenon may be associated with the Ag-induced late-phase bronchoconstriction (LAR). In the first, two bronchoscopes wedged in airway segments of two contralateral lobes of 16 dogs were used to deliver 0.26, 2.6, or 26 micrograms of Ag to one lobe; the other served as a control. After the observation of a LAR, Ag and control lobes plus one unexposed tissue sample were collected and prepared for histologic examination. The data showed that the incidence, time of onset, and magnitude of the LAR were dose-related. In the second series of experiments, performed in 14 dogs, the tracheal mucosal surface was surgically exposed to allow 80 micrograms of beclomethasone dipropionate to be sprayed on one half while the other half was left untreated. Pledgets saturated with 0.2 microgram of Ag were placed on both sides 1 h later. Then two bronchoscopes were used to pretreat airways of two contralateral lobes to 40 micrograms of either the steroid or the vehicle. One hour later, both airways were exposed to 2.6 micrograms of aerosolized Ag. Of these 14 dogs monitored for peripheral airway responses, seven demonstrated a LAR in the vehicle-treated airway. In all seven dogs, the LAR was absent in the steroid-treated airway even though the cellular profiles of the two airways did not significantly differ. In seven additional dogs, the bronchoscopic procedure was performed as previously described. However, these dogs were killed 1 h after Ag exposure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

His hospital course was complicated by refractory hypotension and severe ischemic necrosis of skeletal muscle, bowel, and liver. The metabolic abnormalities observed early in his hospital course included severe hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypermagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and profound metabolic acidosis. These metabolic abnormalities differ from those previously reported in cases of massive theophylline overdose. The metabolic abnormalities observed in this patient probably reflected his extensive ischemic tissue damage with release of intracellular ions and associated acidemia.

      "ABSTRACT Strain differences in guinea pigs' bronchial sensitivity to acetylcholine.The bronchial sensitivity to acetylcholine (ACh) of guinea pigs of various strains was investigated to clarify strain differences. Inbred Strain 2, Strain 13 and JY-1 and non-inbred Hartley strain (two colonies) were used in this experiment. (1) Guinea pigs were exposed to 0.08% ACh aerosol and the time needed to produce falling down (TNPFD) was determined. Mean +/- standard error of TNPFD (n = 14 per group) of animals was 182 +/- 28 sec, 148 +/- 22 sec, 210 +/- 30 sec, 342 +/- 24 sec and 406 +/- 36 sec in Strain 2, Strain 13, JY-1, Hartley (Japan SLC) and Hartley (Hitachi), respectively. There was a significant difference in TNPFD between inbred strains and non-inbred strains (P less than 0.05 or P less than 0.01), indicating that inbred strains had higher sensitivity. (2) Guinea pigs were exposed to 20-5000 micrograms/ml ACh for 2 min. The mean dose threshold as determined by transcutaneous oxygen pressure was 524 micrograms/ml, 424 micrograms/ml, 614 micrograms/ml, 1317 micrograms/ml and 1651 micrograms/ml (n = 14 per group) in Strain 2, Strain 13, JY-1, Hartley (Japan SLC) and Hartley (Hitachi), respectively. Inbred strains showed lower dose thresholds than non-inbred strains. (3) Isolated trachea-lungs of 5 guinea pigs were perfused with 10(-9)-10(-5) g/ml ACh to determine strain differences. Dose response curves of animals of inbred strains shifted to the left (lower concentrations), unlike those of non-inbred strains, suggesting that inbred strains had higher sensitivity to ACh than non-inbred strains.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

OKY-046.HCl (100 mg/kg, intraduodenally) inhibited the AHR, which was accompanied by its inhibition of the TXB2 generation. However, no changes of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha in BALF were found. 2) There were no changes in the number of leukocytes; the activities of alkaline phosphatase, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, and lactate dehydrogenase; and the LTC4/D4/E4 in BALF. 3) In bronchus-lung preparations, PAF (1 microgram/min) also caused the AHR and increased TXB2 generation. OKY-046.HCl (100 micrograms/min) inhibited the AHR and TXB2 generation. 4) PAF (1 microgram/ml) evoked TXB2 generation in BALF from normal guinea pigs. OKY-046.HCl (10(-4)M) inhibited its increase. 5) Stable TXA2 (STA2, 1 ng/ml) inhalation also caused AHR to ACh at 30 min. STA2 (0.45 ng/min) also caused the AHR in bronchus-lung preparations. These results suggest that OKY-046.HCl can inhibit PAF-induced AHR by suppressing the generation of TXA2. We also supposed that TXA2 is released from lung parenchyma, airway epithelium and cell components in BALF.\n",

The present article describes the distribution of IgE levels in 2657 subjects in a general population sample in Tucson, Ariz. Limits of IgE defining the lower 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, and 95% in 1569 subjects with negative allergy skin tests and without current asthma, considered a reference group, are provided by age and sex. These cutoffs are then used to compare groups with asthma and with positive allergy skin tests with the reference population. Distributions of IgE levels in these groups are vastly different, but defining an upper \"limit of normal\" for serum IgE is of doubtful clinical value because there is no single level of IgE that distinguishes different groups with any precision. The spread of IgE values is extremely wide in subjects with and without known allergic diseases.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Continuous nebulization of albuterol (salbutamol) in acute asthma.We studied the safety and efficacy of albuterol (salbutamol) delivered by continuous nebulization (CN) in the initial emergency department treatment of asthma. In a randomized fashion 21 patients received 5 mg of albuterol by bolus nebulization (BN) at time 0 and again 60 minutes later. Twenty-one others received albuterol (0.2 mg/ml) by CN using a calibrated nebulizer with a known output of 25 ml/h. Thus, each patient had received 10 mg of albuterol over two hours. FEV1, blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and hand tremor were recorded at 30-minute intervals. The FEV1 was 1.48 +/- 0.64 L prior to BN and increased to a maximum of 2.20 +/- 0.94 L (p less than 0.05) 90 minutes later. The FEV1 prior to CN was 1.13 +/- 0.51 L and improved to 2.20 +/- 1.02 L (p less than 0.05) at 120 minutes. The FEV1 did not differ significantly between regimens over the 2-hour period. Both modes of therapy were well tolerated. There was a slight but significant increase in HR at 30 and 90 minutes in the BN group when compared with CN. There was no significant difference in BP, RR, or tremor between the groups. Thus, albuterol by CN was found to be equally effective as the same medication by BN in the early treatment of asthma in patients seen in the emergency department.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Effect of verapamil inhalation on bronchial asthma.The effect of inhaled verapamil 20 mg on pulmonary functions and arterial blood gases in 15 patients with extrinsic bronchial asthma was studied in single-blind fashion. A significant decrease (p less than 0.05) in airway resistance and a significant increase (p less than 0.01) in specific conductance was observed after verapamil inhalation. A small increase (p less than 0.1) was observed in forced vital capacity and peak expiratory flow rate after verapamil inhalation; however, this was not statistically significant. None of the parameters of pulmonary function tests showed a significant change after normal saline inhalation. A significant fall in PaO2 (p less than 0.05) and PaCO2 (p less than 0.05) was noted after normal saline inhalation. PaCO2 showed a significant fall (p less than 0.01) after verapamil inhalation. Alveolar arterial oxygen gradient P(A-a)O2 widened significantly (p less than 0.001) after normal saline inhalation. A larger dose (20 mg) of verapamil inhalation produces a significant bronchodilator effect on large airways, but does not produce a significant change in arterial oxygen tension from the baseline value in patients with bronchial asthma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Evaluation of a capsulated hydrophilic carrier polymer (the ImmunoCAP) for measurement of specific IgE antibodies.The Pharmacia CAP System is a new assay for serum specific IgE, utilising a solid phase capable of binding more antigen than conventional systems. The CAP System has been evaluated in 69 consecutive patients referred to one allergy clinic in relation to skin prick test (SPT), radioallergosorbent test (Phadebas RAST) and specific allergy diagnosis for five inhalant allergens, D.pteronyssinus, timothy grass pollen, cat epithelium/dander, Cladosporium and Alternaria. Good correlation was obtained between RAST and CAP for all allergens, e.g. r = 0.974 for D.pteronyssinus and r = 0.964 for grass pollen. When sensitivity and specificity were examined for both CAP and RAST versus SPT, CAP was usually found to be of greater sensitivity than RAST, and of similar or slightly lower specificity. SPT gave more positive reactions than either in vitro test, but CAP gave more positives than RAST. Twenty-two of 336 (6.6%) tests were CAP positive/RAST negative, whereas a negative CAP with a positive RAST occurred in only 2/336 (0.6%) tests. Of patients with any test (SPT or RAST or CAP) for specific IgE positive, up to 20-30% did not have clinical allergy, confirming the importance of the history in interpreting these tests. Our results suggest that, for the allergens tested, the Pharmacia CAP System is more sensitive than the RAST, identifying more positive tests and approximating more closely to the SPT. It offers the additional advantages of speed and efficiency.\n",

Using standard organ bath techniques, the in vitro isometric contractile and relaxant responses of tracheal strips obtained from seven asthmatics (A) (mean age, 48 +/- 6 SEM yr) dying during severe asthma attacks outside hospital were studied 7.6 +/- 1.3 h after death. Drug therapy had varied, but it had always included inhaled beta 2-agonists. Control data (C) were obtained from 31 subjects (54 +/- 2 yr) studied 9.5 +/- 0.4 h after sudden nonrespiratory death. Cholinergic contractile and nonadrenergic noncholinergic inhibitory (NANCI) neural responses were studied with electrical field stimulation (EFS); histamine, isoproterenol (ISO), and theophylline (THEO) responses were studied using cumulative techniques.

      "ABSTRACT Pulmonary gas exchange in severe chronic asthma. Response to 100% oxygen and salbutamol.Ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) inequality has been evaluated using the multiple inert gas technique in nine nonsmoking patients (mean +/- SD, age 56 +/- 10 yr) with stable, severe, chronic asthma (partially reversible airway obstruction; baseline FEV1, 39 +/- 10% predicted) before and during 100% O2 breathing and then 15 min after three puffs (300 micrograms) of inhaled salbutamol. The aim of this study was to investigate whether this type of asthma was associated with a different pattern of VA/Q inequality from that observed in acute episodes and in particular to determine whether the VA/Q pattern was fixed or could be altered by bronchodilator agents or O2 breathing. The predominant pattern of VA/Q distribution was broad and unimodal but without shunt (VA/Q = 0) or low VA/Q areas (VA/Q less than 0.1 to greater than 0.005). The amount of VA/Q inequality as assessed by the dispersion of the distribution of pulmonary bloodflow (log SDQ) was not great (log SDQ, 0.77 +/- 0.09), and no correlation was found with the degree of airway obstruction, PaO2 or AaPO2. During 100% O2 breathing, VA/Q inequality worsened (from log SDQ of 0.77 +/- 0.09 to 1.11 +/- 0.21, p = 0.01) with an increase in the perfusion of low VA/Q units (from 0.43 +/- 0.66% to 6.3 +/- 6.5%, p = 0.02) but still no development of shunt. This suggests the presence of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction breathing air, possibly contributing to the preservation of VA/Q relationships.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

All of them filled out a questionnaire concerning allergic symptoms. Among them, 412 (8.1%) children showed a positive reaction to at least one of the two mite allergens, the range varying between 5.6 and 11.2% according to the child's age. Boys had higher prevalence of positive mite specific IgE than girls (9.8% vs. 6.4%, P less than 0.01), with the overall male to female ratio 1.5:1. The prevalence of bronchial asthma in boys and girls was 5.3% and 3.3% respectively. The positive mite specific IgE antibody in children with asthma and allergic rhinitis was 52% (103 of 198) and 28.7% (193 of 673) respectively. The mean levels of mite specific IgE were not significantly related to the age of onset and severity of asthmatic symptoms (P greater than 0.1), but were significantly different among subjects with current and past asthma (P less than 0.001). It is suggested that the mite-specific IgE may play a role in the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma in children.\n",

We also studied D. farinae-, egg-white-, and milk-specific IgE of children with allergic diseases. D. farinae-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG4 and IgA in Groups 2 and 3 increased until 5 years of age and thereafter they remained constant. After 2 years of age, D. farinae-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG4 and IgA in Group 2 were higher than those in Groups 1 and 3.

These two extracts were skin-tested on 170 respiratory allergy patients and 52 (30.6%) of them elicited a markedly positive cutaneous reaction (2+ to 4+) to any one or both the WBEs. Of these 52 patients, 32 (61.5%) produced a 2+ to 4+ response to only one, and the remaining 20 (38.5%) to both the extracts. In female and male RASTs to Pa both the extracts produced dose-related inhibition. Using rabbit anti-Pa female serum: (1) immuno-diffusion experiments resulted in lines of identity with the two extracts, and (2) the two-dimensional immunoelectrophoresis of Pa female and Pa male WBEs elicited 12 and nine precipitin peaks, respectively. In partial purification studies, only fraction Pa(F)III (approximately 50 kD) of Pa female WBE and Pa(M)I (greater than or equal to 600 kD) and Pa(M)III (approximately 50 kD) fractions of Pa male WBE revealed significant allergen activity both on skin testing and also in RAST inhibition studies.

Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and pulse rate were measured 15, 30, 45 and 60 min after inhalation from the inhaler and then hourly up to 8 h. The results showed that a more rapid onset of action, a greater maximal response and a longer duration of action can be achieved by exceeding the standard dose of terbutaline of 0.5 mg. The incidence of adverse effects was very low even at the highest dose, 4 mg. This study emphasizes the need for individual dosing of inhaled bronchodilators.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Comparison between theophylline and an adenosine non-blocking xanthine in acute asthma.Enprofylline, a drug without adenosine antagonism and theophylline, a potent adenosine antagonist, were compared, double-blind, randomized, in acute asthma (n = 33). The drugs were given intravenously as loading over 10 min followed by maintenance infusion for 24 h. Mean final plasma levels were very high with enprofylline (14 mg.l), and larger than calculated with theophylline (16 mg.l). Seven patients had maximum levels of enprofylline ranging between 16 and 42 mg.l. Extreme plasma levels of enprofylline were not associated with any theophylline-like central nervous system excitatory effects related to seizure-inducing ability. Some irregularities in the heart rhythm did not raise clinical problems and no significant difference between enprofylline and theophylline was recorded. At 1 h patients on enprofylline (mean plasma level: 5.7 mg.l) and theophylline (12.2 mg.l) had improved their peak expiratory flow rates by 31% and 15% (p less than 0.05), respectively. The improvement in lung function after 24 hours did not differ between treatments suggesting that the high levels of enprofylline were supramaximal for its anti-asthma effects in this situation. In conclusion, with enprofylline it is demonstrated that an adenosine non-blocking xanthine derivative may lack CNS-excitatory effects, but be more potent than theophylline in the treatment of acute asthma.\n",

Both groups increased their knowledge of the disease and how to treat it, with slightly better results in the intervention group. The self-assessments all showed that patients in the intervention group felt better than those in the control group. The number of days in hospital as well as acute visits to out patients clinics were reduced significantly after the asthma school. The intervention did not influence spirometric variables.\n",

To determine the provocative ventilation necessary to increase specific airway resistance (sRaw) by 100% (PV100sRaw) ventilation was increased in steps of 15 l.min-1, each step lasting 3 min. Resting ventilation of filtered air, NO2, or SO2 was followed by a slight but significant overall decrease of sRaw from 8.8 to 7.7 cmH20.s-1, with no differences between the study days. Mean +/- SEM PV100sRaw(SO2) was 46.5 +/- 5.1, 37.7 +/- 3.5 and 45.4 +/- 4.2 l.min-1 after tidal breathing of filtered air, NO2, and SO2, respectively. PV100sRaw(SO2) was significantly lower after NO2 as compared to filtered air or SO2 (p less than 0.01). There was a significant correlation (rs = 0.86) between the individual shift of PV100sRaw(SO2) after NO2 and the shift after SO2 as compared to filtered air. From these individual comparisons we suggest that in asthmatics short-term exposure to NO2 at rest enhances airway responsiveness to hyperventilation of SO2 without altering airway tone, whereas short-term exposure with low concentrations of SO2 does not.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Effects of increasing doses of beta-agonists on airway and parenchymal hysteresis.We examined the effects of a deep inhalation on airway caliber before and after increasing doses of a beta-agonist in eight subjects, including one former and two current but mild asthmatics. With bronchodilation the increase in maximal flow on the partial flow-volume curve (P), initiated from functional residual capacity, exceeded that seen on the maximal curve (M), initiated from total lung capacity, such that isovolumic maximal flows diminished after a deep inhalation; i.e., M/P ratios fell with bronchodilation, as we and others have found. Five of eight reversed this downward trend in M/P ratios at higher cumulative doses. Quasistatic pressure-volume curves (QSPV) were simultaneously performed on two of these five and demonstrated a decrease in pressure-volume hysteresis (PVH) at the higher doses associated with a rising M/P ratio. Three of eight had continuing low and diminishing M/P ratio up to the highest dose given. QSPV were performed in two of these three and indicated no change in PVH at any of the doses. One of these two had a repeat study using a subcutaneous beta-agonist after the inhaled drug was given, and the M/P ratio rose as QSPV PVH fell. These data support the relative hysteresis analysis of airway and parenchyma as an explanation for volume history effects on airway caliber.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Atopy in subjects with asthma followed to the age of 28 years.The relationship between markers of asthma and atopy was examined in 323 subjects at the age of 28 years who have been followed since the age of 7 years. Hay fever was common in all groups with severe asthma, increasing from 25% of the control group to 67% of the group with the most severe asthma, class V. Eczema was uncommon at this age in all groups. IgE levels, peripheral blood eosinophil counts, and skin reactions were significantly (p less than 0.05) higher in class V than in the control group. Increasing age was associated with a progressive fall in eosinophil counts and an increase in skin reactivity to common allergens. No change in IgE levels was observed from 21 to 28 years. A general relationship between bronchial hyperreactivity and atopic markers was found. However, only the occurrence of hay fever was significantly related to reactivity when account was taken of severity of asthma. The results indicate that the relationship between asthma and atopy observed at earlier reviews continues into adult life and that bronchial hyperreactivity and atopy are not directly linked.\n",

She had latex sensitivity by skin prick testing. This finding led to a survey of her workplace. Of the 81 workers, 84% completed a questionnaire to assess work-related respiratory symptoms, 79% underwent skin prick testing to latex and six other workplace chemicals, and 62% performed workshift spirometry. Seven workers had spirometric changes consistent with asthma, of whom five had greater than or equal to 15% fall in FEV1 during the workshift. Six of these workers underwent methacholine-challenge testing, and three were found to have a significant improvement in responsiveness to methacholine away from work, suggestive of occupational asthma. Two of these workers had positive skin test responses to latex. Including the index case, 6% of workers who had pulmonary function testing had findings of latex-related occupational asthma. Skin test responses to latex occurred in 11% of workers tested. Our findings suggest that latex should be considered among the causes of occupational asthma.\n",

Efficacy and side effects vs delayed-action theophylline anhydride].Two homogeneous groups of 8 patients suffering from bronchial asthma or chronic obstructive bronchial pneumonia were treated with slow release theophylline anhydride or bamiphylline respectively, both products being given orally twice a day. The results showed that both drugs possess a powerful bronchodilatory action and therefore have a beneficial effect on subjective symptoms. Statistical analysis confirmed the absence of any significant difference between the two xanthine derivatives, both of which were well-tolerated though bamiphylline offered a slight advantage in this respect. In fact there were no side effects at all in the bamiphylline group whereas there was one case of moderate gastric intolerance in the group given theophylline anhydride, though it was not severe enough to warrant suspension of the treatment or reduction of the dose.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Mononuclear cell activation in status asthmaticus].Evidence was provided by the authors, that the activity of circulating mononuclear cells is increased in status asthmaticus. An increased spontaneous secretion of chemotactic cytokin was found into the culture medium. There was no further increase in neutrophil chemotactic activity after 24 hours. In all patients a reduction was observed in the amount of neutrophil chemotactic activity after one week therapy, which is probably due to steroid treatment. No eosinophil chemotactic activity could be detected in the mononuclear cell supernatant derived from patients with acute severe asthma. The chemotactic activity was measured using a 48-well microchemotactic chamber. This mononuclear cell derived cytokin may play a role in genesis of asthmatic bronchial inflammation and provides further evidence that mononuclear cell activation is a feature of status asthmaticus.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Maternal smoking and childhood asthma.According to a substantial literature, passive smoking by children is associated with an increased incidence of lower respiratory illness and diminished pulmonary function. The relationship between passive smoking and childhood asthma, however, is not clear. Data from the Child Health Supplement to the 1981 National Health Interview Survey were analyzed with information about 4331 children aged 0 to 5 years to study the relationship between maternal smoking and (1) the prevalence of childhood asthma, (1) the likelihood of taking asthma medication, (3) the age of onset of children's asthma, and (4) the number of hospitalizations among children with and without asthma. An odds ratio for asthma of 2.1 was shown by multivariate logistic regressions among children whose mothers smoke 0.5 packs of cigarettes or more per day compared with children of nonsmokers (P = .001). In similar analyses maternal smoking of 0.5 packs per day was identified as an independent risk for children's use of asthma medications (odds ratio 4.6, P = .0006) and for asthma developing in the first year of life (odds ratio 2.6, P = .0006). Maternal smoking is also associated with increased numbers of hospitalizations by its association with an increased risk of asthma as well as by contributing to hospitalizations independently of a child having asthma. Among children with asthma, however, maternal smoking is not associated with increased numbers of hospitalizations. It was concluded that maternal smoking is associated with higher rates of asthma, an increased likelihood of using asthma medications, and an earlier onset of the disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "ABSTRACT Treatment of asthma. New and time-tested strategies.Early, aggressive therapy in conjunction with good communication with a knowledgeable, caring physician may reverse the trends of increasing morbidity and mortality from asthma. Allergen avoidance and immunotherapy are helpful in some patients. For those who need medication, bronchodilation with a beta 2-adrenergic drug, often in conjunction with an anticholinergic and theophylline, is the current treatment of choice for acute symptoms. For prophylaxis of chronic symptoms, sustained-release theophylline is still an excellent drug. However, an anti-inflammatory agent (eg, cromolyn sodium [Intal]) or, in some cases, an inhaled corticosteroid, may be an effective alternative. Whatever treatment is used, its success depends on effective self-management, which begins with education of the patient and family.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Changes in hospital management of acute severe asthma by thoracic and general physicians in Birmingham and Manchester during 1978 and 1985.Hospital management of acute severe asthma in 14 large hospitals in Birmingham and Manchester was audited in a random 20% of 1196 patients aged 15-45 years admitted in 1985. Of the 239 admissions randomised, 192 were suitable for study. Results were compared with those from a study in the same hospitals using the same methods in 1978. The age and sex of the patients and their smoking history, duration of asthma, and hospital attendance were similar in 1978 and 1985. A much smaller proportion of patients presented with symptoms of over seven days' duration in 1985 (8.5%) than in 1978 (26%). The inpatient management of asthma appears to have improved in both thoracic and general units, with more thorough functional assessments, more frequent performance of relevant investigations (arterial blood gases and peak expiratory flow rates) and more frequent use of recommended treatment (nebulised bronchodilators, oral and intravenous corticosteroids). Less difference was found in 1985 between units with a specialist thoracic interest and those without, though some differences remained in 1985 in monitoring of peak expiratory flow rate and arterial blood gases, outpatient prescribing, and follow up arrangements. Inhaled preventive medication was prescribed more frequently than in 1978. In 1985 there was a 56% increase in admissions for asthma. The proportion of severely ill patients was similar to that in 1978, but in the most severe functional grade mean arterial carbon dioxide tension was higher in 1985 and more patients were ventilated. Our results suggest that hospital management by thoracic and general physicians has improved over the period 1978-85. Patients presented earlier in 1985, though there seems to have been an increase in asthma of all grades of severity.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Reduced selenium in asthmatic subjects in New Zealand.Selenium is an essential component of glutathione peroxidase, an enzyme that helps protect cells against oxidation damage and modulates the lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism. Low selenium concentrations might therefore influence the inflammatory process in asthma by reducing the activity of glutathione peroxidase. Whole blood and plasma selenium concentrations and glutathione peroxidase activity have been measured in 56 asthmatic patients and 59 non-asthmatic control subjects in New Zealand, a country with a low dietary selenium intake and a high prevalence of asthma. When compared with control subjects the asthmatic patients had lower values for whole blood selenium concentrations (-4.9, 95% confidence interval -10.2 to 0.4 ng/ml) and glutathione peroxidase activity (-3.3, 95% CI -5.8 to -0.8 units/g Hb). There was a 1.9 and 5.8 fold increased risk of asthma in subjects with the lowest range of whole blood selenium concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity respectively (95% CI 0.6 to 5.6 and 1.6 to 21.2). Levels were lower in patients and control subjects without an atopic predisposition, but were not affected by prednisone use. Similar differences between the asthmatic and control subjects were not observed for selenium concentration or glutathione peroxidase activity measured in plasma, which reflects short term rather than long term selenium content. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that low selenium concentrations may have a role in the pathogenesis of asthma in New Zealand.\n",

Occurrence and prediction of side effects.A double-blind study on hyposensitization (HS) with two extracts prepared from the house dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Dp) was performed on a group of asthmatics with bronchial sensitivity to Dp. In 18 patients, aluminium-hydroxide was added to the Dp-extract to give a depot effect (Dp-group). Nineteen patients were treated with a similar extract in which allergenicity had been reduced by coupling to monomethoxypolyethylene glycol (mPEG-Dp-group). This extract had previously been shown to have less effect on clinical symptoms and skin sensitivity compared to the Dp-extract. In the Dp- and mPEG-Dp-groups, 778 and 675 injections were administered. Fifteen and 12 patients in the Dp- and mPEG-Dp-groups had systemic reactions (P greater than 0.05). The frequency of injections giving systemic reactions was reduced in the mPEG-Dp-group: 5.1% compared to 9.0% in the Dp-group (P less than 0.01). In the mPEG-Dp-group, reactions were mild to moderate, mainly late-occurring asthma and urticaria, whereas two episodes of anaphylaxis and four of severe asthma occurred in the Dp-group. The reduction in side effects seems promising, but a further dose increase in the mPEG-Dp-group would be necessary to compare the side effects of doses with equal therapeutic effectiveness. High frequency of late local reactions made dose increase impossible with the present slightly modified extract. The systemic side effects occurred more frequently in patients highly skin test-sensitive to Dp prior to treatment. All patients skin test-positive to less than or equal to 100 BU had systemic reactions. Systemic side effects could not be predicted from the size of previous local reactions. Priorities for Advancing Research on Youth with Autism Spectrum Disorder and Co-occurring Anxiety.Research on anxiety disorders in youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has burgeoned in the past two decades. Yet, critical gaps exist with respect to measuring and treating anxiety in this population. This study used the nominal group technique to identify the most important research priorities on co-occurring anxiety in ASD. An international group of researchers and clinicians with experience in ASD and anxiety participated in the process. Topics ranked as most important focused on understanding how ASD symptoms affect treatment response, implementing treatments in real world settings, developing methods to disentangle overlapping symptoms between anxiety and ASD, and developing objective measures to assess anxiety. Collectively, these priorities can lead to collaborative studies to accelerate research in the field.\n",

Comparing the Neural Responses of Action Understanding in Adolescents With and Without Autism.Understanding another's actions, including what they are doing and why they are doing it, can be difficult for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This understanding is supported by the action observation (AON) and mentalizing (MZN) networks, as well as the superior temporal sulcus. We examined these areas in children with ASD and typically developing controls by having participants view eating and placing actions performed in conventional and unconventional ways while functional magnetic resonance images were collected. We found an effect of action-type, but not conventionality, in both groups, and a between groups difference only when viewing conventional eating actions. Findings suggest there are not global AON/MZN deficits in ASD, and observing unconventional actions may not spontaneously activate the MZN.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Abnormalities in interactions of Rho GTPases with scaffolding proteins contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders.Accumulating evidence suggests that Rho GTPases, together with scaffolding SHANK proteins, and associated signaling pathways play a role in the development of autism symptoms in various conditions. Research data have brought information on multiple intracellular signaling pathways, including Rho-associated protein kinases and serine/threonine-protein kinases involved in cytoskeleton rearranging. Alterations in downstream effectors of GTPase signaling pathways are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Bioinformatics and experimental data show that complex genetic and molecular defects (GTPases, actin-binding proteins, kinases, neuropeptides) can result in neuronal remodeling, leading to the functional connectivity deficits that manifest as the heterogeneous autism spectrum phenotype. Finally, the known hormone and neuropeptide oxytocin appears to be a factor for consideration in therapeutic intervention.\n",

      "ABSTRACT PSD95: A synaptic protein implicated in schizophrenia or autism?The molecular components of the postsynaptic density (PSD) in excitatory synapses of the brain are currently being investigated as one of the major etiologies of neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia (SCZ) and autism. Postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) is a major regulator of synaptic maturation by interacting, stabilizing and trafficking N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors (NMDARs) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isox-azoleproprionic acid receptors (AMPARs) to the postsynaptic membrane. Recently, there has been overwhelming evidence that associates PSD-95 disruption with cognitive and learning deficits observed in SCZ and autism. For instance, recent genomic and sequencing studies of psychiatric patients highlight the aberrations at the PSD of glutamatergic synapses that include PSD-95 dysfunction. In animal studies, PSD-95 deficiency shows alterations in NMDA and AMPA-receptor composition and function in specific brain regions that may contribute to phenotypes observed in neuropsychiatric pathologies. In this review, we describe the role of PSD-95 as an essential scaffolding protein during synaptogenesis and neurodevelopment. More specifically, we discuss its interactions with NMDA receptor subunits that potentially affect glutamate transmission, and the formation of silent synapses during critical time points of neurodevelopment. Furthermore, we describe how PSD-95 may alter dendritic spine morphologies, thus regulating synaptic function that influences behavioral phenotypes in SCZ versus autism. Understanding the role of PSD-95 in the neuropathologies of SCZ and autism will give an insight of the cellular and molecular attributes in the disorders, thus providing treatment options in patients affected.\n",

Even though play skills are associated with children's production of language, few studies have focused on play for minimally verbal children. Fifty-eight minimally verbal children with ASD received a naturalistic developmental behavioral intervention. Children were randomized to receive a speech generating device in the context of the intervention or not. Children in both conditions improved in play skills at exit. Children demonstrated an increase in play skills in proximal (sessions) and distal (during blind assessment) contexts. Minimally verbal children with ASD can improve their play skills within a targeted intervention. Increases in symbolic play were associated with increases in expressive language skills.\n",

In Experiment 1, we showed that each participant's repetitive behavior persisted without social consequences. In Experiment 2, we used the FOCSA to identify high-preference, low-stereotypy (HP-LS) items for 11 participants and high-preference, high-stereotypy (HP-HS) items for nine participants. To validate the results of the FOCSAs (Experiment 3), we used a three-component multiple schedule to evaluate the immediate and subsequent effects of an HP-LS stimulus, an HP-HS stimulus, or both (in separate test sequences) on each participant's stereotypy. Results of Experiment 3 showed that the FOCSA correctly predicted the immediate effect of the HP-LS stimulus for 10 of 11 participants; however, the FOCSA predictions were less accurate for the HP-HS stimulus. Results of Experiment 4 showed that a differential reinforcement of other behavior procedure in which participants earned access to the HP-LS for omitting vocal stereotypy increased all five participants' latency to engaging in stereotypy; however, clinically significant omission durations were only achieved for one participant. Experiment 5 showed that differential reinforcement of alternative behavior in which participants earned access to the HP-LS stimulus contingent upon correct responses during discrete-trial training reduced targeted and nontargeted stereotypy and increased correct academic responding for all four participants. The potential utility of the FOCSA is discussed.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Impaired repair of DNA damage is associated with autistic-like traits in rats prenatally exposed to valproic acid.Prenatal exposure to the antiepileptic and mood stabilizer valproic acid (VPA) is an environmental risk factor for autism spectrum disorders (ASD), although recent epidemiological studies show that the public awareness of this association is still limited. Based on the clinical findings, prenatal VPA exposure in rodents is a widely used preclinical model of ASD. However, there is limited information about the precise biochemical mechanisms underlying the link between ASD and VPA. Here, we tested the effects of increasing doses of VPA on behavioral features resembling core and secondary symptoms of ASD in rats. Only when administered prenatally at the dose of 500mg/kg, VPA induced deficits in communication and social discrimination in rat pups, and altered social behavior and emotionality in the adolescent and adult offspring in the absence of gross malformations. This dose of VPA inhibited histone deacetylase in rat embryos and favored the formation of DNA double strand breaks (DSB), but impaired their repair. The defective DSB response was no more visible in one-day-old pups, thus supporting the hypothesis that unrepaired VPA-induced DNA damage at the time of neural tube closure may underlie the autistic-like traits displayed in the course of development by rats prenatally exposed to VPA. These experiments help to understand the neurodevelopmental trajectories affected by prenatal VPA exposure and identify a biochemical link between VPA exposure during gestation and ASD.\n",

This study used magnetoencephalography to investigate auditory processing differences for those with a high degree of a non-clinical autistic and schizotypal trait phenotype, Social Disorganisation (SD). Participants were 18 low (9 female) and 19 high (9 female) SD scorers (18-40 years) who completed a three-stimulus auditory oddball paradigm of speech sounds (standard: 100ms 'o', deviant: 150ms 'o', novel: 150ms 'e'). Spatio-temporal cluster analysis revealed increased amplitude for the high SD group in a left (p = 0.006) and a right (p = 0.020) hemisphere cluster in response to the novel non-target. No cluster differences were found in response to the target deviant. These findings suggest that those with a high degree of the SD phenotype recruit more cortical resources when processing unattended, novel speech stimuli, which may lead to psychosocial deficits.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Chronic Intranasal Oxytocin has Dose-dependent Effects on Central Oxytocin and Vasopressin Systems in Prairie Voles (Microtus ochrogaster).Oxytocin (Oxt) is a neuropeptide with many functions, including modulation of social behavior(s) and anxiety. Due to its notable pro-social effects, it has been proposed as a treatment in the management of neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, and social anxiety; however, effects of long-term daily treatment are still being explored. Previously, we have shown that in male prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) exposure to Oxt during the peri-adolescent period impaired adult pair bonding in a dose-dependent fashion. In females, the medium dose used (0.8 IU/kg) appeared to facilitate pair bonding, and the low and medium doses were associated with fewer lines crossed in the open field. In this study, we examined central receptor binding and immunoreactive (IR) protein for Oxt and vasopressin (Avp), a closely related peptide. Voles were treated with saline vehicle, or one of three doses of Oxt (0.08, 0.8, 8.0 IU/kg) for three weeks from postnatal days 21 to 42, and euthanized as adults. We used autoradiography to examine Oxt and Avp receptor binding and immunohistochemistry to examine Oxt and Avp - IR cells in the paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic (SON) nuclei of the hypothalamus. Females that received the medium dose of Oxt had higher Oxt receptor binding in the nucleus accumbens shell (NAS), while males that received the medium dose had lower Avp-IR cells in the PVN. In summary, we found sex-specific effects of long-term exposure to intranasal Oxt on the Oxt and Avp systems at the weight-adjusted dose currently being used in clinical trials in humans.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Developmental Connectivity and Molecular Phenotypes of Unique Cortical Projection Neurons that Express a Synapse-Associated Receptor Tyrosine Kinase.The complex circuitry and cell-type diversity of the cerebral cortex are required for its high-level functions. The mechanisms underlying the diversification of cortical neurons during prenatal development have received substantial attention, but understanding of neuronal heterogeneity is more limited during later periods of cortical circuit maturation. To address this knowledge gap, connectivity analysis and molecular phenotyping of cortical neuron subtypes that express the developing synapse-enriched MET receptor tyrosine kinase were performed. Experiments used a MetGFP transgenic mouse line, combined with coexpression analysis of class-specific molecular markers and retrograde connectivity mapping. The results reveal that MET is expressed by a minor subset of subcerebral and a larger number of intratelencephalic projection neurons. Remarkably, MET is excluded from most layer 6 corticothalamic neurons. These findings are particularly relevant for understanding the maturation of discrete cortical circuits, given converging evidence that MET influences dendritic elaboration and glutamatergic synapse maturation. The data suggest that classically defined cortical projection classes can be further subdivided based on molecular characteristics that likely influence synaptic maturation and circuit wiring. Additionally, given that MET is classified as a high confidence autism risk gene, the data suggest that projection neuron subpopulations may be differentially vulnerable to disorder-associated genetic variation.\n",

We present detailed phenotypic information on seven unrelated individuals with a recurrent de novo nonsense variant (c.2737C>T [p.Arg913Ter]) in the penultimate exon of ZSWIM6 who have severe-profound intellectual disability and additional central and peripheral nervous system symptoms but an absence of frontonasal or limb malformations. We show that the c.2737C>T variant does not trigger nonsense-mediated decay of the ZSWIM6 mRNA in affected individual-derived cells. This finding supports the existence of a truncated ZSWIM6 protein lacking the Sin3-like domain, which could have a dominant-negative effect. This study builds support for a key role for ZSWIM6 in neuronal development and function, in addition to its putative roles in limb and craniofacial development, and provides a striking example of different variants in the same gene leading to distinct phenotypes.\n",

This is a self-report questionnaire for continuous and quantitative assessment of autistic spectrum traits in adults. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed on the five-factor model (social skill, attention switching, attention to detail, communication and imagination) proposed by the original authors, support not being found for this model in our sample. An exploratory factor analysis was then performed that resulted in an alternative three-factor model (social skills, details/patterns and imagination). Confirmatory factor analysis of the latter model revealed adequate psychometric indexes. The Brazilian version of the AQ was shown to be an adequate instrument for the evaluation of signs compatible with the autism spectrum in adults.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Implementing and evaluating early intervention for children with autism: Where are the gaps and what should we do?Despite recent advances, the evidence base supporting early intervention for young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remains relatively sparse. The International Society for Autism Research (INSAR) recently sponsored a Special Interest Group (SIG) on Implementing and Evaluating Community-Based Early Intervention. Across three meetings, in 2015, 2016, and 2017, conveners of this SIG engaged >200 members to identify knowledge gaps and research priorities for moving the field forward. Here, we summarize the perspectives that emerged from group discussion at the SIG meetings as represented by scholars working actively in the field. Despite encouraging progress, critical gaps and research priorities were identified across all the stages of intervention development and testing from conceptualization to community implementation. Key issues include the need for (a) formal theories to guide early intervention development, evaluation, and implementation; and alignment of intervention goals with scientific knowledge and societal changes that have occurred in the decades since interventions were originally developed; (b) increased focus on feasibility of treatment procedures and alignment with stakeholder values during pilot evaluations; (c) use of research designs that allow for comparisons of different interventions and formats, analyses of active ingredients of treatment, and identification of moderators and mediators of outcome; (d) use of community-partnered participatory research to guide adaptation of intervention models to community settings; (e) inclusion of constructs related to implementation processes and outcomes in treatment trials and; (f) an iterative approach to the progression of knowledge from intervention development to implementation.

      "ABSTRACT Syntactic and Story Structure Complexity in the Narratives of High- and Low-Language Ability Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.Although language impairment is commonly associated with the autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the Diagnostic Statistical Manual no longer includes language impairment as a necessary component of an ASD diagnosis (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). However, children with ASD and no comorbid intellectual disability struggle with some aspects of language whose precise nature is still outstanding. Narratives have been extensively used as a tool to examine lexical and syntactic abilities, as well as pragmatic skills in children with ASD. This study contributes to this literature by investigating the narrative skills of 30 Greek-speaking children with ASD and normal non-verbal IQ, 16 with language skills in the upper end of the normal range (ASD-HL), and 14 in the lower end of the normal range (ASD-LL). The control group consisted of 15 age-matched typically-developing (TD) children. Narrative performance was measured in terms of both microstructural and macrostructural properties. Microstructural properties included lexical and syntactic measures of complexity such as subordinate vs. coordinate clauses and types of subordinate clauses. Macrostructure was measured in terms of the diversity in the use of internal state terms (ISTs) and story structure complexity, i.e., children's ability to produce important units of information that involve the setting, characters, events, and outcomes of the story, as well as the characters' thoughts and feelings. The findings demonstrate that high language ability and syntactic complexity pattern together in ASD children's narrative performance and that language ability compensates for autistic children's pragmatic deficit associated with the production of Theory of Mind-related ISTs. Nevertheless, both groups of children with ASD (high and low language ability) scored lower than the TD controls in the production of Theory of Mind-unrelated ISTs, modifier clauses and story structure complexity.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Error-related brain activity and anxiety symptoms in youth with autism spectrum disorder.Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often experience symptoms associated with generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and social anxiety disorder. In other populations, these same symptoms are associated with a larger error-related negativity (ERN), an event-related potential that reflects endogenous threat sensitivity. As such, it is possible that the ERN may relate to the clinical presentation of anxiety in ASD. However, studies examining these associations in youth with ASD have yielded mixed results. The present study aimed to clarify this relationship by examining the ERN in relation to these specific anxiety symptoms in ASD, and by accounting for typical covariates (e.g., age, verbal abilities, depression, ASD symptoms) of the ERN. Fifty-one youth, ages 8-17, with ASD and intact cognitive ability completed a modified Flanker task, from which the ERN component was obtained. Measures of anxiety, verbal abilities, depression, and ASD symptoms were collected from participants and parents. Results revealed that greater self-reported social anxiety symptoms, specifically performance fears but not humiliation/rejection fears, were associated with an increased neural response to errors, as measured by the ERN. This relationship remained after controlling for other anxiety symptoms, as well as age, verbal IQ, depression symptoms, and ASD symptoms. Findings suggest that heightened threat sensitivity may be characteristic of individuals with ASD who exhibit social fearfulness.

      "ABSTRACT Cellular Phenotypes in Human iPSC-Derived Neurons from a Genetic Model of Autism Spectrum Disorder.A deletion or duplication in the 16p11.2 region is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. In addition to clinical characteristics, carriers of the 16p11.2 copy-number variant (CNV) manifest opposing neuroanatomical phenotypes-e.g., macrocephaly in deletion carriers (16pdel) and microcephaly in duplication carriers (16pdup). Using fibroblasts obtained from 16pdel and 16pdup carriers, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and differentiated them into neurons to identify causal cellular mechanisms underlying neurobiological phenotypes. Our study revealed increased soma size and dendrite length in 16pdel neurons and reduced neuronal size and dendrite length in 16pdup neurons. The functional properties of iPSC-derived neurons corroborated aspects of these contrasting morphological differences that may underlie brain size. Interestingly, both 16pdel and 16pdup neurons displayed reduced synaptic density, suggesting that distinct mechanisms may underlie brain size and neuronal connectivity at this locus.\n",

In this study, we evaluated an assessment of job-related social skills for individuals with ASD by arranging conditions that simulated on-the-job experiences in a clinic setting. The experimenter contrived situations to assess a variety of social skills, including asking for help, asking for more materials, and responding to corrective feedback. A total of eight individuals, aged 16 to 32 years, participated. Results suggested that the assessment was useful for identifying specific social skills that could be targeted for intervention to increase success in the work environment. These findings add to the current literature by demonstrating an objective method for assessing a variety of job-related social skills under controlled, naturalistic conditions.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Using Multiple Exemplar Training to Teach Empathy Skills to Children with Autism.The purpose of the study was to use multiple exemplar training to teach empathetic responding to two children with autism. Three emotions-happiness, frustration and sadness/pain-were chosen for this purpose. Treatment consisted of verbal prompting and reinforcement of empathetic responses. Four experimenter-defined categories with discriminative stimuli were used for each emotion. The multiple exemplar component of the model consisted of teaching responses in the presence of several discriminative stimuli drawn from the predefined categories for each emotion delivered by two persons across two environments. Results were evaluated using a multiple baseline design across behaviours and indicate a systematic increase in responses with the introduction of treatment across each category for both participants. Generalization of responses from training to non-training stimuli in both participants was observed during probe trials and was maintained during follow-up probes.\n",

Given that the authors are employed by a large international health insurance carrier and conduct peer reviews on behalf of that organization, this response seeks to provide guidance from both the clinical and public policy perspectives that reflect best practices in the field of autism treatment. This response is not written with the intention of providing or replacing legal advice; rather, this paper offers health care providers of ABA an essential understanding of some of the laws that govern and support their efforts to secure medically necessary treatment and the mechanisms in place with which to challenge decisions by managed care organizations, health plans, and health insurance issuers that may be contrary to best practices. Finally, suggestions are offered on how to navigate a peer review to ensure optimal outcomes and, when necessary, to lay the groundwork to overturn a funding source decision that does not reflect best practices or the standard of care in ABA-based autism treatment.\n",

Problem behavior was occasioned by interruptions to an ongoing activity. Advance notice, in the form of a 2-min warning, and the sound of a timer were used to signal termination of a current activity and were effective at reducing problem behavior along with increasing compliance to the interruptive demands. A trial-based functional analysis, which are not common in the applied literature, was conducted in a home setting for young girl with autism, using antecedent and consequence modifications described by Hagopian, Bruzek, Bowman, and Jennett (2007), identified the variables that occasioned and maintained problem behavior were interruptions to an ongoing activity followed by regaining uninterrupted access to the previous activity. Mixed findings have been reported regarding the effectiveness of advance notice for decreasing problem behavior. Results of the current study show that an advance notice treatment package was effective for a child with autism; no escape extinction was necessary.

Estimating the proportion of evidence-based interventions engaged, identifying the agencies influencing parental decisions, and elucidating the barriers or reasons leading to intervention rejection or discontinuation can result in better service provision. New Zealand parents (n = 570) of a child with autism reported what interventions were being engaged, and why some interventions were engaged but not others. Funding was a major determinant of intervention engagement, while medical professionals exerted the most influence. Sources of support were not related to intervention engagement, but parental perceptions of their child's symptom severity were. Finally, non-engagement does not necessarily reflect parental opposition to an intervention, but rather the existence of barriers.\n",

      "ABSTRACT A novel approach to training attention and gaze in ASD: A feasibility and efficacy pilot study.In addition to the social, communicative and behavioral symptoms that define the disorder, individuals with ASD have difficulty re-orienting attention quickly and accurately. Similarly, fast re-orienting saccadic eye movements are also inaccurate and more variable in both endpoint and timing. Atypical gaze and attention are among the earliest symptoms observed in ASD. Disruption of these foundation skills critically affects the development of higher level cognitive and social behavior. We propose that interventions aimed at these early deficits that support social and cognitive skills will be broadly effective. We conducted a pilot clinical trial designed to demonstrate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of using gaze-contingent video games for low-cost in-home training of attention and eye movement. Eight adolescents with ASD participated in an 8-week training, with pre-, mid- and post-testing of eye movement and attention control. Six of the eight adolescents completed the 8 weeks of training and all six showed improvement in attention (orienting, disengagement) and eye movement control or both. All game systems remained intact for the duration of training and all participants could use the system independently. We delivered a robust, low-cost, gaze-contingent game system for home use that, in our pilot training sample, improved the attention orienting and eye movement performance of adolescent participants in 8 weeks of training. We are currently conducting a clinical trial to replicate these results and to examine what, if any, aspects of training transfer to more real-world tasks. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

      "ABSTRACT Aberrant development of the asymmetry between hemispheric brain white matter networks in autism spectrum disorder.Atypical brain asymmetry/lateralization has long been hypothesized for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and this model has been repeatedly supported by various neuroimaging studies. Recently, hemispheric network topologies have been found to be asymmetric, thereby providing a new avenue for investigating brain asymmetries under various conditions. To date, however, how network topological asymmetries are altered in ASD remains largely unexplored. To clarify this, the present study included ASD individuals from the newly released Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange II database (58 right-handed male ASD individuals aged 5 to 26 years and 70 age- and IQ-matched typically developing (TD) individuals). Diffusion and structural magnetic resonance imaging were used to construct hemispheric white matter networks, and graph-theory approaches were applied to quantify topological efficiencies for hemispheric networks. Statistical analyses revealed a decreased rightward asymmetry of network efficiencies with increasing age in the TD group, but not in the ASD group. More specifically, the TD group did not exhibit an age-related increase in network efficiency in the right hemisphere, but the ASD group did. For the left hemisphere, no difference between the groups was observed for the developmental trajectory of network efficiencies. Intriguingly, within the ASD group, more severe restricted and repetitive behavior in ASD was found to be correlated with less rightward asymmetry of network local efficiency. These findings provide suggestive evidence of atypical network topological asymmetries and offer important insights into the abnormal development of ASD brains.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Copy number variants in people with autism spectrum disorders and co-morbid psychosis.The genetic association between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia is complicated and mirrors the clinical overlap between these conditions to some degree. However, no studies to date have examined the genetics of individuals dually diagnosed with both ASD and psychosis. In this study, we present findings of copy number variants (CNVs) from a study of 116 well-characterised individuals with this dual diagnosis. DNA was extracted and arrayed using the Affymetrix CytoScan HD 2.8M array or the Affymetrix Cytogenetics arrays and compared with existing samples from the Database of Genomic Variants and the Simons Simplex Collection of CNVs from individuals with ASD and their families. Twenty-seven novel CNVs ≥20k base pairs were identified in the sample, most occurring in only a single individual, although two were found in two female participants. Forty-nine rare CNVs (<1.5% rate in general population) were also found at significantly higher frequencies than expected. The findings may provide evidence for areas of further study in the understanding of the development of both ASD and psychosis due to the number of affected genetic regions that have not previously been linked to these conditions.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Tourette syndrome and other neurodevelopmental disorders: a comprehensive review.Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (TS) is a complex developmental neuropsychiatric condition in which motor manifestations are often accompanied by comorbid conditions that impact the patient's quality of life. In the DSM-5, TS belongs to the \"neurodevelopmental disorders\" group, together with other neurodevelopmental conditions, frequently co-occurring. In this study, we searched the PubMed database using a combination of keywords associating TS and all neurodevelopmental diagnoses. From 1009 original reports, we identified 36 studies addressing TS and neurodevelopmental comorbidities. The available evidence suggests the following: (1) neurodevelopmental comorbidities in TS are the rule, rather than the exception; (2) attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most frequent; (3) there is a continuum from a simple (TS + ADHD or/and learning disorder) to a more complex phenotype (TS + autism spectrum disorder). We conclude that a prompt diagnosis and a detailed description of TS comorbidities are necessary not only to understand the aetiological basis of neurodevelopmental disorders but also to address specific rehabilitative and therapeutic approaches.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Altered Expression of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Related Genes in the Middle Frontal Cortex of Subjects with Autism Spectrum Disorder.The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an important organelle responsible for the folding and sorting of proteins. Disturbances in ER homeostasis can trigger a cellular response known as the unfolded protein response, leading to accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER lumen called ER stress. A number of recent studies suggest that mutations in autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-susceptible synaptic genes induce ER stress. However, it is not known whether ER stress-related genes are altered in the brain of ASD subjects. In the present study, we investigated the mRNA expression of ER stress-related genes (ATF4, ATF6, PERK, XBP1, sXBP1, CHOP, and IRE1) in the postmortem middle frontal gyrus of ASD and control subjects. RT-PCR analysis showed significant increases in the mRNA levels of ATF4, ATF6, PERK, XBP1, CHOP, and IRE1 in the middle frontal gyrus of ASD subjects. In addition, we found a significant positive association of mRNA levels of ER stress genes with the diagnostic score for stereotyped behavior in ASD subjects. These results, for the first time, provide the evidence of the dysregulation of ER stress genes in the brain of subjects with ASD.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Beyond Autism: Introducing the Dialectical Misattunement Hypothesis and a Bayesian Account of Intersubjectivity.Drawing on sociocultural theories and Bayesian accounts of brain function, in this article we construe psychiatric conditions as disorders of social interaction to fully account for their complexity and dynamicity across levels of description and temporal scales. After an introduction of the theoretical underpinnings of our integrative approach, we take autism spectrum conditions (ASC) as a paradigm example and discuss how neurocognitive hypotheses can be translated into a Bayesian formulation, i.e., in terms of predictive processing and active inference. We then argue that consideration of individuals (even within a Bayesian framework) will not be enough for a comprehensive understanding of psychiatric conditions and consequently put forward the dialectical misattunement hypothesis, which views psychopathology not merely as disordered function within single brains but also as a dynamic interpersonal mismatch that encompasses various levels of description. Moving from a mere comparison of groups, i.e., \"healthy\" persons versus \"patients,\" to a fine-grained analysis of social interactions within dyads and groups of individuals will open new avenues and may allow to avoid an overly neurocentric scope in psychiatric research as well as help to reduce social exclusion.\n",

      "ABSTRACT An exploratory longitudinal study of social and language outcomes in children with autism in bilingual home environments.Little is known about outcomes of early intervention for children with autism spectrum disorder reared in bilingual homes. There are concerns that social communication deficits among children with autism spectrum disorder may reduce the developmental benefits of early intervention for children with autism spectrum disorder raised in bilingual environments. We conducted an exploratory analysis of cross-sectional and longitudinal data from a larger study to explore associations between home language environment and language ability and social skills in response to early autism spectrum disorder intervention. Participants, aged 12-26 months when recruited, were a subset of a larger 2-year, randomized intervention trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00698997). Children from bilingual homes ( n = 13) began intervention with lower gesture use but otherwise demonstrated equal baseline language and social abilities as compared with age and nonverbal IQ-matched children from monolingual homes ( n = 24). Significant language growth was exhibited by children from both language groups and there was no moderating effect of home language environment. The bilingual home group demonstrated increased gesture use over the course of intervention as compared with the monolingual home group. Preliminary data revealed no basis for concerns regarding negative impact of a bilingual home environment on language or social development in young children with autism spectrum disorder.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Autism spectrum disorder: Consensus guidelines on assessment, treatment and research from the British Association for Psychopharmacology.An expert review of the aetiology, assessment, and treatment of autism spectrum disorder, and recommendations for diagnosis, management and service provision was coordinated by the British Association for Psychopharmacology, and evidence graded. The aetiology of autism spectrum disorder involves genetic and environmental contributions, and implicates a number of brain systems, in particular the gamma-aminobutyric acid, serotonergic and glutamatergic systems. The presentation of autism spectrum disorder varies widely and co-occurring health problems (in particular epilepsy, sleep disorders, anxiety, depression, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and irritability) are common. We did not recommend the routine use of any pharmacological treatment for the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder. In children, melatonin may be useful to treat sleep problems, dopamine blockers for irritability, and methylphenidate, atomoxetine and guanfacine for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The evidence for use of medication in adults is limited and recommendations are largely based on extrapolations from studies in children and patients without autism spectrum disorder. We discuss the conditions for considering and evaluating a trial of medication treatment, when non-pharmacological interventions should be considered, and make recommendations on service delivery. Finally, we identify key gaps and limitations in the current evidence base and make recommendations for future research and the design of clinical trials.\n",

The L1 elements found in the human brain is hypothesized to date back 56 million years ago and has survived evolution, currently accounting for 17% of the human genome. L1 retrotransposition has been theorized to contribute to somatic mosaicism. This review focuses on the presence of L1 in the healthy and diseased human brain, such as in autism spectrum disorders. Throughout this exploration, we will discuss the impact L1 has on neurological disorders that can occur throughout the human lifetime.

We compared interpretations of bullying provided by 22 autistic and 15 non-autistic college students. Autistic (and non-autistic) students reported less severe bullying in college relative to earlier in development. Chronic bullying was associated with improvements in self-descriptions and self-acceptance. Autistic students who were chronically bullied were more likely to self-identify as autistic when asked to explain their disability. Autistic and non-autistic students demonstrated similar levels of cognitive empathy, providing no evidence that a \"double empathy problem\" contributes to bullying for all autistic individuals.

Research on mental imitation in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has been rather limited compared to that on motor imitation. The main objective of this fMRI study is to determine the differences in brain responses underlying mirroring and mentalizing networks during mental imitation in children and adolescents with ASD. Thirteen high-functioning children and adolescents with ASD and 15 age-and- IQ-matched typically developing (TD) control participants took part in this fMRI study. In the MRI scanner, participants were shown cartoon pictures of people performing everyday actions (Transitive actions: e.g., ironing clothes but with the hand missing; and Intransitive actions: e.g., clapping hands with the palms missing) and were asked to identify which hand or palm orientation would best fit the gap. The main findings are: 1) both groups performed equally while processing transitive and intransitive actions; 2) both tasks yielded activation in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) in ASD and TD groups; 3) Increased activation was seen in ASD children, relative to TD, in left ventral premotor and right middle temporal gyrus during intransitive actions; and 4) ASD symptom severity positively correlated with activation in left parietal, right middle temporal, and right premotor regions across all subjects. Overall, our findings suggest that regions mediating mirroring may be recruiting more brain resources in ASD and may have implications for understanding social movement through modeling.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Autism: Hard to Switch from Details to the Whole.It has long been proposed that individuals with autism exhibit a superior processing of details at the expense of an impaired global processing. This theory has received some empirical support, but results are mixed. In this research we have studied local and global processing in ASD and Typically Developing children, with an adaptation of the Navon task, designed to measure congruency effects between local and global stimuli and switching cost between local and global tasks. ASD children showed preserved global processing; however, compared to Typically Developing children, they exhibited more facilitation from congruent local stimuli when they performed the global task. In addition, children with ASD had more switching cost than Typically Developing children only when they switched from the local to the global task, reflecting a specific difficulty to disengage from local stimuli. Together, results suggest that ASD is characterized by a tendency to process local details, they benefit from the processing of local stimuli at the expense of increasing cost to disengage from local stimuli when global processing is needed. Thus, this work demonstrates experimentally the advantages and disadvantages of the increased local processing in children with ASD.\n",

      "ABSTRACT De novo variants in KLF7 are a potential novel cause of developmental delay/intellectual disability, neuromuscular and psychiatric symptoms.Due to small numbers of reported patients with pathogenic variants in single genes, the phenotypic spectrum associated with genes causing neurodevelopmental disorders such as intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder is expanding. Among these genes is KLF7 (Krüppel-like factor 7), which is located at 2q33.3 and has been implicated in several developmental processes. KLF7 has been proposed to be a candidate gene for the phenotype of autism features seen in patients with a 2q33.3q34 deletion. Herein, we report 4 unrelated individuals with de novo KLF7 missense variants who share similar clinical features of developmental delay/ID, hypotonia, feeding/swallowing issues, psychiatric features and neuromuscular symptoms, and add to the knowledge about the phenotypic spectrum associated with KLF7 haploinsufficiency.\n",

The purpose of our study was to preliminarily test the decision-making algorithms of the iSTIM using trained university students to implement the assessments and interventions. Specifically, we examined the effects of the iSTIM on stereotypy and functional engagement in 11 children with ASD within alternating treatment designs. Using the iSTIM reduced engagement in stereotypy for eight participants and increased functional engagement for four of those participants. Our results indicate that the iSTIM may decrease engagement in stereotypy but that some of the decision-making algorithms may benefit from modifications prior to testing with parents.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Atypical PT anatomy in children with autism spectrum disorder with expressive language deficits.Deficits in communication are a core feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), however, structural language abilities are highly variable, ranging from minimally verbal to superior linguistic skills. Differences in the anatomy of cortical language regions, including anterior and posterior areas, have been found in ASD. It remains unclear, however, if anatomical differences distinguish individuals with impaired expressive language from those without such deficits. In addition, anatomical differences have not been explored in children with extremely low expressive language. This study included 34 boys with ASD, 7-11 years old, including an expressive language impaired group (n = 17) and an average-high language group (n = 17). The language impaired group was subdivided into a low (n = 9) and extremely low (n = 8) language subgroup for exploratory analyses to determine whether children with ASD with extremely low expressive language abilities exhibit distinct anatomy. Gray matter volume of the pars triangularis, pars opercularis, and planum temporale (PT) were measured on MRIs. PT volume was smaller in the ASD group with expressive language impairment relative to those without language deficits. The right PT volume was also positively correlated with language scores. The exploratory analyses revealed differences in the left PT, with smaller volume in the extremely low language subgroup, relative to the average and moderately low language groups. Results suggest that smaller PT volumes in both hemispheres are associated with severe language impairments in ASD. The PT may therefore, be a biomarker of language outcome in young children with ASD, with more studies of PT anatomy necessary.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Multimodal approaches to functional connectivity in autism spectrum disorders: An integrative perspective.Atypical functional connectivity has been implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). However, the literature to date has been largely inconsistent, with mixed and conflicting reports of hypo- and hyper-connectivity. These discrepancies are partly due to differences between various neuroimaging modalities. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) measure distinct indices of functional connectivity (e.g., blood-oxygenation level-dependent [BOLD] signal vs. electrical activity). Furthermore, each method has unique benefits and disadvantages with respect to spatial and temporal resolution, vulnerability to specific artifacts, and practical implementation. Thus far, functional connectivity research on ASDs has remained almost exclusively unimodal; therefore, interpreting findings across modalities remains a challenge. Multimodal integration of fMRI, EEG, and MEG data is critical in resolving discrepancies in the literature, and working toward a unifying framework for interpreting past and future findings. This review aims to provide a theoretical foundation for future multimodal research on ASDs. First, we will discuss the merits and shortcomings of several popular theories in ASD functional connectivity research, using examples from the literature to date. Next, the neurophysiological relationships between imaging modalities, including their relationship with invasive neural recordings, will be reviewed. Finally, methodological approaches to multimodal data integration will be presented, and their future application to ASDs will be discussed. Analyses relating transient patterns of neural activity (\"states\") are particularly promising. This strategy provides a comparable measure across modalities, captures complex spatiotemporal patterns, and is a natural extension of recent dynamic fMRI research in ASDs. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

      "ABSTRACT [Tools and techniques to improve the oral health of children with autism].Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a life-long heterogeneous psychiatric disorder, characterized by impaired social interaction and communication, and the presence of repetitive and stereotyped behaviors as well as restricted interests. These features have an impact on the oral health of these individuals: high risk of dental caries, poorer periodontal status, and bruxism are often described. Children with ASD often provide limited collaboration with medical procedures, particularly those considered invasive such as dental care. Children with ASD are prone to agitation, self-injury, and emotional dysregulation; they can also present hypersensitivity to sensory input. These features make it difficult for professionals to examine and treat children with ASD; they interfere with dental care and constitute a barrier to it. Most of them are treated under general anesthesia or sedation. Therefore, children with ASD present a challenge for the dental community. Adapted and specific strategies are required to allow individuals with ASD to go beyond the barriers of dental care. Different tools and techniques of evidence-based practice can be considered: visual pedagogy, behavioral approaches, and numeric devices can be used. Pediatricians have a key role in the oral care of children with autism. The aim of this article is to present the oral health associated with ASD, to set out the possible ways to improve oral health, to enable the practitioner to detect problems, to raise awareness, and to help patients and their families in their care pathway.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Visual Motion Prediction and Verbal False Memory Performance in Autistic Children.Recent theoretical accounts propose that atypical predictive processing can explain the diverse cognitive and behavioral features associated with autism, and that difficulties in making predictions may be related to reduced contextual processing. In this pre-registered study, 30 autistic children aged 6-14 years and 30 typically developing children matched in age and non-verbal IQ completed visual extrapolation and false memory tasks to assess predictive abilities and contextual processing, respectively. In the visual extrapolation tasks, children were asked to predict when an occluded car would reach the end of a road and when an occluded set of lights would fill up a grid. Autistic children made predictions that were just as precise as those made by typically developing children, across a range of occlusion durations. In the false memory task, autistic and typically developing children did not differ significantly in their discrimination between items presented in a list and semantically related, non-presented items, although the data were insensitive, suggesting the need for larger samples. Our findings help to refine theoretical accounts by challenging the notion that autism is caused by pervasively disordered prediction abilities. Further studies will be required to assess the relationship between predictive processing and context use in autism, and to establish the conditions under which predictive processing may be impaired.

      "ABSTRACT Chorioamnionitis, IL-17A, and fetal origins of neurologic disease.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 1 in 323 infants have cerebral palsy. Highly correlated to intrauterine infection and inflammation, the incidence of cerebral palsy has remained constant over the last few decades despite significant advances in neonatal intensive care including improved ventilator techniques, surfactant therapy, maternal steroid administration, and use of intrapartum empiric antimicrobials. Recent advances in our understanding of immune responses to infection and inflammation have identified the cytokine IL-17A as a crucial component of early proinflammatory mediators that cause brain injury associated with neurologic impairment. Remarkably, maternal inflammatory responses to in utero inflammation and infection can also lead to potentially debilitating neurologic conditions in the offspring, which often become clinically apparent during childhood and/or early adulthood. This review details the role of IL-17A in fetal and maternal proinflammatory responses that lead to fetal brain injury and neurologic sequelae, including cerebral palsy. Recent findings regarding the role of maternal inflammatory responses in the development of childhood and adult neurologic conditions, such as autism, schizophrenia, and multiple sclerosis, will also be highlighted.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Subtyping cognitive profiles in Autism Spectrum Disorder using a Functional Random Forest algorithm.DSM-5 Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) comprises a set of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by deficits in social communication and interaction and repetitive behaviors or restricted interests, and may both affect and be affected by multiple cognitive mechanisms. This study attempts to identify and characterize cognitive subtypes within the ASD population using our Functional Random Forest (FRF) machine learning classification model. This model trained a traditional random forest model on measures from seven tasks that reflect multiple levels of information processing. 47 ASD diagnosed and 58 typically developing (TD) children between the ages of 9 and 13 participated in this study. Our RF model was 72.7% accurate, with 80.7% specificity and 63.1% sensitivity. Using the random forest model, the FRF then measures the proximity of each subject to every other subject, generating a distance matrix between participants. This matrix is then used in a community detection algorithm to identify subgroups within the ASD and TD groups, and revealed 3 ASD and 4 TD putative subgroups with unique behavioral profiles. We then examined differences in functional brain systems between diagnostic groups and putative subgroups using resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rsfcMRI). Chi-square tests revealed a significantly greater number of between group differences (p < .05) within the cingulo-opercular, visual, and default systems as well as differences in inter-system connections in the somato-motor, dorsal attention, and subcortical systems. Many of these differences were primarily driven by specific subgroups suggesting that our method could potentially parse the variation in brain mechanisms affected by ASD.\n",

      "ABSTRACT ANKRD11 associated with intellectual disability and autism regulates dendrite differentiation via the BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway.Haploinsufficiency of ANKRD11 due to deletion or truncation mutations causes KBG syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and craniofacial abnormalities. However, little is known about the neurobiological role of ANKRD11 during brain development. Here we show that ANKRD11 regulates pyramidal neuron migration and dendritic differentiation in the developing mouse cerebral cortex. Using an in utero manipulation approach, we found that Ankrd11 knockdown delayed radial migration of cortical neurons. ANKRD11-deficient neurons displayed markedly reduced dendrite growth and branching as well as abnormal dendritic spine morphology. Ankrd11 knockdown suppressed acetylation of epigenetic molecules such as p53 and Histone H3. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of Trkb, Bdnf, and neurite growth-related genes were downregulated in ANKRD11-deficient cortical neurons. The Trkb promoter region was largely devoid of acetylated Histone H3 and p53, and was instead occupied with MeCP2 and DNMT1. Overexpression of TrkB rescued abnormal dendrite growth in these cells. Our findings demonstrate a novel role for ANKRD11 in neuron differentiation during brain development and suggest an epigenetic modification as a potential key molecular feature underlying KBG syndrome.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Analysis of Evidence-Based Autism Symptoms Enhancement by Acupuncture.Autism is considered as a complex developmental disability that appears during the first two years of life. It is considered as a neurological disorder that affects brain function leading to impaired development in social interaction and communication skills. Some clinical trials demonstrated that certain acupuncture points play relatively significant role in improving both signs and symptoms of this disease. Owing to limited information available about acupuncture point's combination and protocols, the present study aimed to explore the most frequently used acupuncture points and their channels for children with autism. Thirteen articles about autism enhancement were selected from 2007 to 2015. Acupoints and their channels used in these articles were analyzed according to usage frequencies. The present study identified the following main channels that contribute to autism symptoms enhancement along with the corresponding points' frequencies: Governing Vessel channel (12), Gall bladder channel (9), Kidney channel (8), Pericardium channel (7), Extra points channel (7), Liver channel (7), Heart channel (6), Conception vessel channel (6), and Bladder channel (6). On the other hand, the frequency of each corresponding acupuncture points are EX-HN1 (5), GV-17 (4), PC-6 (4), LR-3 (3), KI-3 (3), HT-7 (3), Lu-9 (3), GV-20 (2), GV-24 (2), GV-24.5 (2), GB-13(2), GB-19 (2), KI-4 (2), LR-4 (2), ST-36 (2), SP-3 (2), SP-6 (2). In conclusion, the consensus is that both channels and points may have an important role in autism symptoms enhancement. Based on the present study, the specific channels and points selection and stimulation types need further investigation through clinical trials.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Transdiagnostic deviant facial recognition for implicit negative emotion in autism and schizophrenia.Impaired facial affect recognition (FAR) is observed in schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and has been linked to amygdala and fusiform gyrus dysfunction. ASD patient's impairments seem to be more pronounced during implicit rather than explicit FAR, whereas for schizophrenia data are inconsistent. However, there are no studies comparing both patient groups in an identical design. The aim of this three-group study was to identify (i) whether FAR alterations are equally present in both groups, (ii) whether they are present rather during implicit or explicit FAR, (iii) and whether they are conveyed by similar or disorder-specific neural mechanisms. Using fMRI, we investigated neural activation during explicit and implicit negative and neutral FAR in 33 young-adult individuals with ASD, 20 subjects with paranoid-schizophrenia and 25 IQ- and gender-matched controls individuals. Differences in activation patterns between each clinical group and controls, respectively were found exclusively for implicit FAR in amygdala and fusiform gyrus. In addition, the ASD group additionally showed reduced activations in medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), bilateral dorso-lateral PFC, ventro-lateral PFC, posterior-superior temporal sulcus and left temporo-parietal junction. Although subjects with ASD showed more widespread altered activation patterns, a direct comparison between both patient groups did not show disorder-specific deficits in neither patient group. In summary, our findings are consistent with a common neural deficit during implicit negative facial affect recognition in schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders.\n",

However, the impact of these behaviors on families remains largely unknown. This study explored how caregivers of minimally verbal children with ASD responded to their child's sensory behaviors. Using a mixed-methods approach, we examined two variables for each endorsed child behavior: (1) Did the caregiver respond/try to change the behavior? and (2) What response did they employ? Caregivers did not differ in the frequency of responses to hypo- or hyper-responsive behaviors but employed different responses. Caregivers responded to more social sensory behaviors and predominately changed their own behavior in response to their child's. Our findings demonstrate how extensively caregivers adapt to their child's behaviors and vary their response dependent on behavior exhibited.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The TBR1-related autistic-spectrum-disorder phenotype and its clinical spectrum.A diverse range of genetic aberrations can lead to Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and many of these have been identified via Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) as part of large scale consortium studies. ASD is a phenotypically variable disorder and detailed clinical descriptions are essential to appreciate genotype-phenotype relationships. In this report, we provide a comprehensive clinical description of a child with ASD in whom a TBR1 variant was identified. We review this case in the context of the current TBR1 literature and highlight the variable spectrum of disease associated with this gene. The phenotypic information outlined within the literature is incomplete, exemplifying the limitations of massively-parallel sequencing studies with regards to clinical annotation. We suggest that future reporting of ASD variants should include standardised phenotypic descriptions. This would develop a more thorough understanding of genotype-phenotype relationship, so allowing us to better counsel and support our patients.\n",

      "ABSTRACT DHA Mitigates Autistic Behaviors Accompanied by Dopaminergic Change in a Gene/Prenatal Stress Mouse Model.Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is characterized by impairments in social interaction, social communication, and repetitive and stereotyped behaviors. Recent work has begun to explore gene × environmental interactions in the etiology of ASD. We previously reported that prenatal stress exposure in stress-susceptible heterozygous serotonin transporter (SERT) KO pregnant dams in a mouse model resulted in autism-like behavior in the offspring (SERT/S mice). The association between prenatal stress and ASD appears to be affected by maternal SERT genotype in clinical populations as well. Using the mouse model, we examined autistic-like behaviors in greater detail, and additionally explored whether diet supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) may mitigate the behavioral changes. Only male SERT/S mice showed social impairment and stereotyped behavior, and DHA supplementation ameliorated some of these behaviors. We also measured monoamine levels in the SERT/S mice after three treatment paradigms: DHA-rich diet continuously from breeding (DHA diet), DHA-rich diet only after weaning (CTL/DHA diet) and control diet only (CTL diet). The dopamine (DA) content in the striatum was significantly increased in the SERT/S mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice, whereas no difference was observed with noradrenaline and serotonin content. Moreover, DA content in the striatum was significantly reduced in the SERT/S mice with the DHA-rich diet provided continuously from breeding. The results indicate that autism-associated behaviors and changes in the dopaminergic system in this setting can be mitigated with DHA supplementation.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Identification of the antigenic epitopes of maternal autoantibodies in autism spectrum disorders.Several groups have described the presence of fetal brain-reactive maternal autoantibodies in the plasma of some mothers whose children have autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We previously identified seven autoantigens targeted by these maternal autoantibodies, each of which is expressed at significant levels in the developing brain and has demonstrated roles in typical neurodevelopment. To further understand the binding repertoire of the maternal autoantibodies, as well as the presence of any meaningful differences with respect to the recognition and binding of these ASD-specific autoantibodies to each of these neuronal autoantigens, we utilized overlapping peptide microarrays incubated with maternal plasma samples obtained from the Childhood Autism Risk from Genetics and Environment (CHARGE) Study. In an effort to identify the most commonly recognized (immunodominant) epitope sequences targeted by maternal autoantibodies for each of the seven ASD-specific autoantigens, arrays were screened with plasma from mothers with children across diagnostic groups (ASD and typically developing (TD)) that were positive for at least one antigen by western blot (N = 67) or negative control mothers unreactive to any of the autoantigens (N = 18). Of the 63 peptides identified with the discovery microarrays, at least one immunodominant peptide was successfully identified for each of the seven antigenic proteins using subsequent selective screening microarrays. Furthermore, while limited by our relatively small sample size, there were peptides that were distinctly recognized by autoantibodies relative to diagnosis For example, reactivity was observed exclusively in mothers of children of ASD towards several peptides, including the LDH-B peptides DCIIIVVSNPVDILT (9.1% ASD vs. 0% TD; odds ratio (95% CI) = 6.644 (0.355-124.384)) and PVAEEEATVPNNKIT (5.5% ASD vs. 0% TD; odds ratio (95% CI) = 4.067 (0.203-81.403)).These results suggest that there are differences in the binding repertoire between the antigen positive ASD and TD maternal samples. Further, the autoantibodies in plasma from mothers of children with ASD bound to a more diverse set of peptides, and there were specific peptide binding combinations observed only in this group. Future studies are underway to determine the critical amino acids necessary for autoantibody binding, which will be essential in developing a potential therapeutic strategy for maternal autoantibody related (MAR) ASD.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Mitochondrial Etiology of Neuropsychiatric Disorders.The brain has the highest mitochondrial energy demand of any organ. Therefore, subtle changes in mitochondrial energy production will preferentially affect the brain. Considerable biochemical evidence has accumulated revealing mitochondrial defects associated with neuropsychiatric diseases. Moreover, the mitochondrial genome encompasses over a thousand nuclear DNA genes plus hundreds to thousands of copies of the maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Therefore, partial defects in either the nuclear DNA or mtDNA genes or combinations of the two can be sufficient to cause neuropsychiatric disorders. Inherited and acquired mtDNA mutations have recently been associated with autism spectrum disorder, which parallels previous evidence of mtDNA variation in other neurological diseases. Therefore, mitochondrial dysfunction may be central to the etiology of a wide spectrum of neurological diseases. The mitochondria and the nucleus communicate to coordinate energy production and utilization, providing the potential for therapeutics by manipulating nuclear regulation of mitochondrial gene expression.\n",

We estimated the proportion of cases with Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Intellectual disability (ID) in prison, their comorbidity, and associations with disruptive behaviours and with psychiatric symptoms. Further, we examined the role of coexisting ND on psychiatric symptoms and attitudes toward violence. All 390 male inmates underwent an assessment that included the Diagnostic Interview for ADHD in Adults 2.0, the Autism Quotient, the Learning Disability Screening Questionnaire, the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), and measures of disruptive behaviours and attitudes towards violence. The percentage of cases with ADHD, ASD and ID were 25%, 9% and 9%. Inmates with ADHD and those with ID had significantly higher levels of disruptive behaviours. The combined ADHD/ASD group had significantly higher scores on global severity symptoms than either ADHD or ASD only. Meanwhile, the combined ADHD/ID group had significantly higher scores of behavioural disturbance than the ADHD-only group. Our findings show the extent of ND in prison, their inter-relations and associations with further mental health problems. Vulnerabilities conferred by ND within the criminal justice system should be addressed via interventions and preventative strategies.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Epilepsy in patients with autism: links, risks and treatment challenges.Autism is more common in people with epilepsy, approximately 20%, and epilepsy is more common in people with autism with reported rates of approximately 20%. However, these figures are likely to be affected by the current broader criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which have contributed to an increased prevalence of autism, with the result that the rate for ASD in epilepsy is likely to be higher and the figure for epilepsy in ASD is likely to be lower. Some evidence suggests that there are two peaks of epilepsy onset in autism, in infancy and adolescence. The rate of autism in epilepsy is much higher in those with intellectual disability. In conditions such as the Landau-Kleffner syndrome and nonconvulsive status epilepticus, the epilepsy itself may present with autistic features. There is no plausible mechanism for autism causing epilepsy, however. The co-occurrence of autism and epilepsy is almost certainly the result of underlying factors predisposing to both conditions, including both genetic and environmental factors. Conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety and sleep disorders are common in both epilepsy and autism. Epilepsy is generally not a contraindication to treating these conditions with suitable medication, but it is important to take account of relevant drug interactions. One of the greatest challenges in autism is to determine why early childhood regression occurs in perhaps 25%. Further research should focus on finding the cause for such regression. Whether epilepsy plays a role in the regression of a subgroup of children with autism who lose skills remains to be determined.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Decreased plasma agmatine levels in autistic subjects.Agmatine is a polyamine endogenously synthesized from arginine and is considered to be a new neurotransmitter. Agmatine has been implicated in the pathophysiology of several diseases such as anxiety disorder, depression, and schizophrenia. Agmatine also possesses anticonvulsant, neuroprotective, antiapoptotic, antioxidant, anxiolytic, and antidepressant effects. Furthermore, agmatine inhibits the nitric oxide synthase enzyme and exerts antagonist effects on NMDA, alpha-2, and imidazoline receptors. Considering these characteristics, the present study investigated whether agmatine plays a role in the pathogenesis of autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs). Therefore, plasma agmatine levels were evaluated in 34 patients with ASD and 28 non-ASD controls. Plasma agmatine levels were measured using the HPLC method. The study found remarkably lower agmatine levels in patients with ASD compared with the non-ASD control group (p < 0.001). These findings support the notion that agmatine might contribute to the pathogenesis of ASD and may serve as a new target for treatment.\n",

      "ABSTRACT What can autism teach us about the role of sensorimotor systems in higher cognition? New clues from studies on language, action semantics, and abstract emotional concept processing.Within the neurocognitive literature there is much debate about the role of the motor system in language, social communication and conceptual processing. We suggest, here, that autism spectrum conditions (ASC) may afford an excellent test case for investigating and evaluating contemporary neurocognitive models, most notably a neurobiological theory of action perception integration where widely-distributed cell assemblies linking neurons in action and perceptual brain regions act as the building blocks of many higher cognitive functions. We review a literature of functional motor abnormalities in ASC, following this with discussion of their neural correlates and aberrancies in language development, explaining how these might arise with reference to the typical formation of cell assemblies linking action and perceptual brain regions. This model gives rise to clear hypotheses regarding language comprehension, and we highlight a recent set of studies reporting differences in brain activation and behaviour in the processing of action-related and abstract-emotional concepts in individuals with ASC. At the neuroanatomical level, we discuss structural differences in long-distance frontotemporal and frontoparietal connections in ASC, such as would compromise information transfer between sensory and motor regions. This neurobiological model of action perception integration may shed light on the cognitive and social-interactive symptoms of ASC, building on and extending earlier proposals linking autistic symptomatology to motor disorder and dysfunction in action perception integration. Further investigating the contribution of motor dysfunction to higher cognitive and social impairment, we suggest, is timely and promising as it may advance both neurocognitive theory and the development of new clinical interventions for this population and others characterised by early and pervasive motor disruption.\n",

We examined standardized parent ratings of symptoms from three domains (social, communication, repetitive behaviors) in large samples of typically developing children, children with ASD, and ASD subgroups. Our results suggest that the most evidence for divergence lies in typically developing children and lower severity ASD cases, while more evidence for convergence is found in a subset of cases with more severe impairment on any core feature. These results highlight the importance of subgrouping ASD given the degree of phenotypic heterogeneity present across the autism spectrum.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Immune Abnormalities in Autism Spectrum Disorder-Could They Hold Promise for Causative Treatment?Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by impairments in language and communication development, social behavior, and the occurrence of stereotypic patterns of behavior and interests. Despite substantial speculation about causes of ASD, its exact etiology remains unknown. Recent studies highlight a link between immune dysfunction and behavioral traits. Various immune anomalies, including humoral and cellular immunity along with abnormalities at the molecular level, have been reported. There is evidence of altered immune function both in cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral blood. Several studies hypothesize a role for neuroinflammation in ASD and are supported by brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, as well as evidence of microglial activation. It has been shown that immune abnormalities occur in a substantial number of individuals with ASD. Identifying subgroups with immune system dysregulation and linking specific cellular immunophenotypes to different symptoms would be key to defining a group of patients with immune abnormalities as a major etiology underlying behavioral symptoms. These determinations would provide the opportunity to investigate causative treatments for a defined patient group that may specifically benefit from such an approach. This review summarizes recent insights into immune system dysfunction in individuals with ASD and discusses the potential implications for future therapies.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Altered Brain Cholesterol/Isoprenoid Metabolism in a Rat Model of Autism Spectrum Disorders.Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) present a wide range of symptoms characterized by altered sociability, compromised communication and stereotypic/repetitive behaviors. These symptoms are caused by developmental changes, but the mechanisms remain largely unknown. Some lines of evidence suggest an impairment of the cholesterol/isoprenoid metabolism in the brain as a possible cause, but systematic analyses in rodent models of ASDs are lacking. Prenatal exposure to the antiepileptic drug valproate (VPA) is a risk factor for ASDs in humans and generates a well-established model for the disease in rodents. Here, we studied cholesterol/isoprenoid metabolism in different brain areas of infant, adolescent and adult rats prenatally exposed to VPA. VPA-treated rats present autistic-like symptoms, they show changes in cholesterol/isoprenoid homeostasis in some brain areas, a decreased number of oligodendrocytes and impaired myelination in the hippocampus. Together, our data suggest a relation between brain cholesterol/isoprenoid homeostasis and ASDs.\n",

Despite growing evidence for the positive effects of EBPs for ASD, these practices are not consistently or effectively used in schools. Although special education programs are mandated to use EBPs, there are very few evidence-based methods for selecting, implementing, and sustaining EBPs. Research focuses primarily on teacher training, without attention to contextual factors (e.g., implementation climate, attitudes toward EBPs, resource allocation, and social networks) that may impact outcomes. Using an implementation science framework, this project will prospectively examine relations between system-wide factors and teachers' use of EBPs and student education outcomes.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Modulation of Immunological Pathways in Autistic and Neurotypical Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines by the Enteric Microbiome Metabolite Propionic Acid.Propionic acid (PPA) is a ubiquitous short-chain fatty acid which is a fermentation product of the enteric microbiome and present or added to many foods. While PPA has beneficial effects, it is also associated with human disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). We previously demonstrated that PPA modulates mitochondrial dysfunction differentially in subsets of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from patients with ASD. Specifically, PPA significantly increases mitochondrial function in LCLs that have mitochondrial dysfunction at baseline [individuals with autistic disorder with atypical mitochondrial function (AD-A) LCLs] as compared to ASD LCLs with normal mitochondrial function [individuals with autistic disorder with normal mitochondrial function (AD-N) LCLs] and control (CNT) LCLs. PPA at 1 mM was found to have a minimal effect on expression of immune genes in CNT and AD-N LCLs. However, as hypothesized, Panther analysis demonstrated that 1 mM PPA exposure at 24 or 48 h resulted in significant activation of the immune system genes in AD-A LCLs. When the effect of PPA on ASD LCLs were compared to the CNT LCLs, both ASD groups demonstrated immune pathway activation, although the AD-A LCLs demonstrate a wider activation of immune genes. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified several immune-related pathways as key Canonical Pathways that were differentially regulated, specifically human leukocyte antigen expression and immunoglobulin production genes were upregulated. These data demonstrate that the enteric microbiome metabolite PPA can evoke atypical immune activation in LCLs with an underlying abnormal metabolic state. As PPA, as well as enteric bacteria which produce PPA, have been implicated in a wide variety of diseases which have components of immune dysfunction, including ASD, diabetes, obesity, and inflammatory diseases, insight into this metabolic modulator may have wide applications for both health and disease.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Relationships between autism spectrum disorder and intolerance of uncertainty.Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is a dispositional risk factor involving maladaptive responding under conditions of uncertainty. Recent data indicate that IU is likely elevated in youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and is positively correlated with anxiety. This study examined whether IU may be associated with ASD independent of anxiety. Relationships between anxiety, ASD, and IU were examined in 57 children with ASD without co-occurring intellectual disability and 32 control participants, ages 7-16 years. Hierarchal linear regressions were run to examine whether ASD variables, including emotion dysregulation, were predictive of IU when controlling for anxiety. Severity of social communication deficits, repetitive behaviors, and emotion dysregulation were each related to IU when controlling for the effects of anxiety. When these variables were entered into the regression model together, emotion dysregulation was the only significant predictor of IU. These findings suggest that IU is directly related to features of ASD possibly due to shared genetic, neurological, or psychological underpinnings.

      "ABSTRACT Pitt-Hopkins Syndrome: A Review of Current Literature, Clinical Approach, and 23-Patient Case Series.Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) is a rare, genetic disorder caused by a molecular variant of TCF4 which is involved in embryologic neuronal differentiation. PTHS is characterized by syndromic facies, psychomotor delay, and intellectual disability. Other associated features include early-onset myopia, seizures, constipation, and hyperventilation-apneic spells. Many also meet criteria for autism spectrum disorder. Here the authors present a series of 23 PTHS patients with molecularly confirmed TCF4 variants and describe 3 unique individuals. The first carries a small deletion but does not exhibit the typical facial features nor the typical pattern of developmental delay. The second exhibits typical facial features, but has attained more advanced motor and verbal skills than other reported cases to date. The third displays typical features of PTHS, however inherited a large chromosomal duplication involving TCF4 from his unaffected father with somatic mosaicism. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first chromosomal duplication case reported to date.\n",

Timing dysfunctions occur in a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders such as Parkinson's disease, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism and attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder. Several lines of evidence show that disrupted timing processing is involved in specific fronto-striatal abnormalities. The striatum encodes reinforcement learning and procedural motion, and consequently is required to represent temporal information precisely, which then guides actions in proper sequence. Previous studies highlighted the temporal scaling property of timing-relevant striatal neurons; however, it is still unknown how this is accomplished over short temporal latencies, such as the sub-seconds to seconds range.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Sensitivity to audio-visual synchrony and its relation to language abilities in children with and without ASD.Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is often accompanied by deficits in speech and language processing. Speech processing relies heavily on the integration of auditory and visual information, and it has been suggested that the ability to detect correspondence between auditory and visual signals helps to lay the foundation for successful language development. The goal of the present study was to examine whether young children with ASD show reduced sensitivity to temporal asynchronies in a speech processing task when compared to typically developing controls, and to examine how this sensitivity might relate to language proficiency. Using automated eye tracking methods, we found that children with ASD failed to demonstrate sensitivity to asynchronies of 0.3s, 0.6s, or 1.0s between a video of a woman speaking and the corresponding audio track. In contrast, typically developing children who were language-matched to the ASD group, were sensitive to both 0.6s and 1.0s asynchronies. We also demonstrated that individual differences in sensitivity to audiovisual asynchronies and individual differences in orientation to relevant facial features were both correlated with scores on a standardized measure of language abilities. Results are discussed in the context of attention to visual language and audio-visual processing as potential precursors to language impairment in ASD.

      "ABSTRACT Delivery of Oxytocin to the Brain for the Treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorder by Nasal Application.Oxytocin (OXT) is a cyclic nonapeptide, two amino acids of which are cysteine, forming an intramolecular disulfide bond. OXT is produced in the hypothalamus and is secreted into the bloodstream from the posterior pituitary. As recent studies have suggested that OXT is a neurotransmitter exhibiting central effects important for social deficits, it has drawn much attention as a drug candidate for the treatment of autism. Although human-stage clinical trials of the nasal spray of OXT for the treatment of autism have already begun, few studies have examined the pharmacokinetics and brain distribution of OXT after nasal application. The aim of this study is to evaluate the disposition, nasal absorption, and therapeutic potential of OXT after nasal administration. The pharmacokinetics of OXT after intravenous bolus injection to rats followed a two-compartment model, with a rapid initial half-life of 3 min. The nasal bioavailability of OXT was approximately 2%. The brain concentration of OXT after nasal application was much higher than that after intravenous application, despite much lower concentrations in the plasma. More than 95% of OXT in the brain was directly transported from the nasal cavity. The in vivo stress-relief effect by OXT was observed only after intranasal administration. These results indicate that pharmacologically active OXT was effectively delivered to the brain after intranasal administration. In conclusion, the nasal cavity is a promising route for the efficient delivery of OXT to the brain.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Rapport Building and Instructional Fading Prior to Discrete Trial Instruction: Moving From Child-Led Play to Intensive Teaching.Discrete trial instruction (DTI) is effective for teaching skills to children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although effective, instructional settings can become aversive resulting in avoidant and escape-related behaviors. Given the significant social impairments associated with ASD, interventions that promote social approach and reduce avoidance are warranted. Rapport building or \"pairing\" the therapist and teaching setting with highly preferred activities prior to instruction can reduce problematic behaviors during subsequent instruction. However, the path from child-led play to DTI is not well established. Instructional fading may assist in bridging this gap. Four participants with ASD who were beginning an intensive behavioral intervention program were included in the current study. Participants progressed through nine stages of pairing and instructional fading with minimal problem behavior and high percentages of in-seat and close proximity to the therapist. Guidelines for incorporating rapport building strategies prior to intensive teaching with children with ASD are proposed.\n",

The condition causes lethargy and striatal degeneration with motor impairment in humans. How propionate exerts its toxic effect is unclear. Here, we show that intravenous administration of propionate causes dose-dependent propionate accumulation in the brain and transient lethargy in mice. Propionate, an inhibitor of histone deacetylase, entered GABAergic neurons, as could be seen from increased neuronal histone H4 acetylation in the striatum and neocortex. Propionate caused an increase in GABA (γ-amino butyric acid) levels in the brain, suggesting inhibition of GABA breakdown.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use in pregnant women; pharmacogenetics, drug-drug interactions and adverse effects.Possible negative effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in pregnancy relate to congenital anomalies, negative perinatal events and neurodevelopmental outcome. Many studies are confounded by the underlying maternal disease and by pharmacogenetic and pharmacokinetic differences of these drugs. Areas covered: The possible interactions of SSRIs and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors with other drugs and the known effects of SSRIs on congenital anomalies, perinatal and neurodevelopmental outcome. Expert opinion: SSRIs should be given with caution when combined with other drugs that are metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. SSRIs apparently increase the rate of severe cardiac malformations, induce neonatal adaptation problems in up to 30% of the offspring, increase the rate of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn and possibly slightly increase the rate of prematurity and low birth weight. Most neurodevelopmental follow up studies did not find significant cognitive impairments except some transient gross motor delay, slight impairment of language abilities and possibly behavioral changes. The literature on the possible association of SSRIs with autism spectrum disorder is inconsistent; if an association exists, it is apparently throughout pregnancy. The risk associated with treatment discontinuation seems to outweigh the risk of treatment, as severe maternal depression may negatively affect the child's development. If needed, treatment should continue in pregnancy with the minimal effective dose.\n",

The TCM mechanism on the rehabilitation of infantile cerebral palsy was studied. The rules of acupoint combination on the spine and back were summarized with meridians, main points and supplementary points involved in the TCM rehabilitation of infantile cerebral palsy. In view of the theoretic study, the advantages on the early infantile motor function, such as body turning, sitting, standing and walking, were analyzed with the long-term intervention of meridian points on the spine and back. It is showed in the rehabilitation of infantile cerebral palsy that the intervention of meridian points on the spine and back improves the motor function on the back and relieves the incoordination in the development between each system and enhances the rehabilitation mechanism of the integration of Chinese and western medicine for the functional development of core stability, which provides much more effective and more precise approach to the diagnosis and treatment of infantile cerebral palsy in clinical practice.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Mild prenatal hypoxia-ischemia leads to social deficits and central and peripheral inflammation in exposed offspring.Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) resulting from intrauterine or perinatal hypoxic-ischemia (HI) is a leading cause of long-term neonatal neurodisability. While most studies of long-term outcome have focused on moderate and severe HIE in term infants, recent work has shown that those with mild HIE may have subtle neurological impairments. However, the impact of mild HI on pre-term infants is much less clear given that pre-term birth is itself a risk factor for neurodisability. Here we show that mild HI insult alters behaviour, inflammation and the corticosterone stress response in a rat model of pre-term HIE. Mild HI exposure led to social deficits in exposed offspring at postnatal day 30, without impairments in the novel object recognition test nor in the open field test. This was also accompanied by elevations in circulating adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone indicating an exaggerated stress response. There were also elevations in il-1β and il-6 but not tnf-α mRNA and protein in the brain and blood samples. In summary we find that a mild HI exposure leads to social deficits, central and peripheral inflammation, and an abnormal corticosterone response which are three core features of autism spectrum disorder. This shows that mild HI exposure may be a risk factor for an abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome in pre-term offspring.\n",

Infants were assessed prospectively at 12 and 18 months of age using the clinician administered Autism Observational Scale for Infants (AOSI) and the Autism Parent Screen for Infants (APSI) and underwent a blind independent diagnostic assessment for ASD at 36 months of age. Direct comparison of parent and clinician ratings showed poor agreement on all early behavioral signs, with parent-reported symptoms being better able to differentiate between children with and without ASD at both 12 and 18 months of age compared to clinician observations during a brief office visit. The results suggest that parents may detect some clinically informative behaviors based on their day-to-day observations more readily than do clinicians during brief clinical assessments, a result that needs to be replicated in a non-sibling cohort.

      "ABSTRACT Normal CA1 Place Fields but Discoordinated Network Discharge in a Fmr1-Null Mouse Model of Fragile X Syndrome.Silence of FMR1 causes loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and dysregulated translation at synapses, resulting in the intellectual disability and autistic symptoms of fragile X syndrome (FXS). Synaptic dysfunction hypotheses for how intellectual disabilities like cognitive inflexibility arise in FXS predict impaired neural coding in the absence of FMRP. We tested the prediction by comparing hippocampus place cells in wild-type and FXS-model mice. Experience-driven CA1 synaptic function and synaptic plasticity changes are excessive in Fmr1-null mice, but CA1 place fields are normal. However, Fmr1-null discharge relationships to local field potential oscillations are abnormally weak, stereotyped, and homogeneous; also, discharge coordination within Fmr1-null place cell networks is weaker and less reliable than wild-type. Rather than disruption of single-cell neural codes, these findings point to invariant tuning of single-cell responses and inadequate discharge coordination within neural ensembles as a pathophysiological basis of cognitive inflexibility in FXS.

      "ABSTRACT Introduction to the Special Issue: Interventions to Reduce Challenging Behavior Among Individuals With Autism Spectrum Disorder.The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is on the rise. In addition to the social communication skill deficits and restrictive repetitive behaviors and interests, many individuals with ASD engage in challenging behavior. Challenging behavior is associated with a multitude of negative outcomes. Challenging behavior may cause harm to the individual with ASD as well as limit opportunities for educational, vocational, and social participation and development. In addition, caregivers experience high stress and low quality of mental health. As a result, challenging behavior warrants intervention that is specifically tailored to the unique characteristics of individuals with ASD. The purpose of this Special Issue is to showcase recent research in the treatment of challenging behavior for individuals with ASD. This two-part Special Issue contains 12 studies that range from systematic and quality reviews of the intervention literature, to innovative treatment approaches, to studies that develop and evaluate treatments for restrictive and repetitive behaviors and interests.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Developmental social communication deficits in the Shank3 rat model of phelan-mcdermid syndrome and autism spectrum disorder.Mutations in the SHANK3 gene have been discovered in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and the intellectual disability, Phelan-McDermid Syndrome. This study leveraged a new rat model of Shank3 deficiency to assess complex behavioral phenomena, unique to rats, which display a richer social behavior repertoire than mice. Uniquely detectable emissions of ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) in rats serve as situation-dependent affective signals and accomplish important communicative functions. We report, for the first time, a call and response acoustic playback assay of bidirectional social communication in juvenile Shank3 rats. Interestingly, we found that Shank3-deficient null males did not demonstrate the enhanced social approach behavior typically exhibited following playback of pro-social USV. Concomitantly, we discovered that emission of USV in response to playback was not genotype-dependent and emitted response calls were divergent in meaning. This is the first report of these socially relevant responses using a genetic model of ASD. A comprehensive and empirical analysis of vigorous play during juvenile reciprocal social interactions further revealed fewer bouts and reduced durations of time spent playing by multiple key parameters, including reduced anogenital sniffing and allogrooming. We further discovered that male null Shank3-deficient pups emitted fewer isolation-induced USV than Shank3 wildtype controls. Postnatal whole brain anatomical phenotyping was applied to visualize anatomical substrates that underlie developmental phenotypes. The data presented here lend support for the important role of Shank3 in social communication, the core symptom domain of ASD. By increasing the number of in vivo functional outcome measures, we improved the likelihood for identifying and moving forward with medical interventions.

      "ABSTRACT Developmental change in look durations predicts later effortful control in toddlers at familial risk for ASD.Difficulties with executive functioning (EF) are common in individuals with a range of developmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Interventions that target underlying mechanisms of EF early in development could be broadly beneficial, but require infant markers of such mechanisms in order to be feasible. Prospective studies of infants at high familial risk (HR) for ASD have revealed a surprising tendency for HR toddlers to show longer epochs of attention to faces than low-risk (LR) controls. In typical development, decreases in look durations towards the end of the first year of life are driven by the development of executive attention-a foundational component of EF. Here, we test the hypothesis that prolonged attention to visual stimuli (including faces) in HR toddlers reflects early differences in the development of executive attention.\n",

      "ABSTRACT NREM sleep EEG activity and procedural memory: A comparison between young neurotypical and autistic adults without sleep complaints.Delta EEG activity (0.75-3.75 Hz) during non-Rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep reflects the thalamo-cortical system contribution to memory consolidation. The functional integrity of this system is thought to be compromised in the Autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This lead us to investigate the topography of NREM sleep Delta EEG activity in young adults with ASD and typically-developed individuals (TYP). The relationship between Delta EEG activity and sensory-motor procedural information was also examined using a rotary pursuit task. Two dependent variables were computed: a learning index (performance increase across trials) and a performance index (average performance for all trials). The ASD group showed less Delta EEG activity during NREM sleep over the parieto-occipital recording sites compared to the TYP group. Delta EEG activity dropped more abruptly from frontal to posterior regions in the ASD group. Both groups of participants learned the task at a similar rate but the ASD group performed less well in terms of contact time with the target. Delta EEG activity during NREM sleep, especially during stage 2, correlated positively with the learning index for electrodes located all over the cortex in the TYP group, but only in the frontal region in the ASD group. Delta EEG activity, especially during stage 2, correlated positively with the performance index, but in the ASD group only. These results reveal an atypical thalamo-cortical functioning over the parieto-occipital region in ASD. They also point toward an atypical relationship between the frontal area and the encoding of sensory-motor procedural memory in ASD.

      "ABSTRACT The Use of Complementary Alternative Medicine in Children and Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder.Complementary alternative medicine (CAM) is used to a greater degree in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), when compared to children and adolescents without this diagnosis. There is limited evidence supporting the use of many of these treatments in ASD, despite their popularity. Current FDA approved medications for ASD target associated behavioral symptoms of the diagnosis, not the core symptoms of social communication deficits and restricted/repetitive behaviors. These medications are also associated with concerning adverse effects. Evidence-based therapies for core symptoms, such as applied behavior analysis (ABA), are sometimes difficult for families to access for various reasons. Families are sometimes hesitant to discuss their interest in CAM with physicians. Physicians report knowledge gaps about CAM and their use in ASD and concerns about potential conflict with parents regarding differing beliefs of CAM's role in the management of ASD. It is important for physicians to know the current evidence which examines the use of CAM treatments in children and adolescents with autism so that they may have conversations with families which are informed and evidence-based.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Repint of \"Reframing autism as a behavioral syndrome and not a specific mental disorder: Implications of genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity\".Clinical and molecular genetics have advanced current knowledge on genetic disorders associated with autism. A review of diverse genetic disorders associated with autism is presented and for the first time discussed extensively with regard to possible common underlying mechanisms leading to a similar cognitive-behavioral phenotype of autism. The possible role of interactions between genetic and environmental factors, including epigenetic mechanisms, is in particular examined. Finally, the pertinence of distinguishing non-syndromic autism (isolated autism) from syndromic autism (autism associated with genetic disorders) will be reconsidered. Given the high genetic and etiological heterogeneity of autism, autism can be viewed as a behavioral syndrome related to known genetic disorders (syndromic autism) or currently unknown disorders (apparent non-syndromic autism), rather than a specific categorical mental disorder. It highlights the need to study autism phenotype and developmental trajectory through a multidimensional, non-categorical approach with multivariate analyses within autism spectrum disorder but also across mental disorders, and to conduct systematically clinical genetic examination searching for genetic disorders in all individuals (children but also adults) with autism.\n",

Overall, 76% of the affected children, 75% of the unaffected siblings, 69% of fathers and 59% of mothers were positive for either blocking or binding Ab, whereas the prevalence of this Ab in the normal controls was 29%. The Ab was highly prevalent in affected families including unaffected siblings. The appearance of these antibodies may have a familial origin but the risk of developing ASD is likely influenced by other mitigating factors since some siblings who had the antibodies were not affected. The antibody response appears heritable with the blocking autoantibody in the parents and affected child increasing the risk of ASD.

      "ABSTRACT Relationship between absolute and relative ratios of glutamate, glutamine and GABA and severity of autism spectrum disorder.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental pathology characterized by an impairment in social interaction, communication difficulties, and repetitive behaviors. Glutamate signaling abnormalities are thought to be considered as major etiological mechanisms leading to ASD. The search for amino-acidic catabolytes related to glutamate in patients with different levels of ASD might help current research to clarify the mechanisms underlying glutamate signaling and its disorders, particularly in relation to ASD. In the present study, plasma levels of the amino acids and their derivatives glutamate, glutamine, and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), associated with their relative ratios, were evaluated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique in 40 male children with ASD and in 38 age- and gender-matched neurotypical health controls. The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) was used to evaluate social cognition, and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) was used to assess subjects' behaviors. Children with ASD exhibited a significant elevation of plasma GABA and glutamate/glutamine ratio, as well as significantly lower levels of plasma glutamine and glutamate/GABA ratios compared to controls. No significant correlation was found between glutamate levels and the severity of autism, measured by CARS and SRS. In receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, the area under the curve for GABA compared to other parameters was close to one, indicating its potential use as a biomarker. Glutamine appeared as the best predictive prognostic markers in the present study. The results of the present study indicate a disturbed balance between GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission in ASD. The study also indicates that an increased plasma level of GABA can be potentially used as an early diagnostic biomarker for ASD.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Brain and behavior development in autism from birth through infancy.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous condition that affects 1 in 68 children. Diagnosis is based on the presence of characteristic behavioral impairments that emerge in the second year of life and thus is not typically made until 3 to 4 years of age. Recent studies of early brain and behavior development have provided important new insights into the nature of this condition. Autism-specific brain imaging features have been identified as early as 6 months of age, and age-specific brain and behavior changes have been demonstrated across the first 2 years of life, highlighting the developmental nature of ASD. New findings demonstrate that early brain imaging in the first year of life holds great promise for presymptomatic prediction of ASD. There is a general understanding in medicine that earlier treatment has better outcomes than later treatment, and in autism, there is an emerging consensus that earlier intervention results in more successful outcomes for the child. Examining early brain and behavior trajectories also has the potential to parse the etiologic heterogeneity in ASD, a well-recognized impediment to developing targeted, mechanistic treatments. This review highlights the current state of the science in the pursuit of early brain and behavioral markers of autism during infancy and examines the potential implications of these findings for treatment of this condition.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Autism and talent: the cognitive and neural basis of systemizing.In 2003, we proposed the hypersystemizing theory of autism. The theory proposes that the human mind possesses a systemizing mechanism (SM) that helps identify lawful regularities (often causal) that govern the input-operation-output workings of a system. The SM can be tuned to different levels, from low to high, with a normal distribution of individual differences in how strongly people search for such input-operation-out-put regularities in any data that is systemizable. Evidence suggests that people with autism are on average hypersystemizers, scoring higher than average on the systemizing quotient and on performance tests of systemizing. In this article, we consider the neural basis behind the SM, since there has been little consideration of the brain basis of systemizing. Finally, we discuss directions for future work in this field.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Sexuality in autism: hypersexual and paraphilic behavior in women and men with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder.Like nonaffected adults, individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) show the entire range of sexual behaviors. However, due to the core symptoms of the disorder spectrum, including deficits in social skills, sensory hypo- and hypersensitivities, and repetitive behaviors, some ASD individuals might develop quantitatively above-average or nonnormative sexual behaviors and interests. After reviewing the relevant literature on sexuality in high-functioning ASD individuals, we present novel findings on the frequency of normal sexual behaviors and those about the assessment of hypersexual and paraphilic fantasies and behaviors in ASD individuals from our own study. Individuals with ASD seem to have more hypersexual and paraphilic fantasies and behaviors than general-population studies suggest. However, this inconsistency is mainly driven by the observations for male participants with ASD. This could be due to the fact that women with ASD are usually more socially adapted and show less ASD symptomatology. The peculiarities in sexual behaviors in ASD patients should be considered both for sexual education and in therapeutic approaches.\n",

Although solid scientific research continues, in an attempt to find explanations and solutions, a number of nonscientific and pure myths about autism have emerged. Myths that vaccines or mercury are associated with autism have been amplified by misguided scientists; frustrated, but effective parent groups; and politicians. Preventing the protection provided by vaccination or administration of mercury-chelating agents may cause real damage to autistic individuals and to innocent bystanders who as a result may be exposed to resurgent diseases that had already been \"extinguished. \" That such myths flourish is a consequence of the authority of scientific evidence obtained by scientific methodology losing ground to alternative truths and alternative science.

      "ABSTRACT Pharmacotherapy of emotional and behavioral symptoms associated with autism spectrum disorder in children and adolescents.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by impairment in social communication and restricted patterns of behavior. Although there is no pharmacological treatment approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the core symptoms of ASD, there is mounting support in the literature for the management of behavioral symptoms associated with this developmental disorder, in particular, irritability and hyperactivity. Aripiprazole and risperidone are currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of irritability in youth with ASD. Though not FDA-approved, methylphenidate and guanfacine are effective for the management of hyperactivity in children with ASD. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are often used in clinical practice to target anxiety and compulsions; however, there is little evidence to support its use in this population. There is a great need for further research on the safety and efficacy of existing psychotropic medications in youth with ASD, as well as the development of new treatment modalities for the core and associated behavioral symptoms.\n",

The negative impacts of stress on female reproductive biological processes have been documented thoroughly at the endocrine and behavioral levels. More recently, a '3-hit' theory of autism has identified early stress as one of the hits. The multiple biochemical effects of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) indicated that it would serve as a powerful maternal immune activator.

      "ABSTRACT Formulation, stability testing, and analytical characterization of melatonin-based preparation for clinical trial.A new institutional clinical trial assessed the improvement of sleep disorders in 40 children with autism treated by immediate-release melatonin formulation in different regimens (0.5 mg, 2 mg, and 6 mg daily) for one month. The objectives of present study were to (i) prepare low-dose melatonin hard capsules for pediatric use controlled by two complementary methods and (ii) carry out a stability study in order to determine a use-by-date. Validation of preparation process was claimed as ascertained by mass uniformity of hard capsules. Multicomponent analysis by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transformed infrared (ATR-FTIR) of melatonin/microcrystalline cellulose mixture allowed to identify and quantify relative content of active pharmaceutical ingredients and excipients. Absolute melatonin content analysis by high performance liquid chromatography in 0.5 mg and 6 mg melatonin capsules was 93.6%±4.1% and 98.7%±6.9% of theoretical value, respectively. Forced degradation study showed a good separation of melatonin and its degradation products. The capability of the method was 15, confirming a risk of false negative <0.01%. Stability test and dissolution test were compliant over 18 months of storage with European Pharmacopoeia. Preparation of melatonin hard capsules was completed manually and melatonin in hard capsules was stable for 18 months, in spite of low doses of active ingredient. ATR-FTIR offers a real alternative to HPLC for quality control of high-dose melatonin hard capsules before the release of clinical batches.\n",

Twenty-nine children 2 to 6 years of age with a confirmed diagnosis of ASD participated in this randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Participants were randomized to receive AUCB or placebo, evaluated at baseline, 12, and 24 weeks, received the opposite infusion, then re-evaluated at the same time points. Evaluations included assessments of safety, Expressive One Word Picture Vocabulary Test, 4th edition, Receptive One Word Picture Vocabulary Test, 4th edition, Clinical Global Impression, Stanford-Binet Fluid Reasoning and Knowledge, and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior and Socialization Subscales. Generalized linear models were used to assess the effects of the response variables at the 12- and 24-week time periods under each condition (AUCB, placebo). There were no serious adverse events. There were trends toward improvement, particularly in socialization, but there were no statistically significant differences for any endpoints. The results of this study suggest that autologous umbilical cord infusions are safe for children with ASD. Tightly controlled trials are necessary to further progress the study of AUCB for autism.

      "ABSTRACT Spatial navigation from same and different directions: The role of executive functions, memory and attention in adults with autism spectrum disorder.To resolve some of the inconsistencies in existing research into spatial navigation in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), we tested two large age- and ability-matched groups of ASD and typically developing (TD) participants for their spatial navigation abilities in a route learning task, which has been shown to shed light on the strategies participants employ when navigating complex environments. Participants studied a route through a virtual maze by watching a short video of a first-person perspective navigating a maze. The maze included four four-way intersections that were each marked with two unique landmarks in two corners of the intersection. At test, static images of the intersections, either as seen during the video or as approached from a different direction, were presented and participants had to indicate in which direction they would need to travel (straight, left, or right) in order to follow the originally studied route. On both types of test trials, the ASD group performed worse and their difficulties were related to reduced cognitive flexibility. Eye-movement data and follow-up item-memory tests suggested that navigation difficulties may have been related to differences in attention during encoding and less spontaneous use of landmarks as cues for navigation. Spatial navigation performance was best predicted by memory for landmarks as well as by executive functions. The results are discussed in relation to theories of underlying navigation-related brain regions. More research is needed to disentangle the influence of executive functions, memory and attention on spatial navigation.

      "ABSTRACT Sensory and motor differences in Autism Spectrum Conditions and developmental coordination disorder in children: A cross-syndrome study.Recent research has shown that Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) can present with some similar symptomology as Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC). This paper therefore explored the similarities and differences in coordination and sensory responsivity between DCD and ASC. 77 children took part: 42 (35 male, 7 female) with ASC (ages 7-21: mean age 12.23 years), 26 (19 male, 7 female) with DCD (ages 7-21; mean age 11.07 years) and 9 (2 male, 7 female) with ASC and DCD (ages 8-15; mean age 12.27). All groups completed a battery of validated parent report measures online that included motor coordination (DCDQ), sensory responsivity (SPC-R) and social communication measures (AQ). Results showed no significant differences in coordination, and some significant differences in sensory responsivity between ASC and DCD (increased visual and auditory responsivity and decreased proprioception). Exploratory analysis showed that these differences showed good validity in identifying the diagnosis of ASC and DCD. These results elucidate the underlying causes of motor coordination difficulties in both conditions. Specifically, ASC coordination difficulties appear linked to visual processing impairments, whilst DCD coordination difficulties appear to be linked to spatial processing. This may aid better diagnosis and intervention for these conditions.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Meta-analysis and systematic review of the literature characterizing auditory mismatch negativity in individuals with autism.A number of past studies have used mismatch negativity (MMN) to identify auditory processing deficits in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Our meta-analysis compared MMN responses for individuals with ASD and typically developing controls (TD). We analyzed 67 experiments across 22 publications that employed passive, auditory-based MMN paradigms with ASD and TD participants. Most studies lacked design characteristics that would lead to an accurate description of the MMN. Variability between experiments measuring MMN amplitude was smaller when limited to studies that counterbalanced stimuli. Reduced MMN amplitude was found among young children with ASD compared to controls and in experiments that used nonspeech sounds. Still, few studies included adolescents or those with below-average verbal IQ. Most studies suffered from small sample sizes, and aggregating these data did not reveal significant group differences. This analysis points to a need for research focused specifically on understudied ASD samples using carefully designed MMN experiments. Study of individual differences in MMN may provide further insights into distinct subgroups within the heterogeneous ASD population.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The placental immune response is dysregulated developmentally vitamin D deficient rats: Relevance to autism.Emerging evidence suggests that maternal or developmental vitamin D (DVD) deficiency is a risk factor for Autism Spectrum Disorders. A well-established association has also been found between gestational infection and increased incidence of autism. Placenta mediates the maternal immune response in respect to the foetus. The placenta is also a major source of vitamin D and locally produced vitamin D is an essential regulator of immune function during pregnancy. Here we investigate the effects of DVD-deficiency on baseline placental immune status and in response to the well-known viral and bacterial immune activating agents polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (poly(I:C) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We show DVD-deficiency does not affect baseline inflammatory cytokines in placenta. However, when challenged with poly(I:C) but not LPS, DVD-deficient placentas from male foetuses had higher production of IL-6 and 1L-1β compared to control placentas. This suggests the developing DVD-deficient male foetus may be particularly vulnerable to maternal viral exposures. This in turn may have adverse implications for the developing male brain. In conclusion, a dysregulated placental immune response may provide a plausible mechanism for both the epidemiological links between DVD-deficiency and increased male incidence of developmental conditions such as autism.\n",

      "ABSTRACT 'Something needs to change': Mental health experiences of young autistic adults in England.There is a high incidence and prevalence of mental health problems among young people, with several barriers to help-seeking noted in this group. High rates of mental health problems have also been reported in children and adults on the autism spectrum. Taken together, young autistic people may be a particularly vulnerable group when it comes to mental health. Yet, there has been remarkably little work on the mental health needs and experiences of young autistic adults (16-25 years). Adopting a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach - in which academic researchers and young autistic adults collaborated in an equitable research partnership - we explored young autistic people's experiences of mental health problems and their perspectives on the support they sought, if any, for these problems. A total of 130 young autistic adults took part in the research: 109 completed an online survey and 21 took part in detailed interviews. The results highlight how young autistic people find it difficult to evaluate their mental health, experience high levels of stigma and often face severe obstacles when trying to access mental health support. The findings also demonstrate how listening to - and learning from - young autistic people is crucial in ensuring that their mental health needs are met.\n",

Authors collaborated with paraprofessionals to select socially important academic skills (i.e., literacy, social studies, science, and math) aligned with students' IEPs and content taught in their inclusive classes. Results from the multiple probe across participants and skills design indicated a functional relation between the paraprofessional-delivered video prompting and correct responding to academic tasks for all three elementary students with autism and intellectual disability. Implications for practitioners, study limitations, and recommendations for future research are discussed.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Genetic and neuroendocrine aspects in autism spectrum disorder].The autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was described in 1943 and is defined as a developmental disorder that affects social interaction and communication. It is usually identified in early stages of development from 18 months of age. Currently, autism is considered a neurological disorder with a spectrum covering cases of different degrees, which is associated with genetic factors, not genetic and environmental. Among the genetic factors, various syndromes have been described that are associated with this disorder. Also, the neurobiology of autism has been studied at the genetic, neurophysiological, neurochemical and neuropathological levels. Neuroimaging techniques have shown multiple structural abnormalities in these patients. There have also been changes in the serotonergic, GABAergic, catecholaminergic and cholinergic systems related to this disorder. This paper presents an update of the information presented in the genetic and neuroendocrine aspects of autism spectrum disorder.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Representing autism: Challenges of collective representation in German and Israeli associations for and of autistic people.The important work done by various associations of and for people with disabilities is legitimated by their claim for collective representation. However, there is little empirical research that examines the organizational basis for such claims. We focus on patient/disability advocacy associations that illustrate a split of representation between organizations of and for autism. Drawing on documentary analysis and semi-structured interviews conducted in 2015-2017 with members and office-holders of autism associations in Germany and Israel, we highlight several common gaps and their relations to the organizational characteristics of the associations: Representing only part of the autism spectrum, and lack of efficient procedures for including the variety of members. We conclude by discussing the language and epistemology of \"high-functioning\"/\"Aspies\" vs. \"low-functioning\"/\"Kanners\" as politically and culturally embedded, highlighting the significance and difficulties of dialogue amidst autism-related epistemic communities.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Network Analysis of UBE3A/E6AP-Associated Proteins Provides Connections to Several Distinct Cellular Processes.Perturbations in activity and dosage of the UBE3A ubiquitin-ligase have been linked to Angelman syndrome and autism spectrum disorders. UBE3A was initially identified as the cellular protein hijacked by the human papillomavirus E6 protein to mediate the ubiquitylation of p53, a function critical to the oncogenic potential of these viruses. Although a number of substrates have been identified, the normal cellular functions and pathways affected by UBE3A are largely unknown. Previously, we showed that UBE3A associates with HERC2, NEURL4, and MAPK6/ERK3 in a high-molecular-weight complex of unknown function that we refer to as the HUN complex (HERC2, UBE3A, and NEURL4). In this study, the combination of two complementary proteomic approaches with a rigorous network analysis revealed cellular functions and pathways in which UBE3A and the HUN complex are involved. In addition to finding new UBE3A-associated proteins, such as MCM6, SUGT1, EIF3C, and ASPP2, network analysis revealed that UBE3A-associated proteins are connected to several fundamental cellular processes including translation, DNA replication, intracellular trafficking, and centrosome regulation. Our analysis suggests that UBE3A could be involved in the control and/or integration of these cellular processes, in some cases as a component of the HUN complex, and also provides evidence for crosstalk between the HUN complex and CAMKII interaction networks. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the cellular functions of UBE3A and its potential role in pathways that may be affected in Angelman syndrome, UBE3A-associated autism spectrum disorders, and human papillomavirus-associated cancers.\n",

Although impaired social functioning is a core criterion of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), the role of emotion regulation ability in ASD has been largely ignored. This study investigated the association between emotion regulation and ASD symptomatology, with a specific emphasis on social impairment. We used parent-report questionnaires to assess the regulatory strategies and symptom severity of 145 youth with ASD. Results showed that: (1) more effective emotion regulation, defined by greater use of reappraisal, predicted less severe ASD symptomatology, and (2) greater use of reappraisal predicted less severe social impairment. Suppression was not predictive of general symptomatology or social functioning.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The impact on the family of the co-existing conditions of children with autism spectrum disorder.We aimed to investigate whether the impact on families of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is associated with the number and/or type of emotional and behavioral co-existing conditions that parents/carers of children with ASD reported as occurring frequently. In addition, we examined whether there was a greater impact on families if their child was male, had lower levels of language, had more severe autism symptomatology, and whether impact was associated with the number and/or type of co-existing conditions. Families were recruited from large UK research databases. 420 parents/carers of children aged 3 years 2 months to 18 years 8 months completed the revised Impact on Family (IoF) Scale and reported on the frequency/rate of their child's co-existing conditions. Parents/carers reported higher mean IoF scores if their child: had a greater number of frequent co-existing conditions; had sleep problems; was only able to communicate physically; and had more severe autism symptomatology. The development and implementation of targeted treatment and management approaches are needed to reduce the impact of co-existing conditions on family life.

      "ABSTRACT Transcriptional and splicing dysregulation in the prefrontal cortex in valproic acid rat model of autism.Gene-environmental interaction could be the major cause of autism. The aim of the current study is to detect the effects of valproic acid on gene expression profiles and alternatively spliced genes in the prefrontal cortex in rat models of autism. Female rats received a single intraperitoneal injection of 600 mg/kg valproic acid at day 12.5 post-conception, and controls were injected with saline. Only male offspring were employed in the current study. RNA sequencing was used to investigate transcriptome in the prefrontal cortex of VPA-exposed rats. There were 3228 differently expressed genes and 637 alternative spliced genes, in VPA rats compared to controls. Pathways enrichment among the differently expressed genes and alternatively spliced genes were associated with neurological diseases and neural system development. The results implied VPA affected transcriptional and splicing events genome-wide and the transcriptional and splicing events may be associated with the autistic behaviors of VPA rats.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Listening to Bedouin Mothers of Children with Autism.This article examines how Bedouin mothers in Israel describe, perceive, and interpret their experiences raising a child with autism. Data were collected using semi-structured ethnographic interviews with 18 Bedouin mothers of children with autism, aged 6-16, living in recognized and unrecognized settlements in the Negev. Analysis of the study findings shows how the subaltern status of Bedouin women, which includes their husbands' constant threats of divorce or taking a second wife, makes it difficult for them to be mobile and interact in the public sphere without the presence of a man and creates an experience unique to these mothers, which we call \"Exclusion within Exclusion\". The Bedouin mothers report not only stigmatization, a lack of social support and loneliness but also structural-cultural characteristics that prevent them from obtaining information and participating in decision-making about the child with autism and that restrict their agency in dealing with and coping with their child's autism. In light of this situation, the discussion highlights the unique connection between local cultural scripts and the phenomenology of autism.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Social partner gaze direction and conversational phase; factors affecting social attention during face-to-face conversations in autistic adults?Social attention is atypical in autism. However, the majority of evidence for this claim comes from studies where the social partner is not physically present and the participants are children. Consequently, to ensure acquisition of a comprehensive overview of social attention in autism, systematic analysis of factors known to influence face-to-face social attention in neurotypicals is necessary and evidence from adulthood is required. This study assessed the influence of experimenter gaze direction (direct or averted) and conversational phase (speaking or listening) on social attention during a face-to-face conversation. Eye-tracking analyses indicated that when the experimenter looked directly at the participant, autistic adults looked at the experimenter's face less than did neurotypical adults. However, this between-group difference was significantly reduced when the experimenter's gaze was averted. Therefore, opportunities for reciprocal social gaze are missed by autistic adults when the social partner makes direct eye contact. A greater proportion of time was spent fixating the experimenter's eye region when participants were speaking compared to listening in both neurotypical and autistic adults. Overall, this study provides a rich picture of the nature of social attention in face-to-face conversations adopted by autistic adults and demonstrates individual variation in social attention styles.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Damaging de novo mutations diminish motor skills in children on the autism spectrum.In individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), de novo mutations have previously been shown to be significantly correlated with lower IQ but not with the core characteristics of ASD: deficits in social communication and interaction and restricted interests and repetitive patterns of behavior. We extend these findings by demonstrating in the Simons Simplex Collection that damaging de novo mutations in ASD individuals are also significantly and convincingly correlated with measures of impaired motor skills. This correlation is not explained by a correlation between IQ and motor skills. We find that IQ and motor skills are distinctly associated with damaging mutations and, in particular, that motor skills are a more sensitive indicator of mutational severity than is IQ, as judged by mutational type and target gene. We use this finding to propose a combined classification of phenotypic severity: mild (little impairment of either), moderate (impairment mainly to motor skills), and severe (impairment of both IQ and motor skills).\n",

      "ABSTRACT Proneness to guilt, shame, and pride in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders and neurotypical children.Self-conscious emotions (e.g., guilt, shame, and pride) are complex emotions that require self-reflection and self-evaluation, and are thought to facilitate the maintenance of societal norms and personal standards. Despite the importance of self-conscious emotions, most research has focused on basic emotion processing in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Therefore, in the present study, we used the Test of Self-Conscious Affect for Children (TOSCA-C) to assess proneness to, or propensity to experience, the self-conscious emotions guilt, shame, and pride in children with ASD and neurotypical children. The TOSCA-C is designed to capture a child's natural tendency to experience a given emotion across a range of everyday situations [Tangney, Stuewig, & Mashek, 2007]. We also assessed how individual characteristics contribute to the development of proneness to self-conscious emotions, including theory of mind (ToM) and ASD symptomatology. In comparison to neurotypical children, children with ASD showed less proneness to guilt, although all children showed relatively high levels of proneness to guilt. Greater ToM ability was related to more proneness to guilt and authentic pride in children with ASD. Additionally, we found that children with ASD with more severe symptomatology were more prone to hubristic pride. Our results provide evidence of differences in proneness to self-conscious emotions in children with ASD, as well as highlight important mechanisms contributing to how children with ASD may experience self-conscious emotions.

A search of four databases (Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Social Science Data) was conducted to identify studies that met the following criteria: (1) an intervention was delivered to parent carers of a child with ASD under the age of 18 years; (2) the research design allowed for a comparison on outcomes across groups; and (3) outcome measures of the parent carers' mental health were used. A total of 23 studies met the inclusion criteria. A critical interpretive synthesis approach was used to produce an integrated conceptualization of the evidence. Findings suggest practitioner guidelines to support the mental health and wellbeing of parent carers should include addressing the parent's self-perspective taking and skill for real time problem-solving.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Autism spectrum disorder traits in typically developing emerging adults and associated parenting: A person-centered approach.Research on parenting children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) indicates these children receive parenting tailored to their condition. However, little is known about ASD in adulthood, especially in emerging adults at college, and how they are parented. The current study examined how emerging adults in a non-clinical typically-developing sample differed in their current perceptions of parenting as a function of ASD traits. Participants completed questionnaires about their current perceptions of parenting and self-reported ASD traits. Parenting characteristics assessed included parenting style, discipline, parent-child relationship quality, and parental distress. Results indicated that higher levels of self-reported ASD traits were associated with increasingly ineffective parenting characteristics including lower authoritative style, harsher discipline, poorer parent-child relationship quality (e.g., lower involvement), and higher parental distress. Researchers are encouraged to extend ASD research into adulthood by validating diagnostic methods with adults and investigating processes in adulthood that have been well-established in the childhood ASD literature.\n",

The current study used child- and family-level factors to identify homogeneous classes in a surveillance-based sample (n = 2303) of 8-year-old children with ASD. Using latent class analysis, a 5-class model emerged and the class memberships were examined in relation to the child's median age at ASD diagnosis. Class 3, with known language delays and a high advantage socioeconomically had the lowest age of ASD diagnosis (46.74 months) in comparison to Classes 1 (64.99 months), 4 (58.14 months), and 5 (69.78 months) in this sample.

      "ABSTRACT Employment status is related to sleep problems in adults with autism spectrum disorder and no comorbid intellectual impairment.Both sleep problems and unemployment are common in adults with autism spectrum disorder; however, little research has explored this relationship in this population. This study aimed to explore factors that may be associated with the presence of an International Classification of Sleep Disorders-Third Edition defined sleep disorder in adults with autism spectrum disorder (IQ > 80). A total of 36 adults with autism spectrum disorder and 36 controls were included in the study. Participants completed a 14-day actigraphy assessment and questionnaire battery. Overall, 20 adults with autism spectrum disorder met the International Classification of Sleep Disorders-Third Edition criteria for insomnia and/or a circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder, while only 4 controls met criteria for these disorders. Adults with autism spectrum disorder and an International Classification of Sleep Disorders-Third Edition sleep disorder had higher scores on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and were more likely to be unemployed compared to adults with autism spectrum disorder and no sleep disorder. The findings demonstrate, for the first time, that sleep problems are associated with unemployment in adults with autism spectrum disorder. Further research exploring the direction of this effect is required; sleep problems that have developed during adolescence make attainment of employment for those with autism spectrum disorder difficult, or unemployment results in less restrictions required for optimal and appropriate sleep timing.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Behavioural and emotional disorders in childhood: A brief overview for paediatricians.Mental health problems in children and adolescents include several types of emotional and behavioural disorders, including disruptive, depression, anxiety and pervasive developmental (autism) disorders, characterized as either internalizing or externalizing problems. Disruptive behavioural problems such as temper tantrums, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional, defiant or conduct disorders are the commonest behavioural problems in preschool and school age children. The routine Paediatric clinic or Family Medicine/General Practitioner surgery presents with several desirable characteristics that make them ideal for providing effective mental health services to children and adolescents. DSM-5 and ICD-10 are the universally accepted standard criteria for the classification of mental and behaviour disorders in childhood and adults. The age and gender prevalence estimation of various childhood behavioural disorders are variable and difficult to compare worldwide. A review of relevant published literature was conducted, including published meta-analyses and national guidelines. We searched for articles indexed by Ovid, PubMed, PubMed Medical Central, CINAHL, EMBASE, Database of Abstracts and Reviews, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic reviews and other online sources. The searches were conducted using a combination of search expressions including \"childhood\", \"behaviour\", \"disorders\" or \"problems\". Childhood behaviour and emotional problems with their related disorders have significant negative impacts on the individual, the family and the society. They are commonly associated with poor academic, occupational, and psychosocial functioning. It is important for all healthcare professionals, especially the Paediatricians to be aware of the range of presentation, prevention and management of the common mental health problems in children and adolescents.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Lateral inhibition in the autism spectrum: An SSVEP study of visual cortical lateral interactions.Circuit level brain dysfunction has been suggested as a common mechanism through which diverse genetic risk factors and neurobiological sequelae lead to the core features of autism spectrum disorder (Geschwind 2009; Port et al. 2014). An important mediator of circuit level brain activity is lateral inhibition, and a number of authors have suggested that lateral inhibition may be atypical in ASD. However, evidence regarding putative atypical lateral connections in ASD is mixed. Here we employed a steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) paradigm to further investigate lateral connections within a group of high functioning adults with ASD. At a group level, we found no evidence of altered lateral interactions in ASD. Exploratory analyses reveal that greater ASD symptom severity (increased ADOS score) is associated with increased short range lateral inhibition. These results suggest that lateral interactions are not altered in ASD at a group-level, but that subtle alterations in such neurobiological processes may underlie the heterogeneity seen in the autism spectrum in terms of sensory perception and behavioral phenotype.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Evidence the U.S. autism epidemic initiated by acetaminophen (Tylenol) is aggravated by oral antibiotic amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin) and now exponentially by herbicide glyphosate (Roundup).Because certain hereditary diseases show autistic behavior, and autism often runs in families, researchers seek genes underlying the pathophysiology of autism, thus core behaviors. Other researchers argue environmental factors are decisive, citing compelling evidence of an autism epidemic in the United States beginning about 1980. Recognition that environmental factors influence gene expression led to synthesis of these views - an 'epigenetic epidemic' provoked by pervasive environmental agents altering expression of vulnerable genes, inducing characteristic autistic biochemistries in many mothers and infants. Two toxins most implicated in the U.S. autism epidemic are analgesic/antipyretic acetaminophen (Tylenol) and oral antibiotic amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin). Recently herbicide glyphosate (Roundup) was exponentially implicated. What do these toxins have in common? Acetaminophen depletes sulfate and glutathione required to detoxify it. Oral antibiotics kill and glyphosate inhibits intestinal bacteria that synthesize methionine (precursor of sulfate and glutathione, and required to methylate DNA), bacteria that synthesize tryptophan (sole precursor of neuroinhibitor serotonin), and bacteria that restrain ammonia-generating anaerobes. Sulfate plus glutathione normally sulfate fetal adrenal androgen dehydroepiandrosterone to DHEAS - major precursor of placental/postnatal estrogens. Glyphosate (and heavy metals) also inhibit aromatase that turns androgens to estrogens. Placental/postnatal estrogens dehydrate/mature brain myelin sheaths, mature corpus callosum and left hemisphere preferentially, dilate brain blood vessels, and elevate brain serotonin and oxytocin. Stress-induced weak androgens and estrogen depletion coherently explain white matter asymmetry and dysconnection in autism, extreme male brain, low brain blood flow, hyperexcitability, social anxiety, and insufficient maternal oxytocin at birth to limit fetal brain chloride/water and mature GABA.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Cognitive Functions and Neurodevelopmental Disorders Involving the Prefrontal Cortex and Mediodorsal Thalamus.The mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MD) has been implicated in executive functions (such as planning, cognitive control, working memory, and decision-making) because of its significant interconnectivity with the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Yet, whilst the roles of the PFC have been extensively studied, how the MD contributes to these cognitive functions remains relatively unclear. Recently, causal evidence in monkeys has demonstrated that in everyday tasks involving rapid updating (e.g., while learning something new, making decisions, or planning the next move), the MD and frontal cortex are working in close partnership. Furthermore, researchers studying the MD in rodents have been able to probe the underlying mechanisms of this relationship to give greater insights into how the frontal cortex and MD might interact during the performance of these essential tasks. This review summarizes the circuitry and known neuromodulators of the MD, and considers the most recent behavioral, cognitive, and neurophysiological studies conducted in monkeys and rodents; in total, this evidence demonstrates that MD makes a critical contribution to cognitive functions.

      "ABSTRACT The Role of Neurohypophyseal Hormones Vasopressin and Oxytocin in Neuropsychiatric Disorders.Although the neurohypophyseal hormones vasopressin (VP) and oxytocin (OT) are mostly known for their role respectively in antidiuresis, and in labour, lactation and maternal behavior, both might exert widespread influences either on emotion and cognition in healthy subjects, showing some gender-related differences. They interact with each other facilitating shifts between positive socially- oriented and defensive states. In fact, VP amplifies the reactivity to stressors showing also beneficial effects on attention, verbal learning as well as memory, whereas OT reduces the amplitude of the stress response, improves emotion processing, and can play a negative effect on memory and verbal learning in healthy individuals. Several data indicate the possible involvement of these neuropeptides in the pathophysiology of psychiatric conditions involving social interactions, such as autism, as well as in schizophrenia and depression. The aim of this paper is to review the literature relating to the role played by neurohypophyseal hormones in neuropsychiatric disorders.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Reprint of \"Investigating ensemble perception of emotions in autistic and typical children and adolescents\".Ensemble perception, the ability to assess automatically the summary of large amounts of information presented in visual scenes, is available early in typical development. This ability might be compromised in autistic children, who are thought to present limitations in maintaining summary statistics representations for the recent history of sensory input. Here we examined ensemble perception of facial emotional expressions in 35 autistic children, 30 age- and ability-matched typical children and 25 typical adults. Participants received three tasks: a) an 'ensemble' emotion discrimination task; b) a baseline (single-face) emotion discrimination task; and c) a facial expression identification task. Children performed worse than adults on all three tasks. Unexpectedly, autistic and typical children were, on average, indistinguishable in their precision and accuracy on all three tasks. Computational modelling suggested that, on average, autistic and typical children used ensemble-encoding strategies to a similar extent; but ensemble perception was related to non-verbal reasoning abilities in autistic but not in typical children. Eye-movement data also showed no group differences in the way children attended to the stimuli. Our combined findings suggest that the abilities of autistic and typical children for ensemble perception of emotions are comparable on average.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Tuberous sclerosis complex.Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal-dominant or sporadic multisystem disorder that results from mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2. The primary organs affected include the brain, skin, lung, kidney, and heart, all with variable frequency, penetrance, and severity. There are over 2000 known allelic variants for TSC, including nonsense and misssense mutation, and all pathogenic mutations are inactivating, leading to loss-of-function effects on the encoded proteins, TSC1 and TSC2. These proteins form a complex to constitutively inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling cascade, and as a consequence, mTOR signaling is constitutively active within all TSC-associated lesions. The mTOR inhibitors rapamycin (sirolimus) and everolimus have been shown to reduce renal and brain lesion size, and improve pulmonary function in TSC, and these compounds may also decrease seizure frequency. The clinical application of mTOR inhibitors in TSC has provided one of the first examples of precision medicine in a neurodevelopmental disorder.\n",

In this commentary, we raise a different question about autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and vaccines: Are school-aged youth with ASD undervaccinated and, if so, why? There are several reasons why youth with ASD might be undervaccinated, including: belief in a vaccine-ASD link, challenges faced by youth with ASD when seeking health care and vaccine hesitancy factors that affect the general population. Possible undervaccination in this group is concerning given the prevalence of ASD and the key role of vaccinations in preventing infectious diseases. More research is needed to establish definitively whether youth with ASD are undervaccinated and to understand facilitators and barriers to vaccination for this population. This would help public health officials to develop and implement targeted policy and practice changes to increase vaccination uptake in youth with ASD, thereby increasing immunization equity.\n",

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a single-gene disorder characterized by hallmark regulatory impairments, suggesting diminished effortful control. This study compared the development of effortful control in preschool boys with FXS ( n = 97) and typical development ( n = 32). Unlike their typical peers, the boys with FXS did not exhibit growth in effortful control over time, which could not be accounted for by adaptive impairments, FMR1 molecular measures, or autism symptoms. These results contribute to our understanding of the childhood phenotype of FXS that may be linked to the poor social-emotional outcomes seen in this group.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Comparison of Treatment for Metabolic Disorders Associated with Autism:Reanalysis of Three Clinical Trials.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects about 1 in 45 individuals in the United States, yet effective treatments are yet to be defined. There is growing evidence that ASD is associated with abnormalities in several metabolic pathways, including the inter-connected folate, methylation and glutathione pathways. Several treatments that can therapeutically target these pathways have been tested in preliminary clinical trials. The combination of methylcobalamin (mB12) with low-dose folinic acid (LDFA) and sapropterin, a synthetic form of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) have been studied in open-label trials while high-dose folinic acid has been studied in a double-blind placebo controlled trial. All of these treatments have the potential to positively affect folate, methylation and glutathione pathways. Although the effect of mB12/LDFA and BH4 on methylation and glutathione metabolism have been examined in the open-label studies, these changes have not been compared to controls who received a placebo in order to account for the natural variation in the changes in these pathways. Furthermore, the recent study using high-dose folinic acid (HDFA) did not analyze the change in metabolism resulting from the treatment. Thus, we compared changes in methylation and glutathione metabolism and biomarkers of chronic oxidative stress as a result of these three treatments to individuals receiving placebo. In general, mB12/LDFA treatment had a significant effect on glutathione and cysteine metabolism with a medium effect size while BH4 had a significant effect on methylation and markers of chronic oxidative stress with a large effect size. HDFA treatment did not significantly influence biomarkers of methylation, glutathione or chronic oxidative stress. One caveat was that participants in the mB12/LDFA and BH4 studies had significantly worse markers of glutathione metabolism and chronic oxidative stress at baseline, respectively. Thus, the participants selected in these two clinical trials may have been those with the most severe metabolic abnormalities and most expected to respond to these treatments. Overall this study supports the notion that metabolic abnormalities in individuals with ASD may be amenable to targeted treatments and provide some insight into the mechanism of action of these treatments.\n",

A number of studies using resting state fMRI have shown that machine learning algorithms can distinguish between healthy controls and individuals diagnosed with either autism spectrum disorder or schizophrenia. However, it has not yet been determined whether machine learning algorithms can be used to distinguish between the two disorders. Using a linear support vector machine, we identify features that are most diagnostic for each disorder and successfully use them to classify an independent cohort of subjects. We find both common and divergent connectivity differences largely in the default mode network as well as in salience, and motor networks. Using divergent connectivity differences, we are able to distinguish autistic subjects from those with schizophrenia. Understanding the common and divergent connectivity changes associated with these disorders may provide a framework for understanding their shared cognitive deficits.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Drawing the answers: Sketching to support free and probed recall by child witnesses and victims with autism spectrum disorder.The success of witness interviews in the criminal justice system depends on the accuracy of information obtained, which is a function of both amount and quality of information. Attempts to enhance witness retrieval such as mental reinstatement of context have been designed with typically developed adults in mind. In this article, the relative benefits of mental and sketch reinstatement mnemonics are explored with both typically developing children and children with autism. Children watched a crime event video, and their retrieval of event information was examined in free and probed recall phases of a cognitive interview. As expected, typically developing children recalled more correct information of all types than children with autism during free and probed recall phases. Sketching during free recall was more beneficial for both groups in both phases in reducing the amount of incorrect items, but the relative effect of sketching on enhancing retrieval accuracy was greater for children with autism. The results indicate the benefits of choosing retrieval mnemonics that are sensitive to the specific impairments of autistic individuals and suggest that retrieval accuracy during interviews can be enhanced, in some cases to the same level as that of typically developing individuals.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Maternal and Early Postnatal Immune Activation Produce Dissociable Effects on Neurotransmission in mPFC-Amygdala Circuits.Inflammatory processes may be involved in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric illnesses including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Evidence from studies in rodents indicates that immune activation during early development can produce core features of ASD (social interaction deficits, dysregulation of communication, increases in stereotyped behaviors, and anxiety), although the neural mechanisms of these effects are not thoroughly understood. We treated timed-pregnant mice with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C), which simulates a viral infection, or vehicle on gestational day 12.5 to produce maternal immune activation (MIA). Male offspring received either vehicle or lipopolysaccharide, which simulates a bacterial infection, on postnatal day 9 to produce postnatal immune activation (PIA). We then used optogenetics to address the possibility that early developmental immune activation causes persistent alterations in the flow of signals within the mPFC to basolateral amygdala (BLA) pathway, a circuit implicated in ASD. We found that our MIA regimen produced increases in synaptic strength in glutamatergic projections from the mPFC to the BLA. In contrast, our PIA regimen produced decreases in feedforward GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic responses resulting from activation of local circuit interneurons in the BLA by mPFC-originating fibers. Both effects were seen together when the regimens were combined. Changes in the balance between excitation and inhibition were differentially translated into the modified spike output of BLA neurons. Our findings raise the possibility that prenatal and postnatal immune activation may affect different cellular targets within brain circuits that regulate some of the core behavioral signs of conditions such as ASD.\n",

Prime-target pairs were congruent or incongruent in their emotional content. Overall, congruency effects were found for combined prosody-semantic primes, however no congruency effects were found for semantic or prosodic primes alone.

The present study examined the effect of music on exercise intensity in a group of 13 elementary school students with ASD. Data were collected across six days during structured (e.g., verbal and physical prompts) and unstructured (e.g., minimal prompting) exercise periods. During these exercise periods, three music conditions were randomized: no music, slow-tempo music, and fast-tempo music. Exercise intensity, measured in Metabolic Equivalent of Tasks by triaxial accelerometers, was greatest during the structured exercise periods and during the slow music condition. Student characteristics moderated the impact of music condition on exercise intensity, such that students with high levels of adaptive behavior or lower levels of maladaptive behavior displayed greater exercise intensity during the fast music condition.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The role of Pax6 in brain development and its impact on pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorder.Pax6 transcription factor is a key player in several aspects of brain development and function. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder in which several loci and/or genes have been suggested as causative candidate factors. Based on data obtained from meta-analyses of the transcriptome and ChIP analyses, we hypothesized that the neurodevelopmental gene PAX6 regulates and/or binds to a large number of genes (including many ASD-related ones) that modulate the fate of neural stem/progenitor cells and functions of neuronal cells, subsequently affecting animal behavior. Network analyses of PAX6/ASD-related molecules revealed significant clusters of molecular interactions involving regulation of cell-cell adhesion, ion transport, and transcriptional regulation. We discuss a novel function of Pax6 as a chromatin modulator that alters the chromatin status of ASD genes, thereby inducing diverse phenotypes of ASD and related neurodevelopmental diseases.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Executive function in high-functioning autism: Decision-making consistency as a characteristic gambling behaviour.Restricted and repetitive patterns of behaviours, interests, or activities are a critical diagnostic criterion for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Previous studies using gambling paradigms with ASD populations have identified that, unlike typically developed control participants, people with a diagnosis of ASD tend to maintain particular response patterns regardless of the magnitude of potential outcomes to uncertain gains or losses. Here we designed a gambling test that permitted calculation of the response consistency in gambling choices in situations that presented varying expected outcomes in terms of gains or losses. The task was administered to 33 adults with a diagnosis of ASDs and compared to a group of 47 typically-developed (TD) control participants who were matched for age and IQ. When presented with choices where participants could either make a risky gamble or a safe choice in terms of gains or losses (e.g., 20% chance of winning £5 vs. 100% chance of winning £1), the ASD participants did not differ from the TDs in their overall risk-taking behaviour. However, they were more consistent in their individual choices from trial to trial. Furthermore, the proportion of participants who either implemented an invariate response strategy (e.g., either always choosing the most risky or most \"safe\" option) was significantly higher in the ASD group compared with the controls. Additionally, while the ASD group were slower to make their responses in the win frame and the first half of the lose frame, by the end of the task their decision times were the same as the TD controls. These findings suggest that the ASD tendency towards repetitive behaviour may demonstrate itself even in high-level decision-making tasks, which needs to be understood if we are to be sure what such tasks are measuring.\n",

Parents reported that children with ASD had high levels of anxiety and stress, and attachment insecurity in children (less closeness and more conflict in attachment relationships, and more inhibited attachment behaviours) compared with children with other developmental disabilities. Children's attachment quality was associated with parenting practices and the presence of an ASD diagnosis.

However, neither the brain regions involved in social novelty nor the underlying mechanisms are clearly understood. Here, we found decreased excitability of fast-spiking interneurons and dysfunction of gamma oscillation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which contributed to the social novelty deficit in the KI mice. Neuronal firing rates and phase-coding abnormalities were also detected in the KI mice during social interactions. Interestingly, optogenetic stimulation of parvalbumin interneurons in the mPFC at 40 Hz nested at 8 Hz positively modulated the social behaviors of mice and rescued the social novelty deficit in the KI mice. Our findings suggest that gamma oscillation dysfunction in the mPFC leads to social deficits in autism, and manipulating mPFC PV interneurons may reverse the deficits in adulthood.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Liver X receptor β regulates the development of the dentate gyrus and autistic-like behavior in the mouse.The dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus is a laminated brain region in which neurogenesis begins during early embryonic development and continues until adulthood. Recent studies have implicated that defects in the neurogenesis of the DG seem to be involved in the genesis of autism spectrum disorders (ASD)-like behaviors. Liver X receptor β (LXRβ) has recently emerged as an important transcription factor involved in the development of laminated CNS structures, but little is known about its role in the development of the DG. Here, we show that deletion of the LXRβ in mice causes hypoplasia in the DG, including abnormalities in the formation of progenitor cells and granule cell differentiation. We also found that expression of Notch1, a central mediator of progenitor cell self-renewal, is reduced in LXRβ-null mice. In addition, LXRβ deletion in mice results in autistic-like behaviors, including abnormal social interaction and repetitive behavior. These data reveal a central role for LXRβ in orchestrating the timely differentiation of neural progenitor cells within the DG, thereby providing a likely explanation for its association with the genesis of autism-related behaviors in LXRβ-deficient mice.\n",

      "ABSTRACT From intuition to intervention: developing an intonation-based treatment for autism.Autism affects ∼1.5% of children under age 8; its core symptoms include impairment in social-communicative functioning and repetitive behaviors/restricted interests. Music-based interventions have been considered one modality through which to treat autism. This report discusses considerations to take into account when developing a music-based intervention for a core symptom of autism. Treatment modality must be matched to symptom both clinically and theoretically, the behavior to be treated must be carefully defined and assessed, and outcome measures must be capable of showing improvement in that behavior over the course of the study. Fidelity assessment and rater blinding reduce experimenter bias. High inter-rater reliability for perceptually determined outcome measures helps obtain accurate estimates of treatment response. Later stages of testing compare the experimental intervention to matched control treatments or other validated therapies, isolating the intervention's \"active ingredients.\" Such systematic investigation of a new music-based intervention can provide information of different types, ranging from an assessment of whether the intervention has any effect at all to an assessment of its outcomes and risks in uncontrolled community settings. Findings ultimately compose the evidence base that clinicians and families can use to decide the most effective way of addressing symptoms of autism for particular children.\n",

      "ABSTRACT A new measure of child vocal reciprocity in children with autism spectrum disorder.Children's vocal development occurs in the context of reciprocal exchanges with a communication partner who models \"speechlike\" productions. We propose a new measure of child vocal reciprocity, which we define as the degree to which an adult vocal response increases the probability of an immediately following child vocal response. Vocal reciprocity is likely to be associated with the speechlikeness of vocal communication in young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Two studies were conducted to test the utility of the new measure. The first used simulated vocal samples with randomly sequenced child and adult vocalizations to test the accuracy of the proposed index of child vocal reciprocity. The second was an empirical study of 21 children with ASD who were preverbal or in the early stages of language development. Daylong vocal samples collected in the natural environment were computer analyzed to derive the proposed index of child vocal reciprocity, which was highly stable when derived from two daylong vocal samples and was associated with speechlikeness of vocal communication. This association was significant even when controlling for chance probability of child vocalizations to adult vocal responses, probability of adult vocalizations, or probability of child vocalizations. A valid measure of children's vocal reciprocity might eventually improve our ability to predict which children are on track to develop useful speech and/or are most likely to respond to language intervention. A link to a free, publicly-available software program to derive the new measure of child vocal reciprocity is provided.

      "ABSTRACT Mercury-associated diagnoses among children diagnosed with pervasive development disorders.Nelson and Bauman (Pediatrics 111:674-679, 2003) previously hypothesized that pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) was not associated with mercury (Hg) exposure because the medical conditions associated with Hg exposure were not associated with PDD. A hypothesis-testing longitudinal case-control study evaluated the frequency of medically diagnosed conditions previously associated with Hg poisoning, including: epilepsy, dysarthria, failure to thrive, cerebral palsy, or contact dermatitis and other eczema among children preceding their eventual PDD diagnosis (cases) compared to controls. A retrospective examination of medical records within the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) was undertaken. Cases diagnosed with PDD (n = 534) were born from 1991 to 2000 and continuously enrolled until their PDD diagnosis. Controls (n = 26,367) were born from 1991 to 1993 and continuously enrolled from birth for 7.22 years. Within the first 5 years of life, cases compared to controls were significantly (p < 0.0001) more likely to be assigned a diagnosis of contact dermatitis and other eczema (odds ratio (OR) = 2.033), dysarthria (OR = 23.992), epilepsy (OR = 5.351), failure to thrive (OR = 25.3), and cerebral palsy (OR = 4.464). Similar results were observed when the data were separated by gender. Overall, the results of the present study and recently published studies provide direct evidence supporting a link in twelve of twelve categories (100%) of Hg poisoning associated symptoms as defined by Nelson and Bauman (Pediatrics 111:674-679, 2003) and symptoms observed in those with a PDD diagnosis. The results of this study support the biological plausibility of Hg poisoning to induce PDD diagnoses and rejection of the Nelson and Bauman (Pediatrics 111:674-679, 2003) hypothesis because those with a PDD diagnosis have an increased frequency of conditions previously associated with Hg poisoning.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Teaching children with autism to explain how: A case for problem solving?Few studies have applied Skinner's (1953) conceptualization of problem solving to teach socially significant behaviors to individuals with developmental disabilities. The current study used a multiple probe design across behavior (sets) to evaluate the effects of problem-solving strategy training (PSST) on the target behavior of explaining how to complete familiar activities. During baseline, none of the three participants with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) could respond to the problems presented to them (i.e., explain how to do the activities). Tact training of the actions in each activity alone was ineffective; however, all participants demonstrated independent explaining-how following PSST. Further, following PSST with Set 1, tact training alone was sufficient for at least one scenario in sets 2 and 3 for all 3 participants. Results have implications for generative responding for individuals with ASD and further the discussion regarding the role of problem solving in complex verbal behavior.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Parent coaching increases the parents' capacity for reflection and self-evaluation: results from a clinical trial in autism.Family-centered parent coaching interventions in autism strive to encourage family engagement and support parent reflection and self-evaluation. This includes the parents' capacity to: (1) carefully observe the child's behavior; (2) reflect upon the child's thoughts, motives, and feelings; (3) consider links between the child's internal experiences and observable behavior; and (4) grapple with the complex interplay among the child's experiences and behaviors, contextual factors, parenting strategies, as well as parental goals and emotions. The current study reports data from a clinical trial of Focused Playtime Intervention (FPI), a parent coaching intervention targeting responsive parental behaviors and child communication. Seventy children with autism between 2 and 6 years and their parents were randomly assigned to participate in FPI for 12 weeks or an active control intervention. The Insightfulness Assessment was administered and used (a) to classify parents' baseline capacity for reflection and self-evaluation as either established (i.e., positively insightful) or emerging, and (b) to capture longitudinal change in the parents' capacity between baseline, exit (~5 months after baseline), and follow up (~14 months after exit) using a dimensional composite subscale score. Results revealed a significant treatment effect of FPI on growth in the parents' capacity for reflection and self-evaluation, conditional on the parents' classification at baseline. That is, parents whose capacity for reflection and self-evaluation was classified as emerging at baseline (n = 42) showed higher rates of growth when assigned to FPI, compared to the control condition. A similar treatment effect was not found for parents whose baseline capacity for reflection and self-evaluation was classified as established (i.e., positively insightful). This is the first study to show that a family-centered parent coaching intervention effectively increases the capacity for reflection and self-evaluation in parents of young children with autism. This capacity may enable parents to adapt and implement intervention strategies flexibly across contexts, daily routines, and interactions.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Anatomy-guided joint tissue segmentation and topological correction for 6-month infant brain MRI with risk of autism.Tissue segmentation of infant brain MRIs with risk of autism is critically important for characterizing early brain development and identifying biomarkers. However, it is challenging due to low tissue contrast caused by inherent ongoing myelination and maturation. In particular, at around 6 months of age, the voxel intensities in both gray matter and white matter are within similar ranges, thus leading to the lowest image contrast in the first postnatal year. Previous studies typically employed intensity images and tentatively estimated tissue probabilities to train a sequence of classifiers for tissue segmentation. However, the important prior knowledge of brain anatomy is largely ignored during the segmentation. Consequently, the segmentation accuracy is still limited and topological errors frequently exist, which will significantly degrade the performance of subsequent analyses. Although topological errors could be partially handled by retrospective topological correction methods, their results may still be anatomically incorrect. To address these challenges, in this article, we propose an anatomy-guided joint tissue segmentation and topological correction framework for isointense infant MRI. Particularly, we adopt a signed distance map with respect to the outer cortical surface as anatomical prior knowledge, and incorporate such prior information into the proposed framework to guide segmentation in ambiguous regions. Experimental results on the subjects acquired from National Database for Autism Research demonstrate the effectiveness to topological errors and also some levels of robustness to motion. Comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods further demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method in terms of both segmentation accuracy and topological correctness.\n",

Over 95% of children had at least one co-occurring condition/symptom. Overall, the prevalence was higher in 8- than 4-year-olds for 67% of co-occurring conditions/symptoms examined. Further, our data suggested that co-occurring conditions/symptoms increased or decreased the age at which children were first evaluated for ASD. Similarly, among the 8-year-olds, the prevalence of most co-occurring conditions/symptoms was higher in children with a previous ASD diagnosis documented in their records. These findings are informative for understanding and screening co-occurring conditions/symptoms in ASD.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Association Study Between Metallothionein-3 Protein Polymorphisms and Autism.Genetic susceptibility to high mercury body burden has been suggested as an autism risk factor in children. Metallothionein III (MT3) is the brain-specific form of the metallothionein family, which plays a key role in metal metabolism. We therefore looked for genetic variations in the MT3 gene that might increase the predisposition to autism. DNA was extracted from 132 autistic children and 132 age and gender-matched unrelated controls. All the samples were analyzed for nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with minor allele frequency > 10% in the MT3 gene. The mRNA levels of MT3 in white blood cells were evaluated by real-time PCR. We did not detect any association between these MT3 polymorphisms and the mRNA levels of MT3. We did not detect any association between MT3 polymorphisms and autism risk. However, we detected four novel MT3 SNPs that are not in the human SNP database. The clinical importance of these SNPs needs further investigation. Our data suggest that MT3 gene polymorphisms are not associated with autism.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Reduced Alternating Gaze During Social Interaction in Infancy is Associated with Elevated Symptoms of Autism in Toddlerhood.In typical development, infants often alternate their gaze between their interaction partners and interesting stimuli, increasing the probability of joint attention toward surrounding objects and creating opportunities for communication and learning. Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have been found to engage less in behaviors that can initiate joint attention compared to typically developing children, but the role of such atypicalities in the development of ASD during infancy is not fully understood. Here, using eye tracking technology in a live setting, we show that 10-month-olds at high familial risk for ASD engage less in alternating gaze during interaction with an adult compared to low risk infants. These differences could not be explained by low general social preference or slow visual disengagement, as the groups performed similarly in these respects. We also found that less alternating gaze at 10 months was associated with more social ASD symptoms and less showing and pointing at 18 months. These relations were similar in both the high risk and the low risk groups, and remained when controlling for general social preference and disengagement latencies. This study shows that atypicalities in alternating gaze in infants at high risk for ASD emerge already during the first 10 months of life - a finding with theoretical as well as potential practical implications.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Eyeing up the Future of the Pupillary Light Reflex in Neurodiagnostics.The pupillary light reflex (PLR) describes the constriction and subsequent dilation of the pupil in response to light as a result of the antagonistic actions of the iris sphincter and dilator muscles. Since these muscles are innervated by the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems, respectively, different parameters of the PLR can be used as indicators for either sympathetic or parasympathetic modulation. Thus, the PLR provides an important metric of autonomic nervous system function that has been exploited for a wide range of clinical applications. Measurement of the PLR using dynamic pupillometry is now an established quantitative, non-invasive tool in assessment of traumatic head injuries.

      "ABSTRACT Effects of tributyltin on placental cytokine production.Objective Tributyltin (TBT) is a persistent pollutant but its effects on placental function are poorly understood as are its possible interactions with infection. We hypothesized that TBT alters the production of sex hormones and biomarkers for inflammation and neurodevelopment in an infection-dependent manner. Methods Placental explant cultures were treated with 0-5000 nM TBT in the presence and absence of Escherichia coli. A conditioned medium was harvested and concentrations of steroids (progesterone, P4; testosterone, T and estradiol, E2) as well as biomarkers of inflammation [interleukin (IL)-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), IL-10, IL-6, soluble glycoprotein 130 (sgp-130) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1)], oxidative stress [8-iso-prostaglandin (8-IsoP)] and neurodevelopment [brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)] were quantified. Results TBT increased P4 slightly but had little or no effect on T or E2 production. IL-1β, IL-6, sgp-130, IL-10 and 8-IsoP production was enhanced by TBT. P4 and IL-6 production was also enhanced by TBT for bacteria-stimulated cultures but TBT significantly inhibited bacteria-induced IL-1β and sgp-130 production. High doses of TBT also inhibited BDNF production. Conclusions TBT increases P4 but has minimal effect on downstream steroids. It enhances the production of inflammatory biomarkers such as IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-10 and IL-6. Inhibition of sgp-130 by TBT suggests that TBT may increase bioactive IL-6 production which has been associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. Reduced expression of BDNF also supports this possibility.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Early Origins of Autism Comorbidity: Neuropsychiatric Traits Correlated in Childhood Are Independent in Infancy.Previous research has suggested that behavioral comorbidity is the rule rather than the exception in autism. The present study aimed to trace the respective origins of autistic and general psychopathologic traits-and their association-to infancy. Measurements of autistic traits and early liability for general psychopathology were assessed in 314 twins at 18 months, ascertained from the general population using birth records. 222 twins were re-evaluated at 36 months. Standardized ratings of variation in social communication at 18 months were highly heritable and strongly predicted autistic trait scores at 36 months. These early indices of autistic liability were independent from contemporaneous ratings of behavior problems on the Brief Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (which were substantially environmentally-influenced), and did not meaningfully predict internalizing or externalizing scores on the Achenbach Scales of Empirically Based Assessment at 36 months. In this general population infant twin study, variation in social communication was independent from variation in other domains of general psychopathology, and exhibited a distinct genetic structure. The commonly-observed comorbidity of specific psychiatric syndromes with autism may arise from subsequent interactions between autistic liability and independent susceptibilities to other psychopathologic traits, suggesting opportunities for preventive amelioration of outcomes of these interactions over the course of development.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Receptive language is associated with visual perception in typically developing children and sensorimotor skills in autism spectrum conditions.A number of studies have evidenced marked difficulties in language in autism spectrum conditions (ASC). Studies have also shown that language and word knowledge are associated with the same area of brain that is also responsible for visual perception in typically developing (TD) individuals. However, in ASC, research suggests word meaning is mapped differently, on to situational sensorimotor components within the brain. Furthermore, motor coordination is associated with communication skills. The current study explores whether motor coordination and visual perception are impaired in children with ASC, and whether difficulties in coordination and visual perception correlate with receptive language levels. 36 children took part: 18 with ASC and 18 TD children, matched on age and non-verbal reasoning. Both groups completed the Movement ABC, Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration, British Picture Vocabulary Scale and Matrices (WASI). Results showed that ASC children scored significantly lower on receptive language, coordination and visual motor integration than the TD group. In the TD group receptive language significantly correlated with visual perception; in the ASC group receptive language significantly correlated with balance. These results imply that sensorimotor skills are associated with the understanding of language in ASC and thus the relationship between sensorimotor experiences and language warrants further investigation.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Autistic adults show preserved normalisation of sensory responses in gaze processing.Progress in our understanding of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has recently been sought by characterising how systematic differences in canonical neural computations employed across the sensory cortex might contribute to clinical symptoms in diverse sensory, cognitive, and social domains. A key proposal is that ASD is characterised by reduced divisive normalisation of sensory responses. This provides a bridge between genetic and molecular evidence for an increased ratio of cortical excitation to inhibition in ASD and the functional characteristics of sensory coding that are relevant for understanding perception and behaviour. Here we tested this hypothesis in the context of gaze processing (i.e., the perception of other people's direction of gaze), a domain with direct relevance to the core diagnostic features of ASD. We show that reduced divisive normalisation in gaze processing is associated with specific predictions regarding the psychophysical effects of sensory adaptation to gaze direction, and test these predictions in adults with ASD. We report compelling evidence that both divisive normalisation and sensory adaptation occur robustly in adults with ASD in the context of gaze processing. These results have important theoretical implications for defining the types of divisive computations that are likely to be intact or compromised in this condition (e.g., relating to local vs distal control of cortical gain). These results are also a strong testament to the typical sensory coding of gaze direction in ASD, despite the atypical responses to others' gaze that are a hallmark feature of this diagnosis.\n",

Literature on this field have suggested that these disorders are affected by the complex interaction of genetic, biological, psychosocial and environmental risk factors. However, this complexity of interplaying risk factors during neurodevelopment has prevented a complete understanding of the causes of those neuropsychiatric symptoms. Recently, with advances in modern high-resolution neuroscience methods, the neural circuitry analysis approach has provided new solutions for understanding the causal relationship between dysfunction of a neural circuit and behavioral alteration in neurodevelopmental disorders.

      "ABSTRACT Brief Report: Developmental Trajectories of Adaptive Behavior in Children and Adolescents with ASD.Research suggests that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have significant difficulties with adaptive behavior skills including daily living and functional communication skills. Few studies have examined the developmental trajectory of adaptive behavior across childhood and adolescence. The present study examined longitudinal trajectories of adaptive behavior in a community-based clinic sample of 186 individuals with ASD. The overall pattern indicated an initial increase in adaptive behavior during early childhood followed by a plateau in skills during adolescence for individuals of all IQ groups. Given the importance of adaptive behavior for employment and quality of life, this study emphasizes the importance of targeting adaptive behavior during adolescence to insure continued gains.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Cortical responses to dynamic emotional facial expressions generalize across stimuli, and are sensitive to task-relevance, in adults with and without Autism.Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) report difficulties extracting meaningful information from dynamic and complex social cues, like facial expressions. The nature and mechanisms of these difficulties remain unclear. Here we tested whether that difficulty can be traced to the pattern of activity in \"social brain\" regions, when viewing dynamic facial expressions. In two studies, adult participants (male and female) watched brief videos of a range of positive and negative facial expressions, while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (Study 1: ASD n = 16, control n = 21; Study 2: ASD n = 22, control n = 30). Patterns of hemodynamic activity differentiated among facial emotional expressions in left and right superior temporal sulcus, fusiform gyrus, and parts of medial prefrontal cortex. In both control participants and high-functioning individuals with ASD, we observed (i) similar responses to emotional valence that generalized across facial expressions and animated social events; (ii) similar flexibility of responses to emotional valence, when manipulating the task-relevance of perceived emotions; and (iii) similar responses to a range of emotions within valence. Altogether, the data indicate that there was little or no group difference in cortical responses to isolated dynamic emotional facial expressions, as measured with fMRI. Difficulties with real-world social communication and social interaction in ASD may instead reflect differences in initiating and maintaining contingent interactions, or in integrating social information over time or context.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Characterization of Noise Signatures of Involuntary Head Motion in the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange Repository.The variability inherently present in biophysical data is partly contributed by disparate sampling resolutions across instrumentations. This poses a potential problem for statistical inference using pooled data in open access repositories. Such repositories combine data collected from multiple research sites using variable sampling resolutions. One example is the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange repository containing thousands of imaging and demographic records from participants in the spectrum of autism and age-matched neurotypical controls. Further, statistical analyses of groups from different diagnoses and demographics may be challenging, owing to the disparate number of participants across different clinical subgroups. In this paper, we examine the noise signatures of head motion data extracted from resting state fMRI data harnessed under different sampling resolutions. We characterize the quality of the noise in the variability of the raw linear and angular speeds for different clinical phenotypes in relation to age-matched controls. Further, we use bootstrapping methods to ensure compatible group sizes for statistical comparison and report the ranges of physical involuntary head excursions of these groups. We conclude that different sampling rates do affect the quality of noise in the variability of head motion data and, consequently, the type of random process appropriate to characterize the time series data. Further, given a qualitative range of noise, from pink to brown noise, it is possible to characterize different clinical subtypes and distinguish them in relation to ranges of neurotypical controls. These results may be of relevance to the pre-processing stages of the pipeline of analyses of resting state fMRI data, whereby head motion enters the criteria to clean imaging data from motion artifacts.\n",

      "ABSTRACT A Preliminary Analysis of Mastery Criterion Level: Effects on Response Maintenance.Educators use a mastery criterion to evaluate skill acquisition programming for children with autism and other developmental disabilities; however, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no research evaluating how the mastery criterion level of accuracy affects the maintenance of those responses. This study investigated the effects of 3 skill acquisition mastery criterion levels (50%, 80%, and 90% accuracy) on response maintenance. Following mastery of a set of skills, maintenance was evaluated once a week for 3 to 4 weeks. Three elementary school-age children diagnosed with autism participated. Overall, the outcomes suggested that higher mastery criterion levels (90% correct) produced higher levels of maintenance responding. Additional research in this area is needed to clarify how different parameters of mastery criterion affect the generality of skills.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Neuron numbers increase in the human amygdala from birth to adulthood, but not in autism.Remarkably little is known about the postnatal cellular development of the human amygdala. It plays a central role in mediating emotional behavior and has an unusually protracted development well into adulthood, increasing in size by 40% from youth to adulthood. Variation from this typical neurodevelopmental trajectory could have profound implications on normal emotional development. We report the results of a stereological analysis of the number of neurons in amygdala nuclei of 52 human brains ranging from 2 to 48 years of age [24 neurotypical and 28 autism spectrum disorder (ASD)]. In neurotypical development, the number of mature neurons in the basal and accessory basal nuclei increases from childhood to adulthood, coinciding with a decrease of immature neurons within the paralaminar nucleus. Individuals with ASD, in contrast, show an initial excess of amygdala neurons during childhood, followed by a reduction in adulthood across nuclei. We propose that there is a long-term contribution of mature neurons from the paralaminar nucleus to other nuclei of the neurotypical human amygdala and that this growth trajectory may be altered in ASD, potentially underlying the volumetric changes detected in ASD and other neurodevelopmental or neuropsychiatric disorders.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Impaired lipid metabolism markers to assess the risk of neuroinflammation in autism spectrum disorder.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a multifactorial disorder caused by an interaction between environmental risk factors and a genetic background. It is characterized by impairment in communication, social interaction, repetitive behavior, and sensory processing. The etiology of ASD is still not fully understood, and the role of neuroinflammation in autism behaviors needs to be further investigated. The aim of the present study was to test the possible association between prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1), prostaglandin PGE2 EP2 receptors and nuclear kappa B (NF-κB) and the severity of cognitive disorders, social impairment, and sensory dysfunction. PGE2, COX-2, mPGES-1, PGE2-EP2 receptors and NF-κB as biochemical parameters related to neuroinflammation were determined in the plasma of 47 Saudi male patients with ASD, categorized as mild to moderate and severe as indicated by the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) or the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) or the Short Sensory Profile (SSP) and compared to 46 neurotypical controls. The data indicated that ASD patients have remarkably higher levels of the measured parameters compared to neurotypical controls, except for EP2 receptors that showed an opposite trend. While the measured parameter did not correlate with the severity of social and cognitive dysfunction, PGE2, COX-2, and mPGES-1 were remarkably associated with the dysfunction in sensory processing. NF-κB was significantly increased in relation to age. Based on the discussed data, the positive correlation between PGE2, COX-2, and mPGES-1 confirm the role of PGE2 pathway and neuroinflammation in the etiology of ASD, and the possibility of using PGE2, COX-2 and mPGES-1 as biomarkers of autism severity. NF-κB as inflammatory inducer showed an elevated level in plasma of ASD individuals. Receiver operating characteristic analysis together with predictiveness diagrams proved that the measured parameters could be used as predictive biomarkers of biochemical correlates to ASD.\n",

For more than a decade, genetically-modified, risk factor-induced, as well as naturally occurring rodent models for ASD have been used as the most predominant tools to dissect the molecular and circuitry mechanisms underlying ASD. However, the apparent evolutionary differences in terms of social behavior and brain anatomy between rodents and humans have become an issue of debate regarding the translational value of rodent models for studying ASD. More recently, genome manipulation of non human primates using lentivirus-based gene expression, TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene editing techniques, has been reported. Genetically modified non-human primate models for ASD have been produced and characterized. While the feasibility, value, and exciting opportunities provided by the non-human primate models have been clearly demonstrated, many challenges still remain. Here, we review current progress, discuss the remaining challenges, and highlight the key issues in the development of non-human primate models for ASD research and drug development.

      "ABSTRACT The risk of neurodevelopmental disorders following Thimerosal-containing Hib vaccine in comparison to Thimerosal-free Hib vaccine administered from 1995 to 1999 in the United States.Investigators postulated that early-life exposure to organic mercury (Hg) significantly increases the risk of childhood neurodevelopmental disorders (NDs). The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System database was utilized to conduct a hypothesis testing case-control study by evaluating 3486 total adverse event reports reported following Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib) vaccination. Exposed subjects received a Thimerosal-containing formulation (HIBTITER™, Wyeth-Lederle), while unexposed subjects received a Thimerosal-free formulation (PEDVAXHIB™, Merck). Subjects were included if they received either of these two Hib vaccine formulations between 1995 and 1999. Cases were defined as adverse event reports with a reported outcome of autism, developmental delay, psychomotor delay, or NDs in general. Cases with reported outcomes of febrile convulsions, pyrexia, or injection site pain, all of which have no biologically plausible relation to Hg exposure, were also examined. Controls were defined as adverse event reports without any mention of the specific case outcome examined. Cases of reported autism (odds ratio (OR) = 2.75, p < 0.02), developmental delay (OR = 5.39, p < 0.01), psychomotor disorder (OR = 2.38, p < 0.03), and neurodevelopmental disorder in general (OR = 2.70, p < 0.001) were each significantly more likely than their respective controls to receive Thimerosal-containing Hib vaccine than Thimerosal-free Hib vaccine. Significant effects for neurodevelopmental disorder in general were observed for males (OR = 2.52, p < 0.005), but not females when separated by gender. For the outcomes that had no biologically plausible relation to Hg exposure, the cases were no more likely than their respective controls to receive Thimerosal-containing Hib vaccine than Thimerosal-free Hib vaccine. This study provides suggestive evidence of an association between Thimerosal and neurodevelopmental outcomes and provides support for carrying out additional well-designed studies examining the association between Thimerosal-containing vaccines and a wide range of neurodevelopmental outcomes.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Atypical audiovisual temporal function in autism and schizophrenia: similar phenotype, different cause.Binding across sensory modalities yields substantial perceptual benefits, including enhanced speech intelligibility. The coincidence of sensory inputs across time is a fundamental cue for this integration process. Recent work has suggested that individuals with diagnoses of schizophrenia (SZ) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) will characterize auditory and visual events as synchronous over larger temporal disparities than their neurotypical counterparts. Namely, these clinical populations possess an enlarged temporal binding window (TBW). Although patients with SZ and ASD share aspects of their symptomatology, phenotypic similarities may result from distinct etiologies. To examine similarities and variances in audiovisual temporal function in these two populations, individuals diagnosed with ASD (n = 46; controls n = 40) and SZ (n = 16, controls = 16) completed an audiovisual simultaneity judgment task. In addition to standard psychometric analyses, synchrony judgments were assessed using Bayesian causal inference modeling. This approach permits distinguishing between distinct causes of an enlarged TBW: an a priori bias to bind sensory information and poor fidelity in the sensory representation. Findings indicate that both ASD and SZ populations show deficits in multisensory temporal acuity. Importantly, results suggest that while the wider TBWs in ASD most prominently results from atypical priors, the wider TBWs in SZ results from a trend toward changes in prior and weaknesses in the sensory representations. Results are discussed in light of current ASD and SZ theories and highlight that different perceptual training paradigms focused on improving multisensory integration may be most effective in these two clinical populations and emphasize that similar phenotypes may emanate from distinct mechanistic causes.\n",

Here, we studied potential sex differences in a core feature of autism, difficulty with eye gaze processing, among typically developing individuals who vary in the broad autism phenotype, which includes autistic-like traits that are common, continuously distributed, and similarly heritable in males and females. Participants viewed complex images of an actor in a naturalistic scene looking at one of many possible objects and had to identify the target gazed-at object. Among males, those high in autistic-like traits exhibited worse eye gaze following performance than did those low in these traits. Among females, eye gaze following behavior did not vary with autistic-like traits. These results suggest that deficient eye gaze following behavior is part of the broader autism phenotype for males, but may not be a part of the female autism phenotype.\n",

There has been mixed evidence as to whether various ASD subtypes are qualitatively distinct or if they exist on a spectrum of symptom severity. The present study conducted a two-step cluster analysis of major ASD symptoms in a sample of 147 young males with ASD aged between 6yr and 18yr with IQ > 70. Results indicated that a two-cluster solution (high and low severity of ASD symptomatology) was reliable and valid. Further, the construct of challenging behaviour was not a necessary component of the two-cluster solution, verifying the new conceptualisation of ASD.

Animal modeling may help to identify drugs that can normalize the altered gut microbiota and thereby ameliorate abnormal brain signaling pathways.

Fifty young golden Syrian hamsters weighing between 60 and 70 g were enrolled in the study. The hamsters were randomly divided into five groups, each with ten hamsters. The hamsters in the control group only received phosphate-buffered saline orally. The PPA-treated group received a neurotoxic dose of 250 mg PPA/kg body weight (BW)/day for three days. The clindamycin-treated group received 30 mg clindamycin/kg BW as a single orogastric dose on the day the experiment started. The two therapeutic groups received the same doses of PPA and clindamycin followed by 0.2 g probiotic/kg BW for three weeks. Biochemical parameters related to glutamate excitotoxicity were investigated in brain homogenates from each group of hamsters. Additionally, the development of pathogenic bacteria was monitored in stool samples from all groups. The microbiology results of the present study revealed descriptive changes in the fecal microbiota and the appearance of Clostridium species in the hamsters treated with clindamycin and PPA. Additionally, the effectiveness of the probiotic in the restoration of the normal gut microbiota was demonstrated. Moreover, clindamycin and PPA were found to induce a significant depletion of Mg\n",

      "ABSTRACT Neural Dynamics of Autistic Repetitive Behaviors and Fragile X Syndrome: Basal Ganglia Movement Gating and mGluR-Modulated Adaptively Timed Learning.This article develops the iSTART neural model that proposes how specific imbalances in cognitive, emotional, timing, and motor processes that involve brain regions like prefrontal cortex, temporal cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum may interact together to cause behavioral symptoms of autism. These imbalances include underaroused emotional depression in the amygdala/hypothalamus, learning of hyperspecific recognition categories that help to cause narrowly focused attention in temporal and prefrontal cortices, and breakdowns of adaptively timed motivated attention and motor circuits in the hippocampus and cerebellum. The article expands the model's explanatory range by, first, explaining recent data about Fragile X syndrome (FXS), mGluR, and trace conditioning; and, second, by explaining distinct causes of stereotyped behaviors in individuals with autism. Some of these stereotyped behaviors, such as an insistence on sameness and circumscribed interests, may result from imbalances in the cognitive and emotional circuits that iSTART models. These behaviors may be ameliorated by operant conditioning methods. Other stereotyped behaviors, such as repetitive motor behaviors, may result from imbalances in how the direct and indirect pathways of the basal ganglia open or close movement gates, respectively. These repetitive behaviors may be ameliorated by drugs that augment D2 dopamine receptor responses or reduce D1 dopamine receptor responses. The article also notes the ubiquitous role of gating by basal ganglia loops in regulating all the functions that iSTART models.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Concordance between physiological arousal and emotion expression during fear in young children with autism spectrum disorders.This study aimed to measure emotional expression and physiological arousal in response to fear in 21 children with autism spectrum disorders (43-75 months) and 45 typically developing children (41-81 months). Expressions of facial and bodily fear and heart rate arousal were simultaneously measured in response to a remote controlled robot (Laboratory Temperament Assessment Battery). Heart rate analyses revealed a main effect of task from baseline to fear ( p < 0.001, [Formula: see text]), no interaction effect and no effect for group. In addition, children with autism spectrum disorder showed intact facial and bodily expressions of fearful affect compared to typically developing children. With regard to the relationship between expression and arousal, the results provided evidence for concordance between expression and arousal in typically developing children ( r = 0.45, n = 45, p < 0.01). For children with autism spectrum disorder, no significant correlation was found ( r = 0.20, n = 21, p = 0.38). A moderation analysis revealed no significant interaction between expression and arousal for children with and without autism spectrum disorder ( F(1, 62) = 1.23, p = 0.27, [Formula: see text]), which might be the result of limited power. The current results give reason to further study concordance between expression and arousal in early autism spectrum disorder. Discordance might significantly impact social functioning and is an important topic in light of both early identification and treatment.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Scoping the evidence for EarlyBird and EarlyBird Plus, two United Kingdom-developed parent education training programmes for autism spectrum disorder.EarlyBird and EarlyBird Plus are parent education and training programmes designed by the UK National Autistic Society in 1997 and 2003, having been delivered to more than 27,000 families in 14 countries. These group-based programmes aim to (1) support parents immediately after diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, (2) empower parents, encouraging a positive perception of their child's autism spectrum disorder and (3) help parents establish good practice. In the absence of any previous comprehensive review, we performed a scoping review of all peer-reviewed publications on EarlyBird/EarlyBird Plus. A search was conducted between February and June 2016 using EbscoHost, Sabinet, SAGE Journals, Directory of Open Access Journals, BioMed Central, Scopus, ScienceDirect and grey literature. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion. In total, 18 articles were identified: 16 from the United Kingdom and 2 from New Zealand. We reviewed the context, study populations, design, outcome measures, whether focus was on parental perception, parental change or child changes and programme feasibility. Strong parental support for the acceptability but lower level evidence of efficacy of EarlyBird/EarlyBird Plus was found. Future research should consider randomised controlled trials. There is no research on EarlyBird/EarlyBird Plus in low-resource settings; therefore, we recommend broader feasibility evaluation of EarlyBird/EarlyBird Plus including accessibility, cultural appropriateness and scalability.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Chinese children with autism: A multiple chemical elements profile in erythrocytes.Several lines of evidence suggested that abnormal levels of certain chemical elements may contribute to the development of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The present work aimed to investigate the multiple chemical elements profile in the erythrocytes of autistic versus typically developing children (TDC) of China. Analyses were carried out to explore the possible association between levels of elements and the risk as well as the severity of ASD. Erythrocyte levels of 11 elements (32%) among 34 detected elements in autistic group were significantly different from those in the TDC group. To our knowledge, this is the first study which compared the levels of rare earth elements in erythrocytes between children with or without ASD. Five elements including Pb, Na, Ca, Sb, and La are associated with the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) total score. Also, a series of tendencies were found in this research which was believed to affect auditory response, taste, smell, and touch, as well as fear or nervousness. It can be concluded that Chinese autistic children suffer from multi-chemical element imbalances which involves a complex combination of genetic and environmental factors. The results showed a significant correlation between abnormal levels of several chemical elements and the severity of the autistic syndrome.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Translation-relevant EEG phenotypes in a mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome.Identification of comparable biomarkers in humans and validated animal models will facilitate pre-clinical to clinical therapeutic pipelines to treat neurodevelopmental disorders. Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a leading known genetic cause of intellectual disability with symptoms that include increased anxiety, social and sensory processing deficits. Recent EEG studies in humans with FXS have identified neural oscillation deficits that include enhanced resting state gamma power and reduced inter-trial coherence of sound evoked gamma oscillations. To determine if analogous phenotypes are present in an animal model of FXS, we recorded EEGs in awake, freely moving Fmr1 knock out (KO) mice using similar stimuli as in the human studies. We report remarkably similar neural oscillation phenotypes in the Fmr1 KO mouse including enhanced resting state gamma power and reduced evoked gamma synchronization. The gamma band inter-trial coherence of neural response was reduced in both auditory and frontal cortex of Fmr1 KO mice stimulated with a sound whose envelope was modulated from 1 to 100 Hz, similar to that seen in humans with FXS. These deficits suggest a form of enhanced 'resting state noise' that interferes with the ability of the circuit to mount a synchronized response to sensory input, predicting specific sensory and cognitive deficits in FXS. The abnormal gamma oscillations are consistent with parvalbumin neuron and perineuronal net deficits seen in the Fmr1 KO mouse auditory cortex indicating that the EEG biomarkers are not only clinically relevant, but could also be used to probe cellular and circuit mechanisms of sensory hypersensitivity in FXS.\n",

In addition to the social communication skill deficits and restrictive repetitive behaviors and interests, many individuals with ASD engage in challenging behavior. Challenging behavior is associated with a multitude of negative outcomes. Challenging behavior may cause harm to the individual with ASD as well as limit opportunities for educational, vocational, and social participation and development. In addition, caregivers experience high stress and low quality of mental health. As a result, challenging behavior warrants intervention that is specifically tailored to the unique characteristics of individuals with ASD. The purpose of this Special Issue is to showcase recent research in the treatment of challenging behavior for individuals with ASD. This two-part Special Issue contains 12 studies that range from systematic and quality reviews of the intervention literature, to innovative treatment approaches, to studies that develop and evaluate treatments for restrictive and repetitive behaviors and interests.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Using Pattern Classification to Identify Brain Imaging Markers in Autism Spectrum Disorder.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by deficits in social interaction and communication, as well as repetitive and restrictive behaviours. The etiological and phenotypic complexity of ASD has so far hindered the development of clinically useful biomarkers for the condition. Neuroimaging studies have been valuable in establishing a biological basis for ASD. Increasingly, neuroimaging has been combined with 'machine learning'-based pattern classification methods to make individual diagnostic predictions. Moving forward, the hope is that these techniques may not only facilitate the diagnostic process but may also aid in fractionating the ASD phenotype into more biologically homogeneous sub-groups, with defined pathophysiology, predictable outcomes and/or responses to targeted treatments and/or interventions. This review chapter will first introduce 'machine learning' and pattern recognition methods in general, with a focus on their application to diagnostic classification. It will highlight why such approaches to biomarker discovery may have advantages over more conventional analytical methods. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of atypical brain structure, function and connectivity in ASD will be briefly reviewed before we describe how pattern recognition has been applied to generate predictive models for ASD. Last, we will discuss some limitations and pitfalls of pattern recognition analyses in ASD and consider how the field can advance beyond the prediction of binary outcomes.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Gaussian process uncertainty in age estimation as a measure of brain abnormality.Multivariate regression models for age estimation are a powerful tool for assessing abnormal brain morphology associated to neuropathology. Age prediction models are built on cohorts of healthy subjects and are built to reflect normal aging patterns. The application of these multivariate models to diseased subjects usually results in high prediction errors, under the hypothesis that neuropathology presents a similar degenerative pattern as that of accelerated aging. In this work, we propose an alternative to the idea that pathology follows a similar trajectory than normal aging. Instead, we propose the use of metrics which measure deviations from the mean aging trajectory. We propose to measure these deviations using two different metrics: uncertainty in a Gaussian process regression model and a newly proposed age weighted uncertainty measure. Consequently, our approach assumes that pathologic brain patterns are different to those of normal aging. We present results for subjects with autism, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease to highlight the versatility of the approach to different diseases and age ranges. We evaluate volume, thickness, and VBM features for quantifying brain morphology. Our evaluations are performed on a large number of images obtained from a variety of publicly available neuroimaging databases. Across all features, our uncertainty based measurements yield a better separation between diseased subjects and healthy individuals than the prediction error. Finally, we illustrate differences in the disease pattern to normal aging, supporting the application of uncertainty as a measure of neuropathology.\n",

As a direct test of this central hypothesis, we used electroencephalography to investigate whether local prediction error processing was less modulated by global context (i.e., global stimulus frequency) in ASD.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Altered structural brain connectivity involving the dorsal and ventral language pathways in 16p11.2 deletion syndrome.Copy number variants at the chromosomal locus 16p11.2 contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders, epilepsy, schizophrenia, and language and articulation disorders. Here, we provide detailed findings on the disrupted structural brain connectivity in 16p11.2 deletion syndrome (patients: N = 21, age range: 8-16 years; typically developing (TD) controls: 18, 9-16 years) using structural and diffusion MRI. We performed global short-, middle-, long-range, and interhemispheric connectivity analysis in the whole brain using gyral topology-based cortical parcellation. Using region of interest analysis, we studied bilateral dorsal (3 segments of arcuate fasciculus (AF)) and ventral (inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), uncinate fasciculus (UF)) language pathways. Our results showed significantly increased axial (AD) and radial (RD) diffusivities in bilateral anterior AF, decreased volume for left long AF, increased mean diffusivity (MD) and RD for right long AF, and increased AD for bilateral UF in the 16p11.2 deletion group in the absence of significant abnormalities in the whole-brain gyral and interhemispheric connectivity. The selective involvement of the language networks may aid in understanding effects of altered white matter connectivity on neurodevelopmental outcomes in 16p11.2 deletion.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Fluctuations in clinical symptoms with changes in serum 25(OH) vitamin D levels in autistic children: Three cases report.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder caused by complicated interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Clinical trials, including case reports, case-control studies, and a double-blinded randomized clinical study, have suggested that high-dose vitamin D3 regimens may ameliorate the core symptoms of ASD. Vitamin D3 supplementation was effective in about three-quarters of children with ASD. To further investigate the relationship between vitamin D and ASD symptoms in vitamin D-responsive autistic children, changes in symptoms were assessed in three children with ASD who were given vitamin D3 supplementation followed by a long interruption. The core symptoms of ASD were remarkably improved during the vitamin D3 supplementation period when serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)]D levels reached over 40.0 ng/mL. However, symptoms reappeared after the supplementation was stopped, when serum 25(OH)D levels fell below 30.0 ng/mL but were again improved with re-administration of vitamin D3 after the interruption, when serum 25(OH)D levels exceeded 40.0 ng/mL. Overall, these results showed that the core symptoms of ASD fluctuated in severity with changes in serum 25(OH)D levels in children, indicating that maintaining a responsive 25(OH)D level is important for treating ASD. Maintaining a serum 25(OH)D level between 40.0 and 100.0 ng/ml may be optimal for producing therapeutic effects in vitamin D-responsive individuals with ASD.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Selective Pragmatic Impairment in Autism Spectrum Disorder: Indirect Requests Versus Irony.Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is often described as being characterised by a uniform pragmatic impairment. However, recent evidence suggests that some areas of pragmatic functioning are preserved. This study seeks to determine to which extent context-based derivation of non-linguistically encoded meaning is functional in ASD. We compare the performance of 24 adults with ASD, and matched neuro-typical adults in two act-out pragmatic tasks. The first task examines generation of indirect request interpretations, and the second the comprehension of irony. Intact contextual comprehension of indirect requests contrasts with marked difficulties in understanding irony. These results suggest that preserved pragmatics in ASD is limited to egocentric processing of context, which does not rely on assumptions about the speaker's mental states.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The prevalence of autistic traits in a homeless population.Anecdotal evidence suggests that autistic people experience an elevated risk of homelessness, but systematic empirical research on this topic is lacking. As a step towards filling this gap in knowledge, we conducted a preliminary investigation of the prevalence of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.) autism symptoms in a group of long-term homeless people. The entire caseload ( N = 106) of a UK homeless outreach team was screened (excluding individuals born outside of the United Kingdom or Republic of Ireland) using an in-depth, semi-structured interview with keyworkers, based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.) diagnostic criteria. This showed adequate inter-rater reliability, as well as evidence of criterion and construct validity. Of the sample, 13 people (12.3%, 95% confidence interval (7.0, 20.4)) screened positive, meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.) autism criteria by keyworker report. A further nine people (8.5%, 95% confidence interval (4.5, 15.3)) were 'marginal', having autistic traits that were not quite sufficient to meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.) criteria. Those with elevated autistic traits, compared to those without, tended to be more socially isolated and less likely to use substances. This study has provided initial evidence that autistic traits are over-represented among homeless people and that autistic homeless people may show a distinct pattern of characteristics and needs. Further investigation is required to build upon these provisional findings.\n",

As part of an ongoing effort to pool data and learn from shared experience, we collected information across all studies about innovation components and implementation strategies. First, each study group completed standardized checklists based on the Template for Intervention Description and Replication and the Expert Recommendation for Implementing Change. Then, we interviewed principal and co-investigators of each study (n = 9) to further explore innovation components and assess barriers and facilitators to implementation. Innovation strategies were diverse (five different autism spectrum disorder screeners were used, 40% included early intervention trainings, 60% involved new technology). Common implementation strategies included developing stakeholder relationships and provider trainings. Barriers included inefficient systems of care, difficulty engaging families in the innovations, provider attitudes, and organizational culture (e.g. difficulty changing clinic processes). These findings suggest that-despite diverse settings and a variety of innovation content-common facilitators and challenges exist in implementing innovations to enhance access to early autism spectrum disorder screening, diagnosis, and treatment.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Therapeutic use of carbohydrate-restricted diets in an autistic child; a case report of clinical and 18FDG PET findings.The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, adequate-protein, and low-carbohydrate diet that has been used successfully in the treatment of refractory epilepsies for almost 100 years. There has been accumulating evidence to show that the KD may provide a therapeutic benefit in autism spectrum disorders, albeit by a yet-unknown mechanism. We report a case of a 6-year-old patient with high-functioning autism and subclinical epileptic discharges who responded poorly to several behavioural and psychopharmacological treatments. The patient was subsequently placed on the KD due to significant glucose hypometabolism in the brain as revealed by an 18FDG PET. As soon as one month after starting the KD, the patient's behavior and intellect improved (in regard to hyperactivity, attention span, abnormal reactions to visual and auditory stimuli, usage of objects, adaptability to changes, communication skills, fear, anxiety, and emotional reactions); these improvements continued until the end of the observation period at 16 months on the KD. The 18FDG PET, measured at 12 months on the KD, revealed that 18F-FDG uptake decreased markedly and diffusely in the whole cerebral cortex with a relatively low reduction in basal ganglia in comparison to the pre-KD assessment. It warrants further investigation if the 18FDG PET imaging could serve as a biomarker in identifying individuals with autism who might benefit from the KD due to underlying abnormalities related to glucose hypometabolism.\n",

ASD would rather adopt a lookup-table strategy (LUT: memorizing each experience), while neurotypics would favor an interpolation style (INT: extracting regularities to generalize). In a series of visual behavioral tasks, we tested this hypothesis in 20 neurotypical and 20 ASD adults. ASD participants had difficulties using the INT style when instructions were hidden but not when instructions were revealed. Rather than an inability to use rules, ASD would be characterized by a disinclination to generalize and infer such rules.\n",

At present only two patients with 11q13.1 deletion involving neurexin 2 (NRXN2) have been reported. Both patients exhibited autistic features, which supported the role of NRXN2 in autism pathogenicity. It is currently unknown whether heterozygous deletion of NRXN2 is of high penetrance or if it is sufficient to result in autism behaviors. Here we reported a 2-year-9-month old boy with developmental delay, short stature, significant language delay and other congenital anomalies. In contrast to previously reported cases, the boy did not present with autistic behaviors and did not meet the clinical diagnosis of autism. A de novo 921 kb microdeletion at 11q13.1 was detected by chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA). Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) was also employed for our patient. The deletion was confirmed and no additional pathogenic variants were detected. We compared our patient's genomic information and clinical features with those of two previously reported individuals. Three patients shared similar deleted intervals and had similar clinical features except for autistic behaviors. This study suggested that NRXN2 gene had incomplete penetrance for autistic behavioral phenotype. The finding is of interest for genetic counseling and clinical management to patients with NRXN2 defects.\n",

      "ABSTRACT No effect of prenatal vitamin D deficiency on autism-relevant behaviours in multiple inbred strains of mice.Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) is a group of neurodevelopmental disorders commonly characterised by verbal and non-verbal communication deficits, impaired social interaction and repetitive, stereotypic behaviours. The aetiology of ASD is most likely a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Epidemiological evidence suggests that prenatal vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased incidence of ASD. The overall aim of this study was to investigate prenatal vitamin D deficiency on ASD-related behavioural phenotypes in multiple inbred strains of mice. We included two commonly used inbred mouse strains (C57BL/6J and BALB/c) as well as inbred BTBR mice, which show ASD-related behaviours, such as excessive self-grooming, hyperlocomotion, social interaction deficits and altered communication. We also studied the effect of prenatal vitamin D deficiency in a fourth strain; an F1 cross of C57BL/6J x BTBR mice, which have a partial BTBR phenotype. To implement prenatal vitamin D deficiency, female mice were placed on vitamin D deplete diets for ten weeks, including mating and gestation, until littering, when all dams were switched to the control diet. Behavioural symptoms related to ASD were measured, including isolation-induced ultrasonic vocalisations to measure communication, the three-chambered social interaction task to observe social interaction, the open field test to examine hyperlocomotion, assessment of grooming and rearing behaviour and finally the active place avoidance task to observe spatial learning and memory in response to a mild foot shock. Prenatal vitamin D deficiency had a negative impact on preference for social novelty in C57BL/6J mice, despite similar vocalisation phenotypes, and prenatal vitamin D-deficient F1 mice were found to be hypolocomotive in the open field test yet performed better on the active place avoidance task. Despite clear differences between strains, there were no other consistent significant main effects of maternal diet on the behaviour of the offspring. Vitamin D deficiency has been implicated as a risk factor for ASD and these data show that there is greater variation between different inbred strains in ASD-related behaviour, suggesting that prenatal vitamin D deficiency is not sufficient to recapitulate an ASD phenotype in multiple inbred strains of mice.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Truncating Variants in NAA15 Are Associated with Variable Levels of Intellectual Disability, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and Congenital Anomalies.N-alpha-acetylation is a common co-translational protein modification that is essential for normal cell function in humans. We previously identified the genetic basis of an X-linked infantile lethal Mendelian disorder involving a c.109T>C (p.Ser37Pro) missense variant in NAA10, which encodes the catalytic subunit of the N-terminal acetyltransferase A (NatA) complex. The auxiliary subunit of the NatA complex, NAA15, is the dimeric binding partner for NAA10. Through a genotype-first approach with whole-exome or genome sequencing (WES/WGS) and targeted sequencing analysis, we identified and phenotypically characterized 38 individuals from 33 unrelated families with 25 different de novo or inherited, dominantly acting likely gene disrupting (LGD) variants in NAA15. Clinical features of affected individuals with LGD variants in NAA15 include variable levels of intellectual disability, delayed speech and motor milestones, and autism spectrum disorder. Additionally, mild craniofacial dysmorphology, congenital cardiac anomalies, and seizures are present in some subjects. RNA analysis in cell lines from two individuals showed degradation of the transcripts with LGD variants, probably as a result of nonsense-mediated decay. Functional assays in yeast confirmed a deleterious effect for two of the LGD variants in NAA15. Further supporting a mechanism of haploinsufficiency, individuals with copy-number variant (CNV) deletions involving NAA15 and surrounding genes can present with mild intellectual disability, mild dysmorphic features, motor delays, and decreased growth. We propose that defects in NatA-mediated N-terminal acetylation (NTA) lead to variable levels of neurodevelopmental disorders in humans, supporting the importance of the NatA complex in normal human development.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Polygenic risk for psychiatric disorders correlates with executive function in typical development.Executive functions are a diverse and critical suite of cognitive abilities that are often disrupted in individuals with psychiatric disorders. Despite their moderate to high heritability, little is known about the molecular genetic factors that contribute to variability in executive functions and how these factors may be related to those that predispose to psychiatric disorders. We examined the relationship between polygenic risk scores built from large genome-wide association studies of psychiatric disorders and executive functioning in typically developing children. In our discovery sample (N = 417), consistent with previous reports on general cognitive abilities, polygenic risk for autism spectrum disorder was associated with better performance on the Dimensional Change Card Sort test from the NIH Cognition Toolbox, with the largest effect in the youngest children. Polygenic risk for major depressive disorder was associated with poorer performance on the Flanker test in the same sample. This second association replicated for performance on the Penn Conditional Exclusion Test in an independent cohort (N = 3681). Our results suggest that the molecular genetic factors contributing to variability in executive function during typical development are at least partially overlapping with those associated with psychiatric disorders, although larger studies and further replication are needed.\n",

      "ABSTRACT RDoC-based categorization of amygdala functions and its implications in autism.Confusion endures as to the exact role of the amygdala in relation to autism. To help resolve this we turned to the NIMH's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) which provides a classification schema that identifies different categories of behaviors that can turn pathologic in mental health disorders, e.g. autism. While RDoC incorporates all the known neurobiological substrates for each domain, this review will focus primarily on the amygdala. We first consider the amygdala from an anatomical, historical, and developmental perspective. Next, we examine the different domains and constructs of RDoC that the amygdala is involved in: Negative Valence Systems, Positive Valence Systems, Cognitive Systems, Social Processes, and Arousal and Regulatory Systems. Then the evidence for a dysfunctional amygdala in autism is presented with a focus on alterations in development, prenatal valproic acid exposure as a model for ASD, and changes in the oxytocin system therein. Finally, a synthesis of RDoC, the amygdala, and autism is offered, emphasizing the task of disambiguation and suggestions for future research.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Ethopathology and Civilization Diseases: Niko and Elisabeth Tinbergen on Autism.The idea that some diseases result from a poor fit between modern life and our biological make-up is part of the long history of what historian of medicine Charles Rosenberg has called the \"progress-and-pathology narrative.\" This article examines a key episode in that history: 1973 Nobel laureate Niko Tinbergen's use of an evolutionary framework to identify autism as a pathogenic effect of progress. Influenced by British psychiatrist John Bowlby's work, Tinbergen and his wife Elisabeth saw autistic children as victims of environmental stress caused mainly by mothers' failure to bond with their children and to protect them from conflicting situations. However, the author argues that their position was not \"environmental.\" For them, autism was due to a failure of socialization but the mechanisms that explain that failure were established by biological evolution. Situating their views within the context of Niko's concern about the derailment of biological evolution by cultural evolution, this article shows that their ideas are of special significance for understanding the persistence of the view that civilization poses a risk to human health.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Similarities and differences between infantile and early childhood onset vanishing white matter disease.Vanishing white matter disease (VWM) is one of the most prevalent inherited leukoencephalopathies in childhood. Infantile VWM is more severe but less understood than the classic early childhood type. We performed a follow-up study on 14 infantile and 26 childhood patients to delineate the natural history and neuroimaging features of VWM. Infantile and childhood patients shared similarities in the incidence of epileptic seizure (35.7 vs. 38.5%) and episodic aggravation (92.9 vs. 84.6%). Developmental delay before disease onset was more common in infantile patients. Motor disability was earlier and more severe in infantile VWM. In survivors with disease durations of 1-3 years, the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) was classified as IV-V in 66.7% of infantile and only 29.4% of childhood patients. Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis indicated that the 5-year survival rates were 21.6 and 91.3% in infantile and childhood VWM, respectively. In terms of MRI, infantile patients showed more extensive involvement and earlier rarefaction, with more common involvement of subcortical white matter, internal capsule, brain stem and dentate nuclei of the cerebellum. Restricted diffusion was more diffuse or extensive in infantile patients. In addition, four novel mutations were identified. In conclusion, we identified some similarities and differences in the natural history and neuroimaging features between infantile and early childhood VWM.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Dynamics and structural stability effects of germline PTEN mutations associated with cancer versus autism phenotypes.Individuals with germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), irrespective of clinical presentation, are diagnosed with PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS). PHTS confers a high risk of breast, thyroid, and other cancers or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with macrocephaly. It remains unclear why mutations in one gene can lead to seemingly disparate phenotypes. Thus, we sought to identify differences in ASD vs. cancer-associated germline PTEN missense mutations by investigating putative structural effects induced by each mutation. We utilized a theoretical computational approach combining in silico structural analysis and molecular dynamics (MD) to interrogate 17 selected mutations from our patient population: six mutations were observed in patients with ASD (only), six mutations in patients with PHTS-associated cancer (only), four mutations shared across both phenotypes, and one mutation with both ASD and cancer. We demonstrate structural stability changes where all six cancer-associated mutations showed a global decrease in structural stability and increased dynamics across the domain interface with a proclivity to unfold, mediating a closed (inactive) active site. In contrast, five of the six ASD-associated mutations showed localized destabilization that contribute to the partial opening of the active site. Our results lend insight into distinctive structural effects of germline PTEN mutations associated with PTEN-ASD vs. those associated with PTEN-cancer, potentially aiding in identification of the shared and separate molecular features that contribute to autism or cancer, thus, providing a deeper understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships for germline PTEN mutations.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Leo Kanner and autism: a 75-year perspective.In 1943, Leo Kanner published the first systematic description of early infantile autism. He concluded that this was a neurodevelopmental disorder and that 'these children have come into the world with an innate inability to form the usual, biologically provided contact with people'. Moreover, his astute descriptions of parental behavior in his first publications were prescient and underlie later recognition of the importance of genetics. Our understanding has grown over the ensuing years with revisions in diagnostic classification, recognition of the broader autism phenotype in families, appreciation of the importance of developmental models, advances in genetic methodology, better understanding of the relationship to intellectual deficits, recognition of syndromic autism in neurogenetic sydromes, advances in neuroimaging, and advances in animal models, both mutant mouse models and transgenic non human primate models. Kanner recognized diagnostic heterogeneity and opined that the children had not read those diagnostic manuals and did not easily fall into clear cut categories. Such heterogeneity continues to confound our diagnostic efforts. Always an advocate for children, when reviewing the DSM III criteria in 1980, Kanner emphasized that no matter how well developed our criteria each child must be treated as a unique person.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Metacognitive monitoring and the hypercorrection effect in autism and the general population: Relation to autism(-like) traits and mindreading.Among neurotypical adults, errors made with high confidence (i.e. errors a person strongly believed they would not make) are corrected more reliably than errors made with low confidence. This 'hypercorrection effect' is thought to result from enhanced attention to information that reflects a 'metacognitive mismatch' between one's beliefs and reality. In Experiment 1, we employed a standard measure of this effect. Participants answered general knowledge questions and provided confidence judgements about how likely each answer was to be correct, after which feedback was given. Finally, participants were retested on all questions answered incorrectly during the initial phase. Mindreading ability and autism spectrum disorder-like traits were measured. We found that a representative sample of ( n = 83) neurotypical participants made accurate confidence judgements (reflecting good metacognition) and showed the hypercorrection effect. Mindreading ability was associated with autism spectrum disorder-like traits and metacognition. However, the hypercorrection effect was non-significantly associated with mindreading or autism spectrum disorder-like traits. In Experiment 2, 11 children with autism spectrum disorder and 11 matched comparison participants completed the hypercorrection task. Although autism spectrum disorder children showed significantly diminished metacognitive ability, they showed an undiminished hypercorrection effect. The evidence in favour of an undiminished hypercorrection effect (null result) was moderate, according to Bayesian analysis (Bayes factor = 0.21).\n",

      "ABSTRACT 2016 Children's Tumor Foundation conference on neurofibromatosis type 1, neurofibromatosis type 2, and schwannomatosis.Organized and hosted by the Children's Tumor Foundation (CTF), the Neurofibromatosis (NF) conference is the premier annual gathering for clinicians and researchers interested in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), and schwannomatosis (SWN). The 2016 edition constituted a blend of clinical and basic aspects of NF research that helped in clarifying different advances in the field. The incorporation of next generation sequencing is changing the way genetic diagnostics is performed for NF and related disorders, providing solutions to problems like genetic heterogeneity, overlapping clinical manifestations, or the presence of mosaicism. The transformation from plexiform neurofibroma (PNF) to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is being clarified, along with new management and treatments for benign and premalignant tumors. Promising new cellular and in vivo models for understanding the musculoskeletal abnormalities in NF1, the development of NF2 or SWN associated schwannomas, and clarifying the cells that give rise to NF1-associated optic pathway glioma were presented. The interaction of neurofibromin and SPRED1 was described comprehensively, providing functional insight that will help in the interpretation of pathogenicity of certain missense variants identified in NF1 and Legius syndrome patients. Novel promising imaging techniques are being developed, as well as new integrative and holistic management models for patients that take into account psychological, social, and biological factors. Importantly, new therapeutic approaches for schwannomas, meningiomas, ependymomas, PNF, and MPNST are being pursued. This report highlights the major advances that were presented at the 2016 CTF NF conference.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Co-occurring psychiatric conditions in autism spectrum disorder.Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at increased risk for experiencing one or more co-occurring psychiatric conditions. When present, these conditions are associated with additional impairment and distress. It is therefore crucial that clinicians and researchers adequately understand and address these challenges. However, due to symptom overlap, diagnostic overshadowing, and ambiguous symptom presentation in ASD, the assessment of co-occurring conditions in ASD is complex and challenging. Likewise, individual difference factors, such as age, intellectual functioning, and gender, may influence the presentation of co-occurring symptoms. Relatedly, a transdiagnostic framework may offer utility in assessing and treating co-occurring conditions. However, with the exception of anxiety disorders, treatment research for co-occurring psychiatric conditions in ASD is relatively limited. Therefore, the present paper aims to summarize and review available research on the most common co-occurring psychiatric disorders in ASD, with a focus on estimated population-based prevalence rates, diagnostic challenges, the influence of individual differences, and assessment guidelines. The utility of a transdiagnostic framework for conceptualizing co-occurring disorders in ASD is discussed, and the state of treatment research for co-occurring disorders is summarized. This study concludes with a summary of the extant literature, as well as recommendations for future research.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Why is vitamin B6 effective in alleviating the symptoms of autism?Many factors are reported to be involved in the complex pathophysiological processes of autism, suggesting that there is considerable variability in the manifestations of this disease. Several interventions are used to treat this disorder. Among them, vitamin B6 is widely used to treat the symptoms observed in autism. Vitamin B6 is beneficial for about half of autistic individuals in decreasing behavioral problems. However, until now, it remains unknown why vitamin B6 is effective for this disease. Although the exact pathogenesis is not defined, it is evident that certain neurotransmitter systems are impaired in the brains of autistic patients, causing the symptoms observed in the disease. In fact, impairment of many neurotransmitter systems has been reported, including GABA, serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenalin. Furthermore, vitamin B6 is important for the synthesis of many neurotransmitters, including GABA, serotonin, dopamine, noradrenalin, histamine, glycine, and d-serine, indicating that vitamin B6 supplementation may enhance many neurotransmitter systems. Thus, vitamin B6 supplementation can treat the impaired neurotransmitter systems in a given patient, even if the actual impaired neurotransmitter systems are not defined in that patient.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Designing a model to detect the brain connections abnormalities in children with autism using 3D-cellular neural networks.In neuropsychological disorders, the significant abnormalities in the brain connections in some regions are observed. This paper presents a novel model to demonstrate the connections between different regions in children with autism. The proposed model first conducts the wavelet decomposition of electroencephalography signals by wavelet transform then the features are extracted, such as relative energy and entropy. These features are fed to the 3D-cellular neural network model as inputs to indicate the brain connections. The results showed that there are significant differences and abnormalities in the left hemisphere, (p<0.05) at the electrodes AF3, F3, P7, T7 and O1 in alpha band, AF3, F7, T7 and O1 in beta band, T7 and P7 in gamma band for children with autism compared with the control children. Also, the evaluation of the obtained connections values between brain regions indicated that there are more abnormalities in the connectivity of frontal and parietal lobes and the relations of the neighboring regions in all three bands especially in gamma band for autistic children. Evaluation of the analysis demonstrated that alpha frequency band had the best distinction level of 96.6% based on the obtained values of the cellular neural network using support vector machine method.\n",

There is a wide range of experimental studies showing that low maternal thyroid hormone availability is associated with suboptimal brain development parameters. While few clinical studies have shown that overt maternal hypothyroidism is associated with lower child IQ, the question whether more subclinical changes in maternal thyroid function could also lead to suboptimal foetal brain development. In this review, we put the latter studies in perspective and discuss their interpretation from an epidemiological and clinical perspective. Furthermore, we extend this discussion to also include future perspective and identify important knowledge gaps in the field.\n",

Correlations between parent and teacher ratings were moderate and significant for social skills (r = 0.20-0.37) but near zero for behavioral concerns. Parents rated children as having stronger social skills and fewer behavioral concerns than teachers, unlike prior research with typically developing preschoolers.

      "ABSTRACT Cluster analysis reveals subclinical subgroups with shared autistic and schizotypal traits.Autism and schizophrenia spectrum research is typically based on coarse diagnostic classification, which overlooks individual variation within clinical groups. This method limits the identification of underlying cognitive, genetic and neural correlates of specific symptom dimensions. This study, therefore, aimed to identify homogenous subclinical subgroups of specific autistic and schizotypal traits dimensions, that may be utilised to establish more effective diagnostic and treatment practices. Latent profile analysis of subscale scores derived from an autism-schizotypy questionnaire, completed by 1678 subclinical adults aged 18-40 years (1250 females), identified a local optimum of eight population clusters: High, Moderate and Low Psychosocial Difficulties; High, Moderate and Low Autism-Schizotypy; High Psychosis-Proneness; and Moderate Schizotypy. These subgroups represent the convergent and discriminant dimensions of autism and schizotypy in the subclinical population, and highlight the importance of examining subgroups of specific symptom characteristics across these spectra in order to identify the underlying genetic and neural correlates that can be utilised to advance diagnostic and treatment practices.\n",

Diagnosing psychosis in such individuals can be challenging when they present with symptoms at a young age. A careful history and thorough assessment are essential for proper diagnosis to avoid mislabeling certain behavioral problems encountered among children with ASD. We present the case of a 12-year-old child with atypical autism who developed psychotic symptoms that led to a diagnostic dilemma.

      "ABSTRACT Pragmatic failure, mind style and characterisation in fiction about autism.This article presents an analysis of different types of pragmatic failure in the interactional behaviour of the 'autistic' protagonists of three recent novels. Three main types of pragmatic failure occur across all three novels: problems with informativeness and relevance in conversational contributions; problems with face management resulting in unintentional impolite behaviours; and problems with the interpretation of figurative language. These problems are salient and frequent enough to contribute to the projection of distinctive mind styles, and more generally to the characterisation of the protagonists as individuals with communication and socialisation difficulties that are likely to both reflect and reinforce general perceptions of autism-spectrum disorders. It is also argued that pragmatic failure contributes to the potential defamiliarisation of 'normal' communication, which is presented as being fraught with obscurity, ambiguity and insincerity.\n",

In 1944, Asperger published a comprehensive study on the topic (submitted to Vienna University in 1942 as his postdoctoral thesis), which would only find international acknowledgement in the 1980s. From then on, the eponym 'Asperger's syndrome' increasingly gained currency in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the conceptualization of the condition. At the time, the fact that Asperger had spent pivotal years of his career in Nazi Vienna caused some controversy regarding his potential ties to National Socialism and its race hygiene policies. Documentary evidence was scarce, however, and over time a narrative of Asperger as an active opponent of National Socialism took hold. The main goal of this paper is to re-evaluate this narrative, which is based to a large extent on statements made by Asperger himself and on a small segment of his published work.\n",

It was developed to enhance early identification of autism spectrum disorder in low literacy groups. The Developmental Check-In was tested in a sample of 376 children between the ages of 24 and 60 months, from underserved communities. It showed good ability to discriminate autism spectrum disorder from non-autism spectrum disorder (area-under-the-curve = 0.75) across the full age range represented in the sample. Twenty-six of the 28 Developmental Check-In items predicted the presence of autism spectrum disorder.

      "ABSTRACT Information, education, and health behaviors: Evidence from the MMR vaccine autism controversy.In the wake of strong, although later refuted, claims of a link between autism and the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, I examine whether fewer parents immunized or delayed vaccinations for their children and if there was a differential response by mother's education level. Using various controls and a differencing strategy that compares in MMR take-up with other vaccines, I find that the MMR-autism controversy led to a decline in the immediate years and that there were negative spillovers onto other vaccines. I also find evidence that more highly educated mothers responded more strongly to the controversy either by not immunizing their children altogether or, to a lesser degree, delaying vaccination. Moreover, the educational gap was greater in states where there was greater media attention devoted to the controversy. This is consistent with the health allocative efficiency hypothesis whereby part of the education gradient in health outcomes is due to more-educated individuals absorbing and responding to health information more quickly. However, unlike in the United Kingdom, where previous studies find that the gap was eliminated after the link was refuted, the evidence for the United States suggests that the educational gap persisted.\n",

Although this condition is very common, no one has reported a case as young as our patients. We present a 7-month infant with bilateral paralysis of the lower limbs for four (4) months with no history of trauma. Computer tomographic (CT-scan) imaging revealed alantoaxial dislocation with severe cervical spinal cord compression. The odontoid process is displaced outwardly with no bone destruction. Doppler echocardiogram done revealed patent foramen ovale. Thorough physical examination as well as radiological evaluation revealed no feather malformations. Electrophysio - logical studies reveal normal compound muscle action potentials (CMAP) and sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) in all the limbs. Electromyography (EMG) also revealed normal nerves in the limbs and the trunk. We attained a stable fusion and anatomical reduction using a posterior titanium wire and an iliac bone graft harvested from his mother. This is the youngest patient reported in literature. Infantile alantoaxial dislocation should be managed at early stage to prevent long-term neurologic disorders.\n",

Following their initiation into autism-related social groups, members begin using such concepts as triggers, overload, shutdown, and meltdown to refer to their bodily experiences of distress. They then face the task of investing these ambiguous concepts with meaning, through nurturing an increased awareness to their body's relationship with its material surrounding. This cultivation of sensitivity ultimately culminates in the transformation of their bodies into what might be termed autistic bodies.\n",

The extent to which rewarding social stimuli are granted privileged access to awareness in ASD is currently unknown. We use continuous flash suppression to investigate whether individuals with and without ASD show privileged access to awareness for social over nonsocial rewarding scenes that are closely matched for stimulus features. Strong evidence for a privileged access to awareness for rewarding social over nonsocial scenes was observed in neurotypical adults. No such privileged access was seen in ASD individuals, and moderate support for the null model was noted. These results suggest that the purported deficits in social motivation in ASD may extend to early processing mechanisms.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Neonatal immune activation by lipopolysaccharide causes inadequate emotional responses to novel situations but no changes in anxiety or cognitive behavior in Wistar rats.Infection during the prenatal or neonatal stages of life is considered one of the major risk factors for the development of mental diseases such as schizophrenia or autism. However, the impacts of such an immune challenge on adult behavior are still not clear. In our study, we used a model of early postnatal immune activation by the application of bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to rat pups at a dose of 2 mg/kg from postnatal day (PD) 5 to PD 9. In adulthood, the rats were tested in a battery of tasks probing various aspects of behavior: spontaneous activity (open field test), social behavior (social interactions and female bedding exploration), anxiety (elevated plus maze), cognition (active place avoidance in Carousel) and emotional response (ultrasonic vocalization recording). Moreover, we tested sensitivity to acute challenge with MK-801, a psychotomimetic drug. Our results show that the application of LPS led to increased self-grooming in the female bedding exploration test and inadequate emotional reactions in Carousel maze displayed by ultrasonic vocalizations. However, it did not have serious consequences on exploration, locomotion, social behavior or cognition. Furthermore, exposition to MK-801 did not trigger social or cognitive deficits in the LPS-treated rats. We conclude that the emotional domain is the most sensitive to the changes induced by neonatal immune activation in rats, including a disrupted response to novel and stressful situations in early adulthood (similar to that observed in human patients suffering from schizophrenia or autism), while other aspects of tested behavior remain unaffected.\n",

In this review, we consider the question of how social touch is defined from both bottom-up and top-down perspectives. In the former category, there is a clear role for the C-touch (CT) system, which constitutes a unique submodality that mediates affective touch and contrasts with discriminative touch. Top-down factors such as culture, personal relationships, setting, gender, and other contextual influences are also important in defining and interpreting social touch. The critical role of social touch throughout the lifespan is considered, with special attention to infancy and young childhood, a time during which social touch and its neural, behavioral, and physiological contingencies contribute to reinforcement-based learning and impact a variety of developmental trajectories. Finally, the role of social touch in an example of disordered development -autism spectrum disorder-is reviewed.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Typical use of inverse dynamics in perceiving motion in autistic adults: Exploring computational principles of perception and action.There is increasing evidence for motor difficulties in many people with autism spectrum condition (ASC). These difficulties could be linked to differences in the use of internal models which represent relations between motions and forces/efforts. The use of these internal models may be dependent on the cerebellum which has been shown to be abnormal in autism. Several studies have examined internal computations of forward dynamics (motion from force information) in autism, but few have tested the inverse dynamics computation, that is, the determination of force-related information from motion information. Here, we examined this ability in autistic adults by measuring two perceptual biases which depend on the inverse computation. First, we asked participants whether they experienced a feeling of resistance when moving a delayed cursor, which corresponds to the inertial force of the cursor implied by its motion-both typical and ASC participants reported similar feelings of resistance. Second, participants completed a psychophysical task in which they judged the velocity of a moving hand with or without a visual cue implying inertial force. Both typical and ASC participants perceived the hand moving with the inertial cue to be slower than the hand without it. In both cases, the magnitude of the effects did not differ between the two groups. Our results suggest that the neural systems engaged in the inverse dynamics computation are preserved in ASC, at least in the observed conditions.

With burgeoning waitlists for comprehensive diagnostic ASD assessments, finding accurate methods and tools for advancing diagnostic triage becomes increasingly important. The current study compares the efficacy of four oft used paper and pencil measures, the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers Revised with Follow-up, the Social Responsiveness Scale, Second Edition, and the Social Communication Questionnaire, and the Child Behavior Checklist to a novel mobile-health screening tool developed by Cognoa, Inc. (Cognoa) in a group of children 18-72 months of age. The Cognoa tool may have potential benefits as it integrates a series of parent-report questions with remote clinical ratings of brief video segments uploaded via parent's smartphones to calculate level of ASD risk. Participants were referred to one of three tertiary care diagnostic centers for ASD-related concerns (n = 230) and received a best estimate ASD diagnosis. Analysis and comparison of psychometric properties indicated potential advantages for Cognoa within this clinical sample across age ranges not often covered by another single measure/tool.

      "ABSTRACT Predictors of quality of life for autistic adults.Research with adults on the autism spectrum is as yet limited in scope and quality. The present study describes quality of life (QoL) of a large sample of autistic adults in the UK and investigates characteristics that may be predictive of QoL. A total of 370 autistic adults from the Adult Autism Spectrum Cohort-UK (ASC-UK) completed the WHOQoL-BREF, and the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS, autism symptom severity), along with the ASC-UK registration questionnaire giving information on mental health and their life situation. QoL for autistic adults was lower than for the general population for each WHOQoL domain. Younger participants reported higher QoL than older participants in psychological and environment domains. Males reported higher physical QoL than females, and females reported higher social QoL than males. Significant positive predictors of QoL were: being employed (physical QoL), receiving support (social and environment QoL), and being in a relationship (social QoL). Having a mental health condition and higher SRS total score were negative predictors of QoL across all four domains. Autistic adults require access to effective mental health interventions, and informal and formal support for their social difficulties, to improve their quality of life.

LAY SUMMARY: There has been limited research into the lived experience of autistic adults. Using the World Health Organization quality of life measure, we found that autistic people (370) in the UK reported their quality of life to be lower than that of the general population. Better quality of life was associated with being in a relationship; those with a mental health condition had poorer quality of life. This research suggests some ways in which autistic people can be helped to improve their quality of life.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Neuroimmunology Research. A Report from the Cuban Network of Neuroimmunology.Neuroimmunology can be traced back to the XIX century through the descriptions of some of the disease&rsquo;s models (e.g., multiple sclerosis and Guillain Barret syndrome, amongst others). The diagnostic tools are based in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis developed by Quincke or in the development of neuroimmunotherapy with the earlier expression in Pasteur&rsquo;s vaccine for rabies. Nevertheless, this field, which began to become delineated as an independent research area in the 1940s, has evolved as an innovative and integrative field at the shared edges of neurosciences, immunology, and related clinical and research areas, which are currently becoming a major concern for neuroscience and indeed for all of the scientific community linked to it. The workshop focused on several topics: (1) the molecular mechanisms of immunoregulation in health and neurological diseases, (like multiple sclerosis, autism, ataxias, epilepsy, Alzheimer and Parkinson&rsquo;s disease); (2) the use of animal models for neurodegenerative diseases (ataxia, fronto-temporal dementia/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ataxia-telangiectasia); (3) the results of new interventional technologies in neurology, with a special interest in the implementation of surgical techniques and the management of drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy; (4) the use of non-invasive brain stimulation in neurodevelopmental disorders; as well as (5) the efficacy of neuroprotective molecules in neurodegenerative diseases.

Evidence-based interventions have been developed and demonstrate effectiveness in improving child outcomes. However, research on generalizable methods to scale up these practices in the multiple service systems caring for these children has been limited and is critical to meet this growing public health need. This project includes two, coordinated studies testing the effectiveness of the Translating Evidence-based Interventions (EBI) for ASD: Multi-Level Implementation Strategy (TEAMS) model. TEAMS focuses on improving implementation leadership, organizational climate, and provider attitudes and motivation in order to improve two key implementation outcomes-provider training completion and intervention fidelity and subsequent child outcomes.

      "ABSTRACT Long-term social skills group training for children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder: a randomized controlled trial.Social skills group training (SSGT) is widely used for intellectually able children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Previous studies indicate small to moderate effects on social communication capacities. The duration of most available programs is relatively short, and extended training might lead to further improvement. This randomized controlled trial compared an extended 24-week version of the SSGT program KONTAKT with standard care. The weekly sessions gradually shifted in content from acquisition of new skills to real-world application of the acquired skills. A total of 50 participants with ASD (15 females; 35 males) aged 8-17 years were included. The study was conducted at two child and adolescent psychiatry outpatient units in Sweden. The primary outcome was the Social Responsiveness Scale-Second Edition (SRS-2) rated by parents and blinded teachers. Secondary outcomes included parent- and teacher-rated adaptive behaviors, trainer-rated global functioning and clinical severity, and self-reported child and caregiver stress. Assessments were made at baseline, posttreatment, and at 3-months follow-up. Parent-rated SRS-2 scores indicated large effects posttreatment [- 19.2; 95% CI - 29.9 to - 8.5; p < .001, effect size (ES) = 0.76], which were maintained at follow-up (- 20.7; 95% CI - 31.7 to - 9.7; p < .0001, ES = 0.82). These estimates indicate substantially larger improvement than previously reported for shorter SSGT. However, the effects on teacher-rated SRS-2 and most secondary outcomes did not reach statistical significance. Our results suggest added benefits of extended SSGT training, implying that service providers might reach better results by optimizing the delivery of SSGT.\n",

      "ABSTRACT From aggression to autism: new perspectives on the behavioral sequelae of monoamine oxidase deficiency.The two monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes, A and B, catalyze the metabolism of monoamine neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. The phenotypic outcomes of MAO congenital deficiency have been studied in humans and animal models, to explore the role of these enzymes in behavioral regulation. The clinical condition caused by MAOA deficiency, Brunner syndrome, was first described as a disorder characterized by overt antisocial and aggressive conduct. Building on this discovery, subsequent studies were focused on the characterization of the role of MAOA in the neurobiology of antisocial conduct. MAO A knockout mice were found to display high levels of intermale aggression; however, further analyses of these mutants unveiled additional behavioral abnormalities mimicking the core symptoms of autism-spectrum disorder. These findings were strikingly confirmed in newly reported cases of Brunner syndrome. The role of MAOB in behavioral regulation remains less well-understood, even though Maob-deficient mice have been found to exhibit greater behavioral disinhibition and risk-taking responses, supporting previous clinical studies showing associations between low MAO B activity and impulsivity. Furthermore, lack of MAOB was found to exacerbate the severity of psychopathological deficits induced by concurrent MAOA deficiency. Here, we summarize how the convergence of clinical reports and behavioral phenotyping in mutant mice has helped frame a complex picture of psychopathological features in MAO-deficient individuals, which encompass a broad spectrum of neurodevelopmental problems. This emerging knowledge poses novel conceptual challenges towards the identification of the endophenotypes shared by autism-spectrum disorder, antisocial behavior and impulse-control problems, as well as their monoaminergic underpinnings.\n",

Findings showed that 74% of adults with autism reported interoceptive confusion. Another finding of the study was that as autistic traits increased, interoceptive confusion increased, with adults with diagnosed autism scoring highest on the construct.

Studies have shown an over-representation of ASD symptoms among transgender youth. These studies, however, have used scales that are non-specific for ASD.

      "ABSTRACT Cytoplasmic FMRP interacting protein 1/2 (CYFIP1/2) expression analysis in autism.Cytoplasmic FMRP interacting proteins 1 and 2 (CYFIP1/2) have been previously shown to be associated with central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Moreover, dysregulation of their expression levels results in disturbances in CNS maturation and neuronal interconnections. In the present study, we compared expression levels of CYFIP1/2 in peripheral blood of 30 ASD patients and 41 healthy subjects by means of real time PCR. Expression analysis showed significant over-expression of CYFIP1/2 in ASD patients compared with healthy subjects (Fold change = 3.252, P < 0.0001 and Fold change = 4.14, P = 0.001 respectively). Such over-expression was also seen for CYFIP1 in male and female patients when compared with the corresponding control subjects. In addition, a significant correlation was found between CYFIP1 transcript levels and age in female subjects. A significant correlation was detected between expression levels of these genes in control subjects. The current study provides further supports for contribution of CYFIP1/2 in the pathogenesis of ASD and potentiates it as a peripheral marker for ASD diagnosis. Future studies in larger sample sizes are needed to confirm the results of the current study.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Tracking the Influence of Autistic Traits on Competencies Among School Aged Children with Subthreshold Autistic Traits: A Longitudinal Study.This study aims to further explore the implications of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms for children who do not meet full diagnostic criteria. More specific characterization of how challenges present relative to traits of ASD such as social responsiveness is vital to developing an understanding of what competency and mental health difficulties these impairments are related to, and if they persist over time. Assessments of autistic traits, clinical symptomotology, and competency were used to quantify the relation of these domains cross-sectionally and across time. Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) scores significantly contributed to a teacher-report Happy scale from the Teacher's Report Form and a parent-report Social scale from the Child Behavior Checklist. No significant longitudinal models emerged. Splitting the SRS scores into three severity classes revealed that impaired social responsiveness is significantly related to competency, unlike average or below average deficits. Implications of subthreshold ASD traits on competency outcomes are discussed.\n",

      "ABSTRACT A Statistical Framework for Mapping Risk Genes from De Novo Mutations in Whole-Genome-Sequencing Studies.Analysis of de novo mutations (DNMs) from sequencing data of nuclear families has identified risk genes for many complex diseases, including multiple neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Most of these efforts have focused on mutations in protein-coding sequences. Evidence from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) strongly suggests that variants important to human diseases often lie in non-coding regions. Extending DNM-based approaches to non-coding sequences is challenging, however, because the functional significance of non-coding mutations is difficult to predict. We propose a statistical framework for analyzing DNMs from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. This method, TADA-Annotations (TADA-A), is a major advance of the TADA method we developed earlier for DNM analysis in coding regions. TADA-A is able to incorporate many functional annotations such as conservation and enhancer marks, to learn from data which annotations are informative of pathogenic mutations, and to combine both coding and non-coding mutations at the gene level to detect risk genes. It also supports meta-analysis of multiple DNM studies, while adjusting for study-specific technical effects. We applied TADA-A to WGS data of ∼300 autism-affected family trios across five studies and discovered several autism risk genes. The software is freely available for all research uses.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Seeing More Than Human: Autism and Anthropomorphic Theory of Mind.Theory of mind (ToM) is defined as the process of taking another's perspective. Anthropomorphism can be seen as the extension of ToM to non-human entities. This review examines the literature concerning ToM and anthropomorphism in relation to individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), specifically addressing the questions of how and why those on the spectrum both show an increased interest for anthropomorphism and may even show improved ToM abilities when judging the mental states of anthropomorphic characters. This review highlights that while individuals with ASD traditionally show deficits on a wide range of ToM tests, such as recognizing facial emotions, such ToM deficits may be ameliorated if the stimuli presented is cartoon or animal-like rather than in human form. Individuals with ASD show a greater interest in anthropomorphic characters and process the features of these characters using methods typically reserved for human stimuli. Personal accounts of individuals with ASD also suggest they may identify more closely with animals than other humans. It is shown how the social motivations hypothesized to underlie the anthropomorphizing of non-human targets may lead those on the spectrum to seek social connections and therefore gain ToM experience and expertise amongst unlikely sources.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Autistic traits, but not schizotypy, predict increased weighting of sensory information in Bayesian visual integration.Recent theories propose that schizophrenia/schizotypy and autistic spectrum disorder are related to impairments in Bayesian inference that is, how the brain integrates sensory information (likelihoods) with prior knowledge. However existing accounts fail to clarify: (i) how proposed theories differ in accounts of ASD vs. schizophrenia and (ii) whether the impairments result from weaker priors or enhanced likelihoods. Here, we directly address these issues by characterizing how 91 healthy participants, scored for autistic and schizotypal traits, implicitly learned and combined priors with sensory information. This was accomplished through a visual statistical learning paradigm designed to quantitatively assess variations in individuals' likelihoods and priors. The acquisition of the priors was found to be intact along both traits spectra. However, autistic traits were associated with more veridical perception and weaker influence of expectations. Bayesian modeling revealed that this was due, not to weaker prior expectations, but to more precise sensory representations.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Acceptability and caregiver-reported outcomes for young children with autism spectrum disorder whose parents attended a preventative population-based intervention for anxiety: A pilot study.This pilot study explored acceptability to parents and outcomes for children of a preventive intervention for anxiety problems in pre-schoolers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who were an identified sub-group within a population-based randomised trial of the Cool Little Kids parenting group programme. The population trial included 545 temperamentally inhibited pre-schoolers recruited across eight economically diverse areas of Melbourne, Australia. Within this sample, 26 parents reported that their child had received an ASD diagnosis. Trial measures included baseline inhibited temperament and developmental problems, post-intervention feedback on the programme, and caregiver-reported child mental health outcomes (anxiety diagnoses and internalising symptoms) at 1- and 2-year follow-up. Sample retention for the children with ASD over 2 years was strong (92%). At follow-up, fewer intervention than control children with ASD had anxiety disorders after 1 year (% (n): 25 (3) vs. 77 (10), P = .028) and separation anxiety symptoms after 2 years (M (SD): 4.22 (2.68) vs. 9.38 (5.91), P = .017). Similar effects favouring the intervention group were apparent across other child emotional outcome measures but without statistical significance in this small sample. Parents of the children with ASD reported that Cool Little Kids was \"quite useful\" in relation to their child's anxiety but also gave feedback that they would appreciate some tailoring of programme content to the context of ASD. These pilot findings suggest Cool Little Kids may be helpful for reducing comorbid anxiety in pre-schoolers with ASD. Further research is warranted to develop an ASD-specific adaptation which can be trialled with a larger sample of children with confirmed ASD diagnosis.

This pilot study explored acceptability to parents and outcomes for pre-schoolers with ASD of a parenting group programme to prevent anxiety problems. Among the sample of 26 pre-schoolers with ASD, we found reduced anxiety disorders and separation symptoms when their parents had received the intervention, as reported by caregivers in checklists and clinical interviews. Parents gave feedback that the programme was useful but suggested content be adapted to the context of ASD.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Autism Spectrum Disorder: Classification, diagnosis and therapy.Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) refers to a group of neurodevelopmental disorders including autism, Asperger's syndrome (AS) and pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). The new diagnostic criteria of ASD focuses on two core domains: social communication impairment and restricted interests/repetitive behaviors. The prevalence of ASD has been steadily increasing over the past two decades, with current estimates reaching up to 1 in 36 children. Hereditary factors, parental history of psychiatric disorders, pre-term births, and fetal exposure to psychotropic drugs or insecticides have all been linked to higher risk of ASD. Several scales such as the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), The Autism Spectrum Disorder-Observation for Children (ASD-OC), The Developmental, Dimensional, and Diagnostic Interview (3di), are available to aid in better assessing the behaviors and symptoms associated with ASD. Nearly 75% of ASD patients suffer from comorbid psychiatric illnesses or conditions, which may include attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, Tourette syndrome, and others. Both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions are available for ASD. Pharmacological treatments include psychostimulants, atypical antipsychotics, antidepressants, and alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists. These medications provide partial symptomatic relief of core symptoms of ASD or manage the symptoms of comorbid conditions. Non-pharmacological interventions, which show promising evidence in improving social interaction and verbal communication of ASD patients, include music therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy and social behavioral therapy. Hormonal therapies with oxytocyin or vasopressin receptor antagonists have also shown some promise in improving core ASD symptoms. The use of vitamins, herbal remedies and nutritional supplements in conjunction with pharmacological and behavioral treatment appear to have some effect in symptomatic improvement in ASD, though additional studies are needed to confirm these benefits. Developing novel disease-modifying therapies may prove to be the ultimate intervention for sustained improvement of symptoms in ASD.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The Autism-Related Protein CHD8 Cooperates with C/EBPβ to Regulate Adipogenesis.The gene encoding the chromatin remodeler CHD8 is the most frequently mutated gene in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Heterozygous mutations in CHD8 give rise to ASD that is often accompanied by macrocephaly, gastrointestinal complaints, and slender habitus. Whereas most phenotypes of CHD8 haploinsufficiency likely result from delayed neurodevelopment, the mechanism underlying slender habitus has remained unknown. Here, we show that CHD8 interacts with CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) and promotes its transactivation activity during adipocyte differentiation. Adipogenesis was impaired in Chd8-deleted preadipocytes, with the upregulation of C/EBPα and peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), two master regulators of this process, being attenuated in mutant cells. Furthermore, mice with CHD8 ablation in white preadipocytes had a markedly reduced white adipose tissue mass. Our findings reveal a mode of C/EBPβ regulation by CHD8 during adipogenesis, with CHD8 deficiency resulting in a defect in the development of white adipose tissue.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Pathobiology of Christianson syndrome: Linking disrupted endosomal-lysosomal function with intellectual disability and sensory impairments.Christianson syndrome (CS) is a recently described rare neurogenetic disorder presenting early in life with a broad range of neurological symptoms, including severe intellectual disability with nonverbal status, hyperactivity, epilepsy, and progressive ataxia due to cerebellar atrophy. CS is due to loss-of-function mutations in SLC9A6, encoding NHE6, a sodium-hydrogen exchanger involved in the regulation of early endosomal pH. Here we review what is currently known about the neuropathogenesis of CS, based on insights from experimental models, which to date have focused on mechanisms that affect the CNS, specifically the brain. In addition, parental reports of sensory disturbances in their children with CS, including an apparent insensitivity to pain, led us to explore sensory function and related neuropathology in Slc9a6 KO mice. We present new data showing sensory deficits in Slc9a6 KO mice, which had reduced behavioral responses to noxious thermal and mechanical stimuli (Hargreaves and Von Frey assays, respectively) compared to wild type (WT) littermates. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analysis of the spinal cord and peripheral nervous system revealed intracellular accumulation of the glycosphingolipid GM2 ganglioside in KO but not WT mice. This cellular storage phenotype was most abundant in neurons of lamina I-II of the dorsal horn, a major relay site in the processing of painful stimuli. Spinal cords of KO mice also exhibited changes in astroglial and microglial populations throughout the gray matter suggestive of a neuroinflammatory process. Our findings establish the Slc9a6 KO mouse as a relevant tool for studying the sensory deficits in CS, and highlight selective vulnerabilities in relevant cell populations that may contribute to this phenotype. How NHE6 loss of function leads to such a multifaceted neurological syndrome is still undefined, and it is likely that NHE6 is involved with many cellular processes critical to normal nervous system development and function. In addition, the sensory issues exhibited by Slc9a6 KO mice, in combination with our neuropathological findings, are consistent with NHE6 loss of function impacting the entire nervous system. Sensory dysfunction in intellectually disabled individuals is challenging to assess and may impair patient safety and quality of life. Further mechanistic studies of the neurological impairments underlying CS and other genetic intellectual disability disorders must also take into account mechanisms affecting broader nervous system function in order to understand the full range of associated disabilities.\n",

The present study evaluated the effects of video-based group instruction (VGI) on the acquisition of social perception skills of five adolescents with ASD or ID in a public school setting. Social perception involves observing affective behaviors of others, discriminating relevant environmental stimuli, and differentially reinforcing the affective behavior of another person. Typically developing peers supported VGI implementation as social partners for participants. A multiple probe design across behaviors demonstrated the effectiveness of VGI for teaching social perception skills. Four of five participants acquired and maintained the targeted social perception skills, and we observed some transfer to a nontreatment setting. Results of this study suggest VGI may support the acquisition of social perception among adolescents with ASD or ID.\n",

      "ABSTRACT TPH2 polymorphisms across the spectrum of psychiatric morbidity: A systematic review and meta-analysis.Tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) is the rate-limiting enzyme in brain serotonin synthesis. The TPH2 gene has frequently been investigated in relation to psychiatric morbidity. The aim of the present review is to integrate results from association studies between TPH2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and various psychiatric disorders, which we furthermore quantified with meta-analysis. We reviewed 166 studies investigating 69 TPH2 SNPs in a broad range of psychiatric disorders, including over 30,000 patients. According to our meta-analysis, TPH2 polymorphisms show strongest associations with mood disorders, suicide (attempt) and schizophrenia. Despite small effect sizes, we conclude that TPH2 SNPs in the coding and non-coding areas (rs4570625, rs11178997, rs11178998, rs10748185, rs1843809, rs4290270, rs17110747) are each associated with one or more psychopathological conditions. Our findings highlight the possible common serotonergic mechanisms of the investigated psychiatric disorders. Yet, the functional relevance of most TPH2 polymorphisms is unclear. Characterizing how exactly the different TPH2 variants influence the serotonergic neurotransmission is a next necessary step in understanding the psychiatric disorders where serotonin is implicated.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Measurement properties of tools used to assess suicidality in autistic and general population adults: A systematic review.Adults diagnosed with autism are at significantly increased risk of suicidal thoughts, suicidal behaviours and dying by suicide. However, it is unclear whether any validated tools are currently available to effectively assess suicidality in autistic adults in research and clinical practice. This is crucial for understanding and preventing premature death by suicide in this vulnerable group. This two stage systematic review therefore aimed to identify tools used to assess suicidality in autistic and general population adults, evaluate these tools for their appropriateness and measurement properties, and make recommendations for appropriate selection of suicidality assessment tools in research and clinical practice. Three databases were searched (PsycInfo, Medline and Web of Knowledge). Four frequently used suicidality assessment tools were identified, and subsequently rated for quality of the evidence in support of their measurement properties using the COSMIN checklist. Despite studies having explored suicidality in autistic adults, none had utilised a validated tool. Overall, there was lack of evidence in support of suicidality risk assessments successfully predicting future suicide attempts. We recommend adaptations to current suicidality assessment tools and priorities for future research, in order to better conceptualise suicidality and its measurement in autism.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Closed Loop Deep Brain Stimulation for PTSD, Addiction, and Disorders of Affective Facial Interpretation: Review and Discussion of Potential Biomarkers and Stimulation Paradigms.The treatment of psychiatric diseases with Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is becoming more of a reality as studies proliferate the indications and targets for therapies. Opinions on the initial failures of DBS trials for some psychiatric diseases point to a certain lack of finesse in using an Open Loop DBS (OLDBS) system in these dynamic, cyclical pathologies. OLDBS delivers monomorphic input into dysfunctional brain circuits with modulation of that input via human interface at discrete time points with no interim modulation or adaptation to the changing circuit dynamics. Closed Loop DBS (CLDBS) promises dynamic, intrinsic circuit modulation based on individual physiologic biomarkers of dysfunction. Discussed here are several psychiatric diseases which may be amenable to CLDBS paradigms as the neurophysiologic dysfunction is stochastic and not static. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) has several peripheral and central physiologic and neurologic changes preceding stereotyped hyper-activation behavioral responses. Biomarkers for CLDBS potentially include skin conductance changes indicating changes in the sympathetic nervous system, changes in serum and central neurotransmitter concentrations, and limbic circuit activation. Chemical dependency and addiction have been demonstrated to be improved with both ablation and DBS of the Nucleus Accumbens and as a serendipitous side effect of movement disorder treatment. Potential peripheral biomarkers are similar to those proposed for PTSD with possible use of environmental and geolocation based cues, peripheral signs of physiologic arousal, and individual changes in central circuit patterns. Non-substance addiction disorders have also been serendipitously treated in patients with OLDBS for movement disorders. As more is learned about these behavioral addictions, DBS targets and effectors will be identified. Finally, discussed is the use of facial recognition software to modulate activation of inappropriate responses for psychiatric diseases in which misinterpretation of social cues feature prominently. These include Autism Spectrum Disorder, PTSD, and Schizophrenia-all of which have a common feature of dysfunctional interpretation of facial affective clues. Technological advances and improvements in circuit-based, individual-specific, real-time adaptable modulation, forecast functional neurosurgery treatments for heretofore treatment-resistant behavioral diseases.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Development of the Mental Synthesis Evaluation Checklist (MSEC): A Parent-Report Tool for Mental Synthesis Ability Assessment in Children with Language Delay.Mental synthesis is the conscious purposeful process of synthesizing novel mental images from objects stored in memory. Mental synthesis ability is essential for understanding complex syntax, spatial prepositions, and verb tenses. In typical children, the timeline of mental synthesis acquisition is highly correlated with an increasing vocabulary. Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), on the other hand, may learn hundreds of words but never acquire mental synthesis. In these individuals, tests assessing vocabulary comprehension may fail to demonstrate the profound deficit in mental synthesis. We developed a parent-reported Mental Synthesis Evaluation Checklist (MSEC) designed to assess mental synthesis acquisition in ASD children. The psychometric quality of MSEC was tested with 3715 parents of ASD children. Internal reliability of the 20-item MSEC was good (Cronbach's alpha >0.9). MSEC exhibited adequate test⁻retest reliability; good construct validity, supported by a positive correlation with the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC) Communication subscale; and good known group validity reflected by the difference in MSEC scores for children of different ASD severity levels. The MSEC questionnaire is copyright-free and can be used by researchers as a complimentary subscale for the ATEC evaluation. We hope that the addition of MSEC will make the combined assessment more sensitive to small steps in a child's development. As MSEC does not rely on productive language, it may be an especially useful tool for assessing the development of nonverbal and minimally verbal children.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Dysbiosis of microbiome and probiotic treatment in a genetic model of autism spectrum disorders.Recent studies have determined that the microbiome has direct effects on behavior, and may be dysregulated in neurodevelopmental conditions. Considering that neurodevelopmental conditions, such as autism, have a strong genetic etiology, it is necessary to understand if genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Shank3, can influence the gut microbiome, and if probiotics can be a therapeutic tool. In this study, we have identified dysregulation of several genera and species of bacteria in the gut and colon of both male and female Shank3 KO mice. L. reuteri, a species with decreased relative abundance in the Shank3 KO mice, positively correlated with the expression of gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor subunits in the brain. Treatment of Shank3 KO mice with L. reuteri induced an attenuation of unsocial behavior specifically in male Shank3 mice, and a decrease in repetitive behaviors in both male and female Shank3 KO mice. In addition, L. reuteri treatment affected GABA receptor gene expression and protein levels in multiple brain regions. This study identifies bacterial species that are sensitive to an autism-related mutation, and further suggests a therapeutic potential for probiotic treatment.\n",

The penetrance of these defects is not complete since they often are inherited from a healthy parent. Using array-CGH in a cohort of 37 ASD patients, we found 2 subjects harboring a deletion inside the IMMP2L gene. In both cases, the IMMP2L gene deletion was inherited: from a healthy mother in one case and from a dyslectic father in the other. In the latter family, the IMMP2L deletion was also detected in the patient's brother, who showed delayed language development. In a cohort of 100 normal controls, no deletions including the IMMP2L gene were observed. However, a recent meta-analysis found no association between IMMP2L deletions and ASD. Our data would indicate that deletions involving the IMMP2L gene may contribute to the development of a subgroup of cognitive/behavioral disorders.\n",

Children with high ASD symptomology outperformed all others on complex visual search tasks, but only if their motor skills were rated at, or above, age expectations. For the visual crowding task, children with high ASD symptomology and superior motor skills exhibited enhanced target discrimination, whereas those with high ASD symptomology but poor motor skills experienced deficits.

      "ABSTRACT The categorisation of resistance: interpreting failure to follow a proposed line of action in the diagnosis of autism amongst young adults.Many characteristics typical of autism, a neurodevelopmental condition characterised by socio-communicative impairments, are most evident during social interaction. Accordingly, procedures such as the Autism Diagnosis Observation Schedule (ADOS) are interactive and intended to elicit interactional impairments: a diagnosis of autism is given if interactional difficulties are attributed as a persistent quality of the individual undergoing diagnosis. This task is difficult, first, because behaviours can be interpreted in various ways and, second, because conversation breakdown may indicate a disengagement with, or resistance to, a line of conversation. Drawing upon conversation analysis, we examine seven ADOS diagnosis sessions and ask how diagnosticians distinguish between interactional resistance as, on the one hand, a diagnostic indicator and, on the other, as a reasonable choice from a range of possible responses. We find evidence of various forms of resistance during ADOS sessions, but it is a resistance to a line of conversational action that is often determined to be indicative of autism. However, and as we show, this attribution of resistance can be ambiguous. We conclude by arguing for reflexive practice during any diagnosis where talk is the problem, and for a commitment to acknowledge the potential impact of diagnostic procedures themselves upon results.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Palmitoylethanolamide as adjunctive therapy for autism: Efficacy and safety results from a randomized controlled trial.Inflammation as well as glutamate excitotoxicity have been proposed to participate in the propagation of autism. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is an endocannabinoid proven to prevent glutamatergic toxicity and inhibit inflammatory responses simultaneously. The present randomized, parallel group, double-blind placebo-controlled trial is the first study depicted to probe the efficacy of co-treatment with risperidone and PEA over 10 weeks in children with autism. Seventy children (aged 4-12 years) with autism and moderate to severe symptoms of irritability were randomly assigned to two treatment regimens. The study outcomes were measured using the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community Edition (ABC-C). At trial endpoint (week 10), combination of PEA and risperidone had superior efficacy in ameliorating the ABC-irritability and hyperactivity/noncompliance symptoms (Cohen's d, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.94, 0.41 to 1.46, p = 0.001) compared with a risperidone plus placebo regimen. Interestingly, effect of combination treatment on hyperactivity symptoms was also observed at trial midpoint (week 5) but with a smaller effect size (d = 0.53, p = 0.04) than that at the endpoint (d = 0.94, p = 0.001). Meanwhile, there was a trend toward significance for superior effect of risperidone plus PEA over risperidone plus placebo on inappropriate speech at trial endpoint (d = 0.51, p = 0.051). No significant differences existed between the two treatment groups for the other two ABC-C subscales (lethargy/social withdrawal and stereotypic behavior). The findings suggest that PEA may augment therapeutic effects of risperidone on autism-related irritability and hyperactivity. Future studies are warranted to investigate whether PEA can serve as a stand-alone treatment for autism.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Social interaction-induced activation of RNA splicing in the amygdala of microbiome-deficient mice.Social behaviour is regulated by activity of host-associated microbiota across multiple species. However, the molecular mechanisms mediating this relationship remain elusive. We therefore determined the dynamic, stimulus-dependent transcriptional regulation of germ-free (GF) and GF mice colonised post weaning (exGF) in the amygdala, a brain region critically involved in regulating social interaction. In GF mice the dynamic response seen in controls was attenuated and replaced by a marked increase in expression of splicing factors and alternative exon usage in GF mice upon stimulation, which was even more pronounced in exGF mice. In conclusion, we demonstrate a molecular basis for how the host microbiome is crucial for a normal behavioural response during social interaction. Our data further suggest that social behaviour is correlated with the gene-expression response in the amygdala, established during neurodevelopment as a result of host-microbe interactions. Our findings may help toward understanding neurodevelopmental events leading to social behaviour dysregulation, such as those found in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).\n",

      "ABSTRACT Early Seizures Prematurely Unsilence Auditory Synapses to Disrupt Thalamocortical Critical Period Plasticity.Heightened neural excitability in infancy and childhood results in increased susceptibility to seizures. Such early-life seizures are associated with language deficits and autism that can result from aberrant development of the auditory cortex. Here, we show that early-life seizures disrupt a critical period (CP) for tonotopic map plasticity in primary auditory cortex (A1). We show that this CP is characterized by a prevalence of \"silent,\" NMDA-receptor (NMDAR)-only, glutamate receptor synapses in auditory cortex that become \"unsilenced\" due to activity-dependent AMPA receptor (AMPAR) insertion. Induction of seizures prior to this CP occludes tonotopic map plasticity by prematurely unsilencing NMDAR-only synapses. Further, brief treatment with the AMPAR antagonist NBQX following seizures, prior to the CP, prevents synapse unsilencing and permits subsequent A1 plasticity. These findings reveal that early-life seizures modify CP regulators and suggest that therapeutic targets for early post-seizure treatment can rescue CP plasticity.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Human-Specific NOTCH2NL Genes Affect Notch Signaling and Cortical Neurogenesis.Genetic changes causing brain size expansion in human evolution have remained elusive. Notch signaling is essential for radial glia stem cell proliferation and is a determinant of neuronal number in the mammalian cortex. We find that three paralogs of human-specific NOTCH2NL are highly expressed in radial glia. Functional analysis reveals that different alleles of NOTCH2NL have varying potencies to enhance Notch signaling by interacting directly with NOTCH receptors. Consistent with a role in Notch signaling, NOTCH2NL ectopic expression delays differentiation of neuronal progenitors, while deletion accelerates differentiation into cortical neurons. Furthermore, NOTCH2NL genes provide the breakpoints in 1q21.1 distal deletion/duplication syndrome, where duplications are associated with macrocephaly and autism and deletions with microcephaly and schizophrenia.

      "ABSTRACT Randomized Control Trial of COMPASS for Improving Transition Outcomes of Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder.The postsecondary outcomes of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are significantly worse than peers with other disabilities. One problem is the lack of empirically-supported transition planning interventions to guide services and help produce better outcomes. We applied an implementation science approach to adapt and modify an evidence-based consultation intervention originally tested with young children called the Collaborative Model for Promoting Competence and Success (COMPASS; Ruble et al., The collaborative model for promoting competence and success for students with ASD. Springer, New York, 2012a) and evaluate it for efficacy in a randomized controlled trial for transition-age youth. Results replicated findings with younger students with ASD that IEP outcomes were higher for COMPASS compared to the placebo control group (d = 2.1).

The contributions of parental variables, as well as child's autism symptom severity and verbal skills, to the parent interaction style were examined. Parents of HR-SIBS exhibited a higher level of synchronous-demanding behaviors, which was associated with parental report of atypical mood in the infant, but not with autism symptom severity, verbal skills, or parental depressive symptoms.

Oxytocin and its signaling pathway are related to a range of human behaviors, from facial expression recognition to aggressive behaviors, and have been suggested as involved in the etiology of ASD. Our aim was to evaluate the influence of two polymorphisms (rs1042778, rs53576) at the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) on ASD diagnosis and on specific ASD-related clinical symptoms (seizures, panic, and aggressive behaviors). We also assessed if these SNPs could be related to changes in OXTR availability and functionality using a bioinformatic approach. The sample was composed by 209 probands with ASD and their biological parents. Family-based approach and logistic regression models were used to investigated the outcomes.

      "ABSTRACT A Pilot Investigation of Individual and Dyad Instructional Arrangements.An essential goal for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is to reach maximal independence on a variety of tasks that facilitate academic and vocational engagement and community integration. One-to-one instructional arrangements do not adequately prepare individuals with autism to function within various group contexts and limit opportunities for positive social interactions with one or more peers. Furthermore, group instructional formats have multiple benefits, including potentially increased instructional time and additional learning opportunities. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the acquisition and maintenance of verbal behavior targets in individual and dyad instruction, as well as to compare levels of engagement across these instructional arrangements. Results suggest that three of the four participants acquired more targets during individual instruction, and three of the four participants maintained more targets within individual instruction. In addition, three of the four participants spent less time in instruction and more time on break during dyad instruction. These findings demonstrate the diversity of outcomes for dyad instruction for people with ASD. Directions for future research and suggestions for clinical implementation are provided.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Prospects of Zinc Supplementation in Autism Spectrum Disorders and Shankopathies Such as Phelan McDermid Syndrome.The loss of one copy of SHANK3 (SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 3) in humans highly contributes to Phelan McDermid syndrome (PMDS). In addition, SHANK3 was identified as a major autism candidate gene. Interestingly, the protein encoded by the SHANK3 gene is regulated by zinc. While zinc deficiency depletes synaptic pools of Shank3, increased zinc levels were shown to promote synaptic scaffold formation. Therefore, the hypothesis arises that patients with PMDS and Autism caused by Shankopathies, having one intact copy of SHANK3 left, may benefit from zinc supplementation, as elevated zinc may drive remaining Shank3 into the post-synaptic density (PSD) and may additional recruit Shank2, a second zinc-dependent member of the SHANK gene family. Further, elevated synaptic zinc levels may modulate E/I ratios affecting other synaptic components such as NMDARs. However, several factors need to be considered in relation to zinc supplementation such as the role of Shank3 in the gastrointestinal (GI) system-the location of zinc absorption in humans. Therefore, here, we briefly discuss the prospect and impediments of zinc supplementation in disorders affecting Shank3 such as PMDS and propose a model for most efficacious supplementation.\n",

The body of the tutorial provides an overview of four different forms of genetic variation, highlighting the potential associations with autism and available genetic testing.

These signaling pathways can perturb neuronal structure, chemistry, and function, leading to discrete changes in behavior. They are also increasingly implicated in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. The importance of these humoral signaling pathways is perhaps most powerfully illustrated in the context of infection and inflammation. Here we provide an overview of how interaction of immune activation of neural and humoral interoceptive mechanisms mediates discrete changes in brain and behavior and highlight how activation of these pathways at specific points in neural development may predispose to psychiatric disorder. As our mechanistic understanding of these interoceptive pathways continues to emerge, it is revealing novel therapeutic targets, potentially heralding an exciting new era of immunotherapies in psychiatry.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Alterations in neuronal cytoskeletal and astrocytic proteins content in the brain of the autistic-like mouse strain C58/J.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopment disorder characterized by deficient social interaction, impaired communication as well as repetitive behaviors. ASD subjects present connectivity and neuroplasticity disturbances associated with morphological alterations in axons, dendrites, and dendritic spines. Given that the neuronal cytoskeleton and astrocytes have an essential role in regulating several mechanisms of neural plasticity, the aim of this work was to study alterations in the content of neuronal cytoskeletal components actin and tubulin and their associated proteins, as well as astrocytic proteins GFAP and TSP-1 in the brain of a C58/J mouse model of ASD. We determined the expression and regulatory phosphorylation state of cytoskeletal components in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum of C58/J mice by means of Western blotting. Our results show that autistic-like mice present: 1) region-dependent altered expression and phosphorylation patterns of Tau isoforms, associated with anomalous microtubule depolymerization; 2) reduced MAP2 A content in prefrontal cortex; 3) region-dependent changes in cofilin expression and phosphorylation, associated with abnormal actin filament depolymerizing dynamics; 4) diminished synaptopodin levels in the hippocampus; and 5) reduced content of the astrocyte-secreted protein TSP-1 in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Our work demonstrates changes in the expression and phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins as well as in TSP-1 in the brain of the autistic-like mice C58/J, shedding light in one of the possible molecular mechanisms underpinning neuroplasticity alterations in the ASD brain and laying the foundation for future investigations in this topic.\n",

Mounting evidence supports the premise that the intestinal microbiota plays a pivotal role in its function and has led to the more common and perhaps more accurate term gut-microbiota-brain axis. Numerous studies have identified associations between an altered microbiome and neuroimmune and neuroinflammatory diseases. In most cases, it is unknown if these associations are cause or effect; notwithstanding, maintaining or restoring homeostasis of the microbiota may represent future opportunities when treating or preventing these diseases. In recent years, several studies have identified the diet as a primary contributing factor in shaping the composition of the gut microbiota and, in turn, the mucosal and systemic immune systems. In this review, we will discuss the potential opportunities and challenges with respect to modifying and shaping the microbiota through diet and nutrition in order to treat or prevent neuroimmune and neuroinflammatory disease.\n",

Forty-five adults with ASC and 42 adults without ASC completed questionnaires regarding violence victimization and perpetration, emotion regulation, and sociocommunicative competence. Participants with ASC reported experiencing, as children, more overall victimization; specifically, more property crime, maltreatment, teasing/emotional bullying, and sexual assault by peers, compared to participants without ASC. Participants with ASC also reported experiencing more teasing/emotional bullying in adulthood and greater sexual contact victimization. No significant differences were found between groups on perpetration. Sociocommunicative ability and emotion regulation deficits did not explain the heightened risk for victimization. Individuals with ASC have an increased vulnerability to violence victimization, which speaks to the need for interventions, and proactive prevention strategies.\n",

Many of these effects are mediated by metabolites that are either produced by the microbes or derived from the transformation of environmental or host molecules. Among the array of metabolites at the interface between these microorganisms and the host is the essential aromatic amino acid tryptophan (Trp). In the gut, the three major Trp metabolism pathways leading to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), kynurenine (Kyn), and indole derivatives are under the direct or indirect control of the microbiota. In this review, we gather the most recent advances concerning the central role of Trp metabolism in microbiota-host crosstalk in health and disease.

These factors include increased daily exposure to various toxic metal-based environmental pollutants, which represent a cause for concern in public health. This article reviews the most relevant toxic metals, commonly found, environmental pollutants, i.e., lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), aluminum (Al), and the metalloid arsenic (As). Additionally, it discusses how pollutants can be a possible pathogenetic cause of ASD through various mechanisms including neuroinflammation in different regions of the brain, fundamentally occurring through elevation of the proinflammatory profile of cytokines and aberrant expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). Due to the worldwide increase in toxic environmental pollution, studies on the role of pollutants in neurodevelopmental disorders, including direct effects on the developing brain and the subjects' genetic susceptibility and polymorphism, are of utmost importance to achieve the best therapeutic approach and preventive strategies.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Genomics of autism spectrum disorder: approach to therapy.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly prevalent neurodevelopmental condition with no current treatment available. Although advances in genetics and genomics have identified hundreds of genes associated with ASD, very little is known about the pathophysiology of ASD and the functional contribution of specific genes to ASD phenotypes. Improved understanding of the biological function of ASD-associated genes and how this heterogeneous group of genetic variants leads to the disease is needed in order to develop therapeutic strategies. Here, we review the current state of ASD research related to gene discovery and examples of emerging molecular mechanisms (protein translation and alternative splicing). In addition, we discuss how patient-derived three-dimensional brain organoids might provide an opportunity to model specific genetic variants in order to define molecular and cellular defects that could be amenable for developing and screening personalized therapies related to ASD.\n",

The analyses of the absolute consumption of two flavored food by male rats prenatally exposed to valproic acid (VPA) and treated with resveratrol (RSV), showed that VPA animals show a trend to eat less of the flavored food presented by a demonstrator rat. We also identified 13 microRNA with similar levels among rodents' experimental groups, as well as 11 microRNA with no alterations between autistic and control subjects.

      "ABSTRACT An experimental demonstration of AAB renewal in children with autism spectrum disorder.Operant renewal is a return of extinguished behavior due to changes in contextual stimuli that control the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a response. Well-established in classical conditioning and operant research, renewal presents itself in three forms-ABA, ABC, and AAB-and poses threats to treatment maintenance where extinction procedures are utilized. As AAB renewal may be less likely to occur than ABA or ABC renewal, the current study sought to determine if AAB renewal would occur with three participants with Autism Spectrum Disorder who were taught a simple lever pull response. Results showed that lever pulls increased for two of three participants when we introduced novel stimuli (i.e., a light and a buzzer) to alter the contextual environment after extinction. These findings suggest that AAB renewal may account for some instances of response recovery after extinction and that the procedure of this study may be beneficial to the further study of renewal and the variables that affect its occurrence within a translational model.\n",

We used a multiple-baseline design across three participants to determine the effects of discrimination training on the discrimination of consequences applied to modeled responses using both known and unknown pictures. During baseline, participants were exposed to modeled correct and incorrect picture labels and were observed to imitate modeled responses that were incorrect and followed by negative feedback. During discrimination training, we taught participants to label known pictures regardless of observed responses and consequences. With unknown pictures, we taught participants to imitate correct and reinforced modeled responses, and to say, \"I don't know,\" when modeled responses were incorrect and received negative feedback. Test sessions measured responding to known and unknown pictures and showed acquisition over baseline levels. Generalization to pictures not associated with training was variable.

      "ABSTRACT Being vs. Appearing Socially Uninterested: Challenging Assumptions about Social Motivation in Autism.Progress in psychological science can be limited by a number of factors, not least of which are the starting assumptions of scientists themselves. We believe that some influential accounts of autism rest on a questionable assumption that many of its behavioral characteristics indicate a lack of social interest-an assumption that is flatly contradicted by the testimony of many autistic people themselves. In this paper, we challenge this assumption by describing alternative explanations for four such behaviors: (a) low levels of eye contact, (b) infrequent pointing, (c) motor stereotypies, and (d) echolalia. The assumption that autistic people's unusual behaviors indicate diminished social motivation has had profound and often negative effects on the ways they are studied and treated. We argue that understanding and supporting autistic individuals will require interrogating this assumption, taking autistic testimony seriously, considering alternative explanations for unusual behaviors, and investigating unconventional-even idiosyncratic-ways that autistic individuals may express their social interest. These steps are crucial, we believe, for creating a more accurate, humane, and useful science of autism.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Coping strategies of parents of children with autism spectrum disorder: a systematic review.To deal with stress, parents of children with ASD use coping strategies that help to tackle the challenging situations of raising their child. This systematic review examines parental coping strategy's questionnaires, factors which influence these coping strategies, interactions between these strategies and perceived stress and their impact on parental quality of life. According to PRISMA guidelines, an electronic search was conducted on Medline, PsycInfo and Eric: 156 articles were identified and 11 studies were selected. Many types of self-reported questionnaires were used to assess parental coping strategies. Studies highlighted that parents of a child with ASD used more avoidance strategies and less social support-seeking strategies than those of typical children. Furthermore, problem-focused coping protects parental stress and quality of life, that on the contrary, emotion-focused coping is a risk factor for alteration. Our systematic review illustrates the need to adapt psychoeducational interventions for parents of children with ASD.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Toward a Phenomenological Account of Embodied Subjectivity in Autism.Sensorimotor research is currently challenging the dominant understanding of autism as a deficit in the cognitive ability to 'mindread'. This marks an emerging shift in autism research from a focus on the structure and processes of the mind to a focus on autistic behavior as grounded in the body. Contemporary researchers in sensorimotor differences in autism call for a reconciliation between the scientific understanding of autism and the first-person experience of autistic individuals. I argue that fulfilling this ambition requires a phenomenological understanding of the body as it presents itself in ordinary experience, namely as the subject of experience rather than a physical object. On this basis, I investigate how the phenomenology of Maurice Merleau-Ponty can be employed as a frame of understanding for bodily experience in autism. Through a phenomenological analysis of Tito Mukhopadhyay's autobiographical work, How can I talk if my lips don't move (2009), I illustrate the relevance and potential of phenomenological philosophy in autism research, arguing that this approach enables a deeper understanding of bodily and subjective experiences related to autism.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Dual Requirement of CHD8 for Chromatin Landscape Establishment and Histone Methyltransferase Recruitment to Promote CNS Myelination and Repair.Disruptive mutations in chromatin remodeler CHD8 cause autism spectrum disorders, exhibiting widespread white matter abnormalities; however, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We show that cell-type specific Chd8 deletion in oligodendrocyte progenitors, but not in neurons, results in myelination defects, revealing a cell-intrinsic dependence on CHD8 for oligodendrocyte lineage development, myelination and post-injury remyelination. CHD8 activates expression of BRG1-associated SWI/SNF complexes that in turn activate CHD7, thus initiating a successive chromatin remodeling cascade that orchestrates oligodendrocyte lineage progression. Genomic occupancy analyses reveal that CHD8 establishes an accessible chromatin landscape, and recruits MLL/KMT2 histone methyltransferase complexes distinctively around proximal promoters to promote oligodendrocyte differentiation. Inhibition of histone demethylase activity partially rescues myelination defects of CHD8-deficient mutants. Our data indicate that CHD8 exhibits a dual function through inducing a cascade of chromatin reprogramming and recruiting H3K4 histone methyltransferases to establish oligodendrocyte identity, suggesting potential strategies of therapeutic intervention for CHD8-associated white matter defects.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Variable behavior and repeated learning in two mouse strains: Developmental and genetic contributions.Behavioral inflexibility is often assessed using reversal learning tasks, which require a relatively low degree of response variability. No studies have assessed sensitivity to reinforcement contingencies that specifically select highly variable response patterns in mice, let alone in models of neurodevelopmental disorders involving limited response variation. Operant variability and incremental repeated acquisition (IRA) were used to assess unique aspects of behavioral variability of two mouse strains: BALB/c, a model of some deficits in ASD, and C57Bl/6. On the operant variability task, BALB/c mice responded more repetitively during adolescence than C57Bl/6 mice when reinforcement did not require variability but responded more variably when reinforcement required variability. During IRA testing in adulthood, both strains acquired an unchanging, performance sequence equally well. Strain differences emerged, however, after novel learning sequences began alternating with the performance sequence: BALB/c mice substantially outperformed C57Bl/6 mice. Using litter-mate controls, it was found that adolescent experience with variability did not affect either learning or performance on the IRA task in adulthood. These findings constrain the use of BALB/c mice as a model of ASD, but once again reveal this strain is highly sensitive to reinforcement contingencies and they are fast and robust learners.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Balance Performance in Autism: A Brief Overview.Children with autism not only have limited social and communicative skills but also have motor abnormalities, such as poor timing and coordination of balance. Moreover, impaired gross motor skills hamper participation with peers. Balance control is interesting from a cognitive science perspective, since it involves a complex interplay between information processing, motor planning, and timing and sequencing of muscle movements. In this paper, we discuss the background of motor problems in children with autism, focusing on how posture is informed by sensory information processing. We also discuss the neurobiological basis of balance problems, and how this is related to anxiety in this group. We then discuss possible avenues for treatment of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms, especially as regards movement-related interventions. Finally, we present a theoretical outlook and discuss whether some of the symptoms in ASD can be understood from an embodied cognition perspective.\n",

Second, we evaluated the discriminated generalization of the newly acquired mand by using untrained example and nonexample stimuli. Finally, we conducted maintenance probes to examine if the new, discriminated mand occurred over time in the absence of training. Results suggest that our mand training produced acquisition of a discriminated negatively-reinforced mand in all three children. Data indicate that the newly acquired, discriminated mand generalized to untrained food items and was maintained after training was discontinued.

To date, no highly reliable and effective diagnostic biomarker to assess ASD is available so far. The present study investigated the predictivity potential of some suggested markers in ASD diagnosis focusing onto the relative ratios of several plasma biomarkers of electron transport chain function, and mitochondrial metabolism in 41 patients with ASD evaluated for behavior deficits measured using Childhood Autism Rating Scales (CARS). The control matched for further 41 healthy subjects. The relation of these relative ratios to ASD severity was also examined, as well as their ability to distinguish ASD children from neurotypical children. All predictive ratios were found to be markedly altered and correlated in ASD patients. However, no ratio was connected with autism severity. Interestingly, MRCC-I/caspase-7, GSH/GST, and MRCC-I/COQ10 were the most distinctive relative ratios between neurotypical controls and ASD patients and may thereby be useful biomarkers for early diagnosis of ASD. Overall, this investigation proves that relative ratios of numerous mitochondrial biomarkers might be predictive and efficient to differentiate between neurotypical children and ASD.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Social approach, anxiety, and altered tryptophan hydroxylase 2 activity in juvenile BALB/c and C57BL/6J mice.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous and highly heritable condition with multiple aetiologies. Although the biological mechanisms underlying ASD are not fully understood, evidence suggests that dysregulation of serotonergic systems play an important role in ASD psychopathology. Preclinical models using mice with altered serotonergic neurotransmission may provide insight into the role of serotonin in behaviours relevant to clinical features of ASD. For example, BALB/c mice carry a loss-of-function single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; C1473 G) in tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (Tph2), which encodes the brain-specific isoform of the rate-limiting enzyme for serotonin synthesis, and these mice frequently have been used to model symptoms of ASD. In this study, juvenile male BALB/c (G/G; loss-of-function variant) and C57BL/6 J (C/C; wild type variant) mice, were exposed to the three-chamber sociability test, and one week later to the elevated plus-maze (EPM). Tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) activity was measured following injection of the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC)-inhibitor, NSD-1015, and subsequent HPLC detection of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) within subregions of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) and median raphe nucleus (MnR). The BALB/c mice showed reduced social behaviour and increased anxious behaviour, as well as decreased 5-HTP accumulation in the rostral and mid-rostrocaudal DR. In the full cohort of mice, TPH2 activity in the mid-rostrocaudal DR was correlated with anxious behaviour in the EPM, however these correlations were not statistically significant within each strain, suggesting that TPH2 activity was not directly associated with either anxiety or sociability. Further research is therefore required to more fully understand how serotonergic systems are involved in mouse behaviours that resemble some of the clinical features of ASD.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Increased expression of BDNF mRNA in the frontal cortex of autistic patients.Autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs) are neurodevelopmental disorders for which genetic components have been well defined. However, specific gene deregulations related to synapse function in the autistic brain have not been as extensively described. Based on a candidate genes approach, we present in this study the expression data of 4 transcripts of interest (BDNF, CAMK2a, NR-CAM and RIMS1) located at the synapse in two regions of interest in the context of the ASDs; the lobule VI of cerebellum and the Brodmann area 46. We have also genotyped in our cohort the coding single nucleotide polymorphism rs6265, located in the BDNF gene. After correction for age and sex, whereas no change was observed in the lobule VI between controls and autistic patients, we found a significant increase of BDNF expression level in the BA46 from autistic patients. No significant interaction between the rs6265 genotype and autism was observed for the BDNF expression. However, \"A\" allele carriers are more likely to have increased BDNF levels. Finally, we found a significant positive correlation between BDNF and RIMS1 expression levels. Our data suggest that these two molecules which are involved in cell signalling at the synapse, might have coordinated expressions and, that BDNF regulation in the brain has to be investigated further in the context of ASDs.\n",

The BALB/c strain of mice express a dysregulated serotonergic system and a phenotype that is relevant to ASD. In this study, juvenile male BALB/c mice were exposed to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine either chronically (18 mg/kg/day in drinking water, post-natal day (PND) 28-39) or acutely (18 mg/kg, i.p.; PND40), or to vehicle control conditions (0.9% sterile saline, i.p.; PND40), prior to being exposed to the three-chambered sociability test (SAT; PND40). One cohort of mice then received an injection of the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD-1015, and one hour later brain tissue was collected for quantification of 5-hydroxytryptophan accumulation in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) as a measure of TPH2 activity. For the second cohort, brain tissue was collected ninety minutes after the onset of the social phase of the SAT and prepared for immunohistochemical staining for c-Fos and TPH2 to measure the activation of serotonergic neurons within subregions of the DR. Acute fluoxetine decreased social behavior, while chronic fluoxetine increased social behavior compared with vehicle-treated controls. Furthermore, acute and chronic fluoxetine treatments were without effect on TPH2 activity but differentially affected populations of serotonergic neurons in the DR. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that serotonergic systems are implicated in social behavior that is relevant for ASD.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Brief Report: A Gaming Approach to the Assessment of Attention Networks in Autism Spectrum Disorder and Typical Development.Attentional impairments are among the earliest identifiable features of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Three attention networks have been extensively studied using the attention network test (ANT), but this long and repetitive task may pose challenges for individuals with ASDs. The AttentionTrip was developed as a more engaging measure of attention network efficiency. In 20 adults with ASDs and 20 typically developing controls, both tasks produced typical network scores (all p < .003, all Cohen's d > 0.78). Reaction time was less variable in the AttentionTrip than the ANT, possibly reflecting improved task engagement. Although the AttentionTrip elicited more consistent responses throughout an experimental session, anomalously low split-half reliability for its executive control network suggests that some changes may be needed.\n",

Using a qualitative methodology, the current study examined the views and experiences of ten autistic adults, ten parents of children on the autism spectrum, and ten professionals involved in autism diagnosis, all based in the United Kingdom (UK). Interviewing these 30 respondents about the diagnostic process and subsequent support options, the goal was to identify aspects of the diagnostic process that are working well, and areas in which improvements are needed.

      "ABSTRACT Increased Grik4 Gene Dosage Causes Imbalanced Circuit Output and Human Disease-Related Behaviors.Altered glutamatergic neurotransmission is thought to contribute to mental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Copy-number variation in genes associated with glutamatergic synapses represents a source of genetic variability, possibly underlying neurological and mental disease susceptibility. The GRIK4 gene encodes a high-affinity kainate receptor subunit of essentially unknown function, although de novo duplication of the 11q23.3-q24.1 locus to which it maps has been detected in autism and other disorders. To determine how changes in the dose of Grik4 affect synaptic activity, we studied mice overexpressing this gene in the forebrain. A mild gain in Grik4 enhances synaptic transmission, causing a persistent imbalance in inhibitory and excitatory activity and disturbing the circuits responsible for the main amygdala outputs. These changes in glutamatergic activity reverse when Grik4 levels are normalized; thus, they may account for the behavioral abnormalities in disorders like autism or schizophrenia.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Pitch direction ability predicts melodic perception in autism.Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) often present atypical auditory perception. Previous work has reported both enhanced low-level pitch discrimination and superior abilities to detect local pitch structure on higher-level melodic tasks in ASD. However, it is unclear how low and high levels of auditory perception are related in ASD or typical development (TD), or how this relationship might change across development and stimulus presentation rates. To these aims, in the present study, children with ASD and TD were tested on a low-level pitch direction discrimination task and a high-level melodic global-local task. Groups performed similarly on both of these auditory tasks. Moreover, individual differences in low-level pitch direction ability predicted performance on the higher-level global-local task, with a stronger relationship in ASD. Age did not affect the relationship between low-level and high-level pitch performance in either ASD or TD. However, there was a more positive effect of age on the high-level global-local task performance in TD than ASD. Finally, there was no effect of stimulus rate on the relationship between low-level and high-level pitch performance in either group. These findings provide a better understanding of how perception is associated across levels of processing in ASD versus TD. This work helps to better understand individual differences in auditory perception and to refine ASD phenotypes.\n",

They typically manifest themselves in abnormalities as reciprocal interactions and difficulties in the expression and recognition of emotions. Although peer interactions become especially important during adolescence, little is known about the mentalizing abilities of high-functioning adolescents with ASD. Here, we compared the mentalizing skills and emotion recognition abilities of 21 high-functioning adolescents with ASD and 21 matched controls. All adolescents had estimated above-average verbal intelligence levels. Spontaneous social abilities and task-related social abilities were measured using questionnaires, tasks and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. Results confirm social impairment in daily life situations in adolescents with ASD, but were not found on experimental tasks of social cognition. The use of more explicit cognitive or verbally mediating reasoning techniques and a lesser tendency of high-functioning adolescents with ASD to search for and use social information in natural environments are further discussed.\n",

      "ABSTRACT De Novo Truncating Mutations in WASF1 Cause Intellectual Disability with Seizures.Next-generation sequencing has been invaluable in the elucidation of the genetic etiology of many subtypes of intellectual disability in recent years. Here, using exome sequencing and whole-genome sequencing, we identified three de novo truncating mutations in WAS protein family member 1 (WASF1) in five unrelated individuals with moderate to profound intellectual disability with autistic features and seizures. WASF1, also known as WAVE1, is part of the WAVE complex and acts as a mediator between Rac-GTPase and actin to induce actin polymerization. The three mutations connected by Matchmaker Exchange were c.1516C>T (p.Arg506Ter), which occurs in three unrelated individuals, c.1558C>T (p.Gln520Ter), and c.1482delinsGCCAGG (p.Ile494MetfsTer23). All three variants are predicted to partially or fully disrupt the C-terminal actin-binding WCA domain. Functional studies using fibroblast cells from two affected individuals with the c.1516C>T mutation showed a truncated WASF1 and a defect in actin remodeling. This study provides evidence that de novo heterozygous mutations in WASF1 cause a rare form of intellectual disability.\n",

Despite this clear deficit in the quality of facial expression production, very little is understood about its underlying mechanisms and characteristics. This paper takes a computational approach to studying details of facial expressions of children with high functioning autism (HFA). The objective is to uncover those characteristics of facial expressions, notably distinct from those in typically developing children, and which are otherwise difficult to detect by visual inspection. We use motion capture data obtained from subjects with HFA and typically developing subjects while they produced various facial expressions. This data is analyzed to investigate how the overall and local facial dynamics of children with HFA differ from their typically developing peers. Our major observations include reduced complexity in the dynamic facial behavior of the HFA group arising primarily from the eye region.\n",

The aim of this study was to investigate the comparative effects of hesperetin (Hst) and nano-hesperetin on social behavior deficits and oxido-inflammatory indexes in prenatally valproic acid-exposed rat offspring. Pregnant Wistar rats on embryonic day 0 (E0) were segregated into six groups; Group-1 served as vehicle, received distillated water orally (PO) from E1 until the end of lactation and saline intraperitoneally (i.p) on E12.5. Group-2 received sodium valproate (500 mg/kg in 0.9% saline, i.p) on E12.5 was considered as VPA-exposed group, Group-3 to 6 were VPA-exposed which received hesperetin and nano-hesperetin (10 and 20 mg/kg/day, PO) from E0 until the end of lactation respectively. Social interaction and open field tests were conducted on postnatal day 28 (PND 28) and PND 30, cerebral antioxidant enzymes activity and biochemical indexes, the level of inflammatory factors in plasma and histopathology of cerebellum were estimated on PND 28 and PND 30. Prenatal valproic acid-exposed rat exhibited poor sociability and high level of anxiety-like behaviors (P <  0.05). In addition, increased level of oxidative stress and inflammation were found by determining different oxido-inflammatory markers. Hesperetin and nano-hesperetin treatment improved the behavioral disorder and reduced the oxidative stress in brain and significantly (p <  0.05) plasma's inflammation indexes. In conclusion, it can be state that nano-hesperetin exerts neuroprotective action in comparison with hesperetin and could be efficacious for treatment of VPA animal model of autism during pregnancy and lactation.\n",

The study was part of the larger New York City (NYC) Korean Community Autism Project, which was designed to identify strategies to increase awareness of autism and reduce delays in treatment seeking within the NYC Korean-American community. Our study elicited early childcare workers' and church leaders' beliefs about autism and developmental disorders and, in particular, early intervention. We also elicited responses to newly developed outreach materials targeting this community. An inductive approach was used to identify concepts and categories associated with autism. Our study confirmed that discomfort, stigma and discrimination are the prevailing community attitudes toward autism and developmental disorders in the Korean-American community. Families' and professionals' understanding of autism and their care for children are affected by these community beliefs. Approaching immigrant communities with general information about child development and education rather than directly talking about autism and developmental disorders is likely to engage more families and professionals in need for diagnostic evaluation and early intervention for autism.\n",

Approximately 34% of the sample presented at least moderate levels, and with 7% presenting severe to extreme levels of hoarding. Child gender predicted hoarding severity. In addition, child ASD-related social difficulties together with attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder symptom severity positively predicted hoarding controlling for child gender and restricted and repetitive behaviors.

      "ABSTRACT The neurobiology of interoception in health and disease.Interoception is the sensing of internal bodily sensations. Interoception is an umbrella term that encompasses (1) the afferent (body-to-brain) signaling through distinct neural and humoral (including immune and endocrine) channels; (2) the neural encoding, representation, and integration of this information concerning internal bodily state; (3) the influence of such information on other perceptions, cognitions, and behaviors; (4) and the psychological expression of these representations as consciously accessible physical sensations and feelings. Interoceptive mechanisms ensure physiological health through the cerebral coordination of homeostatic reflexes and allostatic responses that include motivational behaviors and associated affective and emotional feelings. Furthermore, the conscious, unitary sense of self in time and space may be grounded in the primacy and lifelong continuity of interoception. Body-to-brain interactions influence physical and mental well-being. Consequently, we show that systematic investigation of how individual differences, and within-individual changes, in interoceptive processing can contribute to the mechanistic understanding of physical and psychological disorders. We present a neurobiological overview of interoception and describe how interoceptive impairments at different levels relate to specific physical and mental health conditions, including sickness behaviors and fatigue, depression, eating disorders, autism, and anxiety. We frame these findings in an interoceptive predictive processing framework and highlight potential new avenues for treatments.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Prenatal exposure to environmental insults and enhanced risk of developing Schizophrenia and Autism Spectrum Disorder: focus on biological pathways and epigenetic mechanisms.When considering neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), Schizophrenia (SZ) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are considered to be among the most severe in term of prevalence, morbidity and impact on the society. Similar features and overlapping symptoms have been observed at multiple levels, suggesting common pathophysiological bases. Indeed, recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and epidemiological data report shared vulnerability genes and environmental triggers across the two disorders. In this review, we will discuss the possible biological mechanisms, including glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmissions, inflammatory signals and oxidative stress related systems, which are targeted by adverse environmental exposures and that have been associated with the development of SZ and ASD. We will also discuss the emerging role of the gut microbiome as possible interplay between environment, immune system and brain development. Finally, we will describe the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in the maintenance of long-lasting effects of adverse environments early in life. This will allow us to better understand the pathophysiology of these NDDs, and also to identify novel targets for future treatment strategies.\n",

Here, we conducted a preliminary investigation of the experiences of post-menarcheal autistic (n = 123) and non-autistic (n = 114) respondents to a brief online survey. Although autistic respondents reported many overlapping issues and experiences with non-autistic respondents, they also highlighted distinct-and sometimes-distressing-issues relating to menstruation, especially a cyclical amplification of autistic-related challenges, including sensory differences and difficulties with regulating emotion and behavior, which had a significant, negative impact on their lives. These initial findings call for systematic research on the potential causes, correlates and consequences of menstrual-related problems in autistic individuals-across the spectrum and the lifespan.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Understanding Friendship Sex Heterophily and Relational Characteristics to Optimize the Selection of Peer Models for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.This study used social network analysis to evaluate whether sex heterophily, the degree to which peers are different in sex, between 126 children with autism (ages 5-12 years) and their peers affected social network connectivity. Results indicate that: (1) the quantity and sex of friends were more important in predicting social network connectivity than the relational characteristics of the friends (friendship nominations and social network salience/popularity); and (2) sex heterophily is an important factor in predicting social network connectivity. For males with autism, having friends of the same sex was associated with better social network connectivity; this was not true for females with autism. These findings have important implications for the selection of peer models for elementary-aged children with autism.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Overview of the Recent Advances in Pathophysiology and Treatment for Autism.Autism is a developmental disorder that manifests itself in early childhood. Autism is characterized by inability to acquire social skills, repetitive behaviors and failure of speech and nonverbal communication development. Recent studies have shown that genetic mutations occur in majority of individuals with autism. These mutations cause a variety of disorders that ultimately lead to brain disorders. It is noteworthy that all mutations do not follow the same pattern. They encompass various kinds of mutations. Autism needs to be treated during childhood as untreated patients usually do not progress to the later stages of development. In this regard, many studies have been performed and numerous treatments have been proposed to improve the outcome of this disease.\n",

Previous studies have suggested an association between gluten-related disorder and psychiatric comorbidities. The objective of our current review is to provide a comprehensive review of this association in children and adults. A systematic literature search using MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO from inception to 2018 using terms of &lsquo;celiac disease&rsquo; or &lsquo;gluten-sensitivity-related disorders&rsquo; combined with terms of &lsquo;mental disorders&rsquo; was conducted. A total of 47 articles were included in our review, of which 28 studies were conducted in adults, 11 studies in children and eight studies included both children and adults. The majority of studies were conducted in celiac disease, two studies in non-celiac gluten sensitivity and none in wheat allergy. Enough evidence is currently available supporting the association of celiac disease with depression and, to a lesser extent, with eating disorders. Further investigation is warranted to evaluate the association suggested with other psychiatric disorders. In conclusion, routine surveillance of potential psychiatric manifestations in children and adults with gluten-related disorders should be carried out by the attending physician.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Exploring the neurocognitive basis of episodic recollection in autism.Increasing evidence indicates that the subjective experience of recollection is diminished in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared to neurotypical individuals. The neurocognitive basis of this difference in how past events are re-experienced has been debated and various theoretical accounts have been proposed to date. Although each existing theory may capture particular features of memory in ASD, recent research questions whether any of these explanations are alone sufficient or indeed fully supported. This review first briefly considers the cognitive neuroscience of how episodic recollection operates in the neurotypical population, informing predictions about the encoding and retrieval mechanisms that might function atypically in ASD. We then review existing research on recollection in ASD, which has often not distinguished between different theoretical explanations. Recent evidence suggests a distinct difficulty engaging recollective retrieval processes, specifically the ability to consciously reconstruct and monitor a past experience, which is likely underpinned by altered functional interactions between neurocognitive systems rather than brain region-specific or process-specific dysfunction. This integrative approach serves to highlight how memory research in ASD may enhance our understanding of memory processes and networks in the typical brain. We make suggestions for future research that are important for further specifying the neurocognitive basis of episodic recollection in ASD and linking such difficulties to social developmental and educational outcomes.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Task switching in autism: An EEG study on intentions and actions.One of the main symptoms of Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) is experiencing cognitive inflexibility when adjustments of behaviour are required. While this so-called behavioural rigidity is broadly recognised in ASC, finding evidence for the underlying neurocognitive mechanisms remains challenging. In this electroencephalographic (EEG) study, participants with ASC and matched controls were instructed to choose between two cognitive tasks in each trial, and to respond to the subsequently presented target stimulus according to their task choice. While doing so, we tracked the frontally distributed contingent negative variation (CNV) during the task preparation interval as a measure of intentional control, and the posteriorly measured P3 during the task execution interval to monitor the translation of intentions into actions. The results support the notion of intentional control difficulties in ASC, where the CNV was attenuated in the ASC group compared to the control group. Furthermore, the CNV was differentiated between the tasks and transition types in the control group only, suggesting that the ASC group was less fine-tuning the required amount of intentional control to contextual circumstances. In contrast, the P3 showed no significant differences between the groups. Together, these findings highlight the importance of intentional control mechanisms as a crucial future route for a better understanding of cognitive flexibility and behavioural rigidity in ASC.\n",

In this study, we investigated 23 pediatric subjects (≤ 18 yrs old, both sexes) with ASD, all residents in the city of Campo Grande in Brazil, by searching for their micronutrient levels in plasma in relation with metabolic and nutrition biomarkers. Aside for the few evidence reported, generally, the Brazilian cohort of ASD children here examined did not show a marked difference in micro-nutrient intake in relation with their resident geographical area and their dietary habit or metabolic state, although a slight difference in the levels of magnesium and phosphorus was retrieved due to sex difference.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Caregiver Strategies to Enhance Participation in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder.Participation is necessary for childhood development, however, children with disabilities participate in fewer activities than their nondisabled peers. This study identified strategies caregivers use to increase participation in home- and community-based activities for children with autism spectrum disorder. Survey responses of 44 caregivers were analyzed through open and axial coding to develop a central theme and five broad themes. Caregiver strategies which produce a participation outcome fell into five themes: (a) adapters/facilitators, (b) pragmatic considerations, (c) social reframing, (d) sensory adjustments, and (e) desperate measures. Nonproductive strategies were identified where the child did not participate in the activity. Adaptations/facilitators were more likely used in the home, whereas community-based strategies were more often pragmatic considerations. Nonproductive strategies occurred more frequently in the community. When evaluating a child's participation, occupational therapy (OT) practitioners should take into consideration the context of the activity to identify appropriate and helpful strategies.\n",

Our interneuron-targeting, microRNA-guided neuron tag, \"GABA mAGNET,\" achieves >95% interneuron selective labeling in the mouse cortex, including in a murine model of autism and also some preferential labeling of interneurons in the rat brain. We demonstrate an application of our GABA mAGNET by performing simultaneous, in vivo optogenetic control of two distinct neuron subtypes.

      "ABSTRACT Leptin and camel milk abate oxidative stress status, genotoxicity induced in valproic acid rat model of autism.The aspect of treatment of autistic behaviour was investigated using valproic acid rat model of pregnant female rats. Two main groups (10 male rats/group) were treated for 6 days and then divided into six subgroups. The first group of normal rats was divided into three subgroups: (A) - control group, (B) - treated with camel milk (CAM; 2 mL/p.o) and (C) - treated with leptin (1000 µg/kg i.p) twice daily. The second group of autistic rats was randomly distributed into four subgroups as follows: (D) - positive control (autistics rats), (E) - treated with CAM, (F) - treated with a moderate dose of leptin and (G) - treated with a higher dose of leptin. Autistic behaviours of male offspring were checked by grooming and elevated pulz maze tests. Valproic acid (VPA)-induced autistic rats showed severe changes in oxidative stress markers, neurotransmitters and inflammatory cytokines, besides genotoxic manifestation of expression of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, Bax and caspase-3. Leptin or CAM alone showed no signs of toxicity. CAM showed pronounced improvement in control rats than control itself. Leptin or CAM treatment of autistic animals showed a significant improvement of all measured parameters and genetic expression values. The improvement was pronounced in animals treated with CAM. These results suggest that CAM is a potential therapeutic candidate for autism via regulation of inflammatory and apoptotic pathways. Leptin plays an essential role in alleviation of autistic behaviour through antioxidant effects.\n",

In addition, in various conditions and with neuropsychological disorders, the brain has special patterns in different regions. This paper presents a model to show and compare the connection patterns in different brain regions of children with autism (53 boys and 36 girls) and control children (61 boys and 33 girls). The model is designed by cellular neural networks and it uses the proper features of electroencephalography. The results show that there are significant differences and abnormalities in the left hemisphere, (p < 0.05) at the electrodes AF3, F3, P7, T7, and O1 in the children with autism compared with the control group. Also, the evaluation of the obtained connections values between brain regions demonstrated that there are more abnormalities in the connectivity of frontal and parietal lobes and the relations of the neighboring regions in children with autism. It is observed that the proposed model is able to distinguish the autistic children from the control subjects with an accuracy rate of 95.1% based on the obtained values of CNN using the SVM method.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Age, Disease, and Their Interaction Effects on Intrinsic Connectivity of Children and Adolescents in Autism Spectrum Disorder Using Functional Connectomics.Brain connectivity analysis has provided crucial insights to pinpoint the differences between autistic and typically developing (TD) children during development. The aim of this study is to investigate the functional connectomics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) versus TD and underpin the effects of development, disease, and their interactions on the observed atypical brain connectivity patterns. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) data set, which is stratified into two cohorts: children (9-12 years) and adolescents (13-16 years), is used for the analysis. Differences in various graph theoretical network measures are calculated between ASD and TD in each group. Furthermore, two-factor analysis of variance test is used to study the effect of age, disease, and their interaction on the network measures and the network edges. Furthermore, the differences in connection strength between TD and ASD subjects are assessed using network-based statistics. The results showed that ASD exhibits increased functional integration at the expense of decreased functional segregation. In ASD adolescents, there is a significant decrease in modularity suggesting a less robust modular organization, and an increase in participation coefficient suggesting more random integration and widely distributed connection edges. Furthermore, there is significant hypoconnectivity observed in the adolescent group especially in the default mode network, while the children group shows both hyper- and hypoconnectivity. This study lends support to a model of global atypical connections and further identifies functional networks and areas that are independently affected by age, disease, and their interaction.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Neurobiology, not artifacts: Challenges and guidelines for imaging the high risk infant.The search for the brain-basis of atypical development in human infants is challenging because the process of imaging and the generation of the MR signal itself relies on assumptions that reflect biophysical properties of the brain tissue. These assumptions are not inviolate, have been questioned by recent empirical evidence from high risk infant-sibling studies, and to date remain largely underexamined at the between-group level. In particular, I consider recent work showing that infants at High vs. Low familial risk (HR vs. LR, respectively) for developing Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) have atypical patterns of head movements during an MR scan that are functionally important-they are linked to future learning trajectories in toddlerhood. Addressing head movement issues in neuroimaging analyses in infant research as well as understanding the causes of these movements from a developmental perspective requires acknowledging the complexity of this endeavor. For example, head movement signatures in infants can interact with experimental task conditions (such as listening to language compared to sleeping), autism risk, and age. How can new knowledge about newborns' individual, subject-specific behavioral differences which may impact MR signal acquisition and statistical inference ignite critical thinking for the field of infant brain imaging across the spectrum of typical and atypical development? Early behavioral differences between HR and LR infant cohorts that are often examples of \"artifactual\" confounds in MR work provide insight into nascent neurobiological differences, including biophysical tissue properties and hemodynamic response variability, in these and related populations at risk for atypical development. Are these neurobiological drivers of atypical development? This work identifies important knowledge gaps and suggests guidelines at the leading edge of baby imaging science to transform our understanding of atypical brain development in humans. The precise study of the neurobiological underpinnings of atypical development in humans calls for approaches including quantitative MRI (qMRI) pulse sequences, multi-modal imaging (including DTI, MRS, as well as MEG), and infant-specific HRF shapes when modeling BOLD signal.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Investigating the perception of face identity in adults on the autism spectrum using behavioural and electrophysiological measures.In the present study, we investigated face processing in individuals with self-reported Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD, n = 16) and typically developing control participants (n = 16) using behavioural and electrophysiological measures. As a measure of their face memory, we administered the Cambridge Face Memory Test to participants in the ASD group. The results showed that the scores of the ASD participants were reliably below the age- and gender-matched norms of neurotypical individuals. To measure brain responses to faces, we used the fast periodic visual stimulation method, presenting photographs of a same-identity face (i.e., base face) at a constant frequency of 6 Hz (F) interleaved with different-identity faces (i.e., the oddball faces) presented at 1.2 Hz. The 6 Hz presentation of the base face and 1.2 Hz presentation of the oddball face elicited periodic brain responses corresponding to face detection and face individuation processes, respectively. Participants viewed four blocks of upright faces and four blocks of inverted faces. The results showed an enhanced EEG response to upright base faces at 6 Hz frequency and its harmonics compared to inverted faces, and the response was most focal over medial occipital channels. An enhanced response was found to upright oddball faces at 1.2 Hz and its harmonics compared to the inverted faces, and the response was centred over occipito-temporal channels in the right hemisphere. Critically, no differences or interactions were found between the ASD and typically developing groups in the responses to either the 6 Hz base faces or the 1.2 oddball faces. These results suggest that in individuals with ASD, the earlier stage of face perception, as measured by the fast periodic visual stimulation paradigm, can be dissociated from the later memory stage of face processing, as assessed by the Cambridge Face Memory Test.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Aberrant hemodynamic responses in autism: Implications for resting state fMRI functional connectivity studies.Functional MRI (fMRI) is modeled as a convolution of the hemodynamic response function (HRF) and an unmeasured latent neural signal. However, HRF itself is variable across brain regions and subjects. This variability is induced by both neural and non-neural factors. Aberrations in underlying neurochemical mechanisms, which control HRF shape, have been reported in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Therefore, we hypothesized that this will lead to voxel-specific, yet systematic differences in HRF shape between ASD and healthy controls. As a corollary, we also hypothesized that such alterations will lead to differences in estimated functional connectivity in fMRI space compared to latent neural space. To test these hypotheses, we performed blind deconvolution of resting-state fMRI time series acquired from large number of ASD and control subjects obtained from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) database (N = 1102). Many brain regions previously implicated in autism showed systematic differences in HRF shape in ASD. Specifically, we found that precuneus had aberrations in all HRF parameters. Consequently, we obtained precuneus-seed-based functional connectivity differences between ASD and controls using fMRI as well as using latent neural signals. We found that non-deconvolved fMRI data failed to detect group differences in connectivity between precuneus and certain brain regions that were instead observed in deconvolved data. Our results are relevant for the understanding of hemodynamic and neurochemical aberrations in ASD, as well as have methodological implications for resting-state functional connectivity studies in Autism, and more generally in disorders that are accompanied by neurochemical alterations that may impact HRF shape.\n",

Eighteen children with ASD and 19 age- and IQ-matched typically developing (TD) children were presented with semantically-congruent and incongruent picture-sound pairs, and in separate tasks were instructed to attend to only visual or both audio-visual sensory channels. Preliminary results showed that when required to attend to both modalities, both groups were equally slowed for semantically-incongruent compared to congruent pairs. However, when asked to attend to only visual information, children with ASD were disproportionally slowed by incongruent auditory information, suggesting that they may have more difficulty filtering task-irrelevant cross-modal information. Correlational analyses showed that this inefficient cross-modal attentional filtering was related to greater sociocommunicative impairment.\n",

In Rett syndrome, prevalence rates of 43.6-50% were reported for ataxia and 27.3-48.3% for tremor with additional reports of dystonia, rigidity and pyramidal signs. However, reliable assessment measures were rarely used and recruitment was often not described in sufficient detail.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Mouse models of maternal immune activation: Mind your caging system!Rodent models of maternal immune activation (MIA) are increasingly used as experimental tools to study neuronal and behavioral dysfunctions in relation to infection-mediated neurodevelopmental disorders. One of the most widely used MIA models is based on gestational administration of poly(I:C) (= polyriboinosinic-polyribocytdilic acid), a synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA that induces a cytokine-associated viral-like acute phase response. The effects of poly(I:C)-induced MIA on phenotypic changes in the offspring are known to be influenced by various factors, including the precise prenatal timing, genetic background, and immune stimulus intensity. Thus far, however, it has been largely ignored whether differences in the basic type of laboratory housing can similarly affect the outcomes of MIA models. Here, we examined this possibility by comparing the poly(I:C)-based MIA model in two housing systems that are commonly used in preclinical mouse research, namely the open cage (OC) and individually ventilated cage (IVC) systems. Pregnant C57BL6/N mice were kept in OCs or IVCs and treated with a low (1 mg/kg, i.v.) or high (5 mg/kg, i.v.) dose of poly(I:C), or with control vehicle solution. MIA or control treatment was induced on gestation day (GD) 9 or 12, and the resulting offspring were raised and maintained in OCs or IVCs until adulthood for behavioral testing. An additional cohort of dams was used to assess the influence of the different caging systems on poly(I:C)-induced cytokine and stress responses in the maternal plasma. Maternal poly(I:C) administration on GD9 caused a dose-dependent increase in spontaneous abortion in IVCs but not in OCs, whereas MIA in IVC systems during a later gestational time-point (GD12) did not affect pregnancy outcomes. Moreover, the precise type of caging system markedly affected maternal cytokines and chemokines at basal states and in response to poly(I:C) and further influenced the maternal levels of the stress hormone, corticosterone. The efficacy of MIA to induce deficits in working memory, social interaction, and sensorimotor gating in the adult offspring was influenced by the different housing conditions, the dosing of poly(I:C), and the precise prenatal timing. Taken together, the present study identifies the basic type of caging system as a novel factor that can confound the outcomes of MIA in mice. Our findings thus urge the need to consider and report the kind of laboratory housing systems used to implement MIA models. Providing this information seems pivotal to yield reproducible results in these models.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Ex-Gaussian, Frequency and Reward Analyses Reveal Specificity of Reaction Time Fluctuations to ADHD and Not Autism Traits.Both attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been linked to increased reaction time variability (RTV), a marker of attentional fluctuation. Here we test whether specificity to either trait emerges when we examine (1) detailed ex-Gaussian and frequency RTV subcomponents, (2) effects while controlling for the other trait and (3) improvement in the RTV measures following rewards or a faster event rate. 1110 children aged 7-10 years from a population-based sample completed a Go/No-Go task under three conditions (slow, fast and incentives). We measured RTV with standard deviation of RT (SDRT), ex-Gaussian distribution measures (Sigma and Tau), RT fluctuations in cycles of ~14-90 s in all conditions (Slow-4 and Slow-5), and RT fluctuations in cycles of 2-14 s in the fast condition (Slow-2 and Slow-3). Parent-rated ADHD and ASD traits were obtained. All refined RTV components were linked to ADHD traits only and not to ASD traits, while Sigma did not relate to either trait. Although both ADHD and ASD social-communication traits were associated with SDRT, the association with social-communication impairments disappeared when controlling for ADHD traits. A reward-induced improvement in RTV measures, indicating malleability, emerged in relation to ADHD traits but not ASD traits. Under closer inspection, specificity emerges of high RTV to ADHD traits. For the clinician, our findings indicate that attentional fluctuation in children with high ASD traits may be due to co-occurring ADHD traits and emphasise how the effectiveness of rewards does not generalise from ADHD to ASD traits.\n",

Several methods exist to correct for misclassification error. One approach is to use point estimates for the sensitivity (Sn) and specificity (Sp) of the tool used for exposure assessment. Unfortunately, we typically do not know the Sn and Sp with certainty. Bayesian methods for exposure misclassification correction allow us to model this uncertainty via distributions for Sn and Sp. These methods have been applied in epidemiologic literature, but are not considered a mainstream approach, especially in occupational epidemiology.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Stem Cells to Inform the Neurobiology of Mental Illness.The inception of human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSCs) technology has provided an exciting platform upon which the modelling and treatment of human neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders may be expedited. Although the genetic architecture of these disorders is far more complex than previously imagined, many key loci have at last been identified. This has allowed in vivo and in vitro technologies to be refined to model specific high-penetrant genetic loci involved in both disorders. Animal models of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders, show limitations in recapitulating the full complexity and heterogeneity of human neurodevelopmental disease states. Indeed, patient-derived hiPSCs offer distinct advantages over classical animal models in the study of human neuropathologies. Here we have discussed the current, relative translational merit of hiPSCs in investigating human neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders with a specific emphasis on the utility of such systems to aid in the identification of biomarkers. We have highlighted the promises and pitfalls of reprogramming cell fate for the study of these disorders and provide recommendations for future directions in this field in order to overcome current limitations. Ultimately, this will aid in the development of effective clinical strategies for diverse patient populations affected by these disorders with the aim of also leading to biomarker identification.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Nanoparticle formulations that allow for sustained delivery and brain targeting of the neuropeptide oxytocin.Oxytocin is a promising candidate for the treatment of social-deficit disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder, but oxytocin cannot readily pass the blood-brain barrier. Moreover, oxytocin requires frequent dosing as it is rapidly metabolized in blood. We fabricated four polymeric nanoparticle formulations using poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) or bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the base material. In order to target them to the brain, we then conjugated the materials to either transferrin or rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG) as targeting ligands. The formulations were characterized in vitro for size, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency, and release profiles. All formulations showed slightly negative charges and sizes ranging from 100 to 278 nm in diameter, with RVG-conjugated BSA nanoparticles exhibiting the smallest sizes. No formulation was found to be immunogenic or cytotoxic. The encapsulation efficiency was ≥75% for all nanoparticle formulations. Release studies demonstrated that BSA nanoparticle formulation exhibited a faster initial burst of release compared to PLGA particles, in addition to later sustained release. This initial burst release would be favorable for clinical dosing as therapeutic effects could be quickly established, especially in combination with additional sustained release to maintain the therapeutic effects. Our size and release profile data indicate that RVG-conjugated BSA nanoparticles are the most favorable formulation for brain delivery of oxytocin.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Prior depressive symptoms and persistent child problem behaviours predict future depression in parents of children with developmental disabilities: The growing up in Ireland cohort study.Predictors of depression over time were examined in parental carers of children with developmental disabilities (DD) and parents of typically developing children (controls) who participated in the Growing up in Ireland Study. Parents completed measures of depression, the Centre for Epidemiological Depression Scale (CES-D) and child problem behaviours, the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire when the children were aged 9 (Wave 1) and 13 (Wave 2). Using CES-D cut-off scores to indicate probable depression, caregivers were more likely to be depressed at both waves compared to controls with a Wave 1 rate of depression of 14.6% vs. 7.9% (p < 0.001, Cramer`s V = 0.059) and Wave 2 (14.8% vs. 10%, p = 0.003, Cramer`s V = 0.038). While overall rates of depression were stable for caregivers, a shifting pattern emerged; 59.6% of those who were depressed at Wave 1, were not at Wave 2; similarly, 10.9% who were not depressed at Wave 1, were at Wave 2. Parents of children with DD were also more likely to report greater problem behaviours in their children compared to controls at both waves. Depression in caregivers at Wave 1 and persistent child problem behaviours were significant predictors of depression at Wave 2. In conclusion, while overall rates of depression remain stable in caregivers, there are shifting patterns evident with prior depression and persistent behaviour problems predictive of ongoing depression.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Neural correlates of taste reactivity in autism spectrum disorder.Selective or 'picky' eating habits are common among those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). These behaviors are often related to aberrant sensory experience in individuals with ASD, including heightened reactivity to food taste and texture. However, very little is known about the neural mechanisms that underlie taste reactivity in ASD. In the present study, food-related neural responses were evaluated in 21 young adult and adolescent males diagnosed with ASD without intellectual disability, and 21 typically-developing (TD) controls. Taste reactivity was assessed using the Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile, a clinical self-report measure. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to evaluate hemodynamic responses to sweet (vs. neutral) tastants and food pictures. Subjects also underwent resting-state functional connectivity scans.The ASD and TD individuals did not differ in their hemodynamic response to gustatory stimuli. However, the ASD subjects, but not the controls, exhibited a positive association between self-reported taste reactivity and the response to sweet tastants within the insular cortex and multiple brain regions associated with gustatory perception and reward. There was a strong interaction between diagnostic group and taste reactivity on tastant response in brain regions associated with ASD pathophysiology, including the bilateral anterior superior temporal sulcus (STS). This interaction of diagnosis and taste reactivity was also observed in the resting state functional connectivity between the anterior STS and dorsal mid-insula (i.e., gustatory cortex).These results suggest that self-reported heightened taste reactivity in ASD is associated with heightened brain responses to food-related stimuli and atypical functional connectivity of primary gustatory cortex, which may predispose these individuals to maladaptive and unhealthy patterns of selective eating behavior.\n",

Mothers of approximately 10,000 children participating in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children rated child temperament. Stability coefficients for child temperament scales were medium to large, and stability was generally robust across moderators except child gender and birth order and mother age and education, which had small moderating effects on reports of stability of child temperament.

      "ABSTRACT Comparing fully automated state-of-the-art cerebellum parcellation from magnetic resonance images.The human cerebellum plays an essential role in motor control, is involved in cognitive function (i.e., attention, working memory, and language), and helps to regulate emotional responses. Quantitative in-vivo assessment of the cerebellum is important in the study of several neurological diseases including cerebellar ataxia, autism, and schizophrenia. Different structural subdivisions of the cerebellum have been shown to correlate with differing pathologies. To further understand these pathologies, it is helpful to automatically parcellate the cerebellum at the highest fidelity possible. In this paper, we coordinated with colleagues around the world to evaluate automated cerebellum parcellation algorithms on two clinical cohorts showing that the cerebellum can be parcellated to a high accuracy by newer methods. We characterize these various methods at four hierarchical levels: coarse (i.e., whole cerebellum and gross structures), lobe, subdivisions of the vermis, and the lobules. Due to the number of labels, the hierarchy of labels, the number of algorithms, and the two cohorts, we have restricted our analyses to the Dice measure of overlap. Under these conditions, machine learning based methods provide a collection of strategies that are efficient and deliver parcellations of a high standard across both cohorts, surpassing previous work in the area. In conjunction with the rank-sum computation, we identified an overall winning method.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Altered Gamma Oscillations during Motor Control in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.Autism is hypothesized to result in a cortical excitatory and inhibitory imbalance driven by inhibitory interneuron dysfunction, which is associated with the generation of gamma oscillations. On the other hand, impaired motor control has been widely reported in autism. However, no study has focused on the gamma oscillations during motor control in autism. In the present study, we investigated the motor-related gamma oscillations in autism using magnetoencephalography. Magnetoencephalographic signals were recorded from 14 right-handed human children with autism (5 female), aged 5-7 years, and age- and IQ-matched 15 typically developing children during a motor task using their right index finger. Consistent with previous studies, the autism group showed a significantly longer button response time and reduced amplitude of motor-evoked magnetic fields. We observed that the autism group exhibited a low peak frequency of motor-related gamma oscillations from the contralateral primary motor cortex, and these were associated with the severity of autism symptoms. The autism group showed a reduced power of motor-related gamma oscillations in the bilateral primary motor cortex. A linear discriminant analysis using the button response time and gamma oscillations showed a high classification performance (86.2% accuracy). The alterations of the gamma oscillations in autism might reflect the cortical excitatory and inhibitory imbalance. Our findings provide an important clue into the behavioral and neurophysiological alterations in autism and a potential biomarker for autism.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Sex: A Significant Risk Factor for Neurodevelopmental and Neurodegenerative Disorders.Males and females sometimes significantly differ in their propensity to develop neurological disorders. Females suffer more from mood disorders such as depression and anxiety, whereas males are more susceptible to deficits in the dopamine system including Parkinson's disease (PD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism. Despite this, biological sex is rarely considered when making treatment decisions in neurological disorders. A better understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) underlying sex differences in the healthy and diseased brain will help to devise diagnostic and therapeutic strategies optimal for each sex. Thus, the aim of this review is to discuss the available evidence on sex differences in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders regarding prevalence, progression, symptoms and response to therapy. We also discuss the sex-related factors such as gonadal sex hormones and sex chromosome genes and how these might help to explain some of the clinically observed sex differences in these disorders. In particular, we highlight the emerging role of the Y-chromosome gene,\n",

      "ABSTRACT Relationship Between Theory of Mind, Emotion Recognition, and Social Synchrony in Adolescents With and Without Autism.Difficulty in social communication and interaction is a primary diagnostic feature of ASD. Research has found that adolescents with ASD display various impairments in social behavior such as theory of mind (ToM), emotion recognition, and social synchrony. However, not much is known about the relationships among these dimensions of social behavior. Adolescents with and without ASD participated in the study. ToM ability was measured by viewing social animations of geometric shapes, recognition of facial emotions was measured by viewing pictures of faces, and synchrony ability was measured with a spontaneously arising interpersonal movement task completed with a caregiver and an intentional interpersonal task. Attention and social responsiveness were measured using parent reports. We then examined the relationship between ToM, emotion recognition, clinical measures of attention and social responsiveness, and social synchronization that arises either spontaneously or intentionally. Results indicate that spontaneous synchrony was related to ToM and intentional synchrony was related to clinical measures of attention and social responsiveness. Facial emotion recognition was not related to either ToM or social synchrony. Our findings highlight the importance of biological motion perception and production and attention for more fully understanding the social behavior characteristic of ASD. The findings suggest that the processes underlying difficulties in spontaneous synchrony in ASD are different than the processes underlying difficulties in intentional synchronization.\n",

We performed a large-scale retrospective analysis of 1,996 structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations of the brain from 1,769 autistic and neurologically typically developing patients (aged 0-32 years), and extracted regional volumetric measurements distributed across 463 brain regions of each patient. The youngest autistic patients (<2.5 years) were diagnosed after imaging and identified retrospectively. Our study demonstrates corpus callosum volumetric abnormalities among autistic patients that are associated with brain overgrowth in early childhood (0-5 years old), followed by a shift towards known decreased volumes in later ages. Results confirm known increases in ventricular volumes among autistic populations and extends those findings to increased volumes of the choroid plexus.

Early diagnostic criteria are as follows: less responsive to social stimuli, inability to develop natural speaking skills, lack of communication skills, and limited and repetitive behaviors. Orthodontic treatment is a challenging process for doctors in autistic patients. The clinical and cephalometric examination of a 17-year and 7-month-old autistic patient revealed class I malocclusion, increased vertical dimensions, proclined upper and lower incisors, and inconsistent lip closure. The treatment plan involved four premolar extractions from each quadrant. Upper and lower 1. premolar extraction with fixed treatment caused reduction in vertical dimensions and significant improvement in lip closure and incisor inclination. Due to the increased metabolic activity in these patients, treatment was completed in 13 months. As a result, autistic patients can be successfully treated. In this process, it is important to include communication as a major part of treatment.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The Use of Multi-parametric Biomarker Profiles May Increase the Accuracy of ASD Prediction.Effective biomarkers are urgently needed to facilitate early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), permitting early intervention, and consequently improving prognosis. In this study, we evaluate the usefulness of nine biomarkers and their association (combination) in predicting ASD onset and development. Data were analyzed using multiple independent mathematical and statistical approaches to verify the suitability of obtained results as predictive parameters. All biomarkers tested appeared useful in predicting ASD, particularly vitamin E, glutathione-S-transferase, and dopamine. Combining biomarkers into profiles improved the accuracy of ASD prediction but still failed to distinguish between participants with severe versus mild or moderate ASD. Library-based identification was effective in predicting the occurrence of disease. Due to the small sample size and wide participant age variation in this study, we conclude that the use of multi-parametric biomarker profiles directly related to autism phenotype may help predict the disease occurrence more accurately, but studies using larger, more age-homogeneous populations are needed to corroborate our findings.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Parent descriptions of the presentation and management of anxiousness in children on the autism spectrum.The complex interaction between anxiety and autism has led to debate about the presentation of anxiety in individuals on the spectrum and questions about the extent to which traditional checklists assess the entire range of symptomatology. Moreover, studies to date have not explored how the presentation of anxiety may differ between settings. Through a combination of open-ended questions, closed questions and standardised measures, parents of 173 children (aged 6-13) on the autism spectrum provided (1) descriptors of their child's anxiety at home, school and in the community and (2) strategies used to reduce their child's anxiety in each setting. Over half (52.6%) felt their child was anxious at home, 77.6% at school and 76.2% in the community. Parents reported differing presentations of anxiety between settings, with the majority of descriptions relating to observable, behavioural changes (e.g. hides/shuts down, repetitive behaviours) rather than cognitive or physiological signs. Parents also reported using different strategies across settings. The use of open-ended questions allowed the identification of signs of anxiety not explored within traditional questionnaires and highlighted the potential for signs to vary across settings. This knowledge is critical to inform the development or adaptations of anxiety measures and interventions.\n",

      "ABSTRACT A comparison of the Avisoft (5.2) and Ultravox (2.0) recording systems: Implications for early-life communication and vocalization research.Alterations in early-life communicative behaviors are a common feature of neurodevelopmental conditions, such as autism and epilepsy. One method of investigating communication in murine models is through analyzing ultrasonic vocalizations. These vocalizations are commonly recorded with either the Avisoft or the Ultravox recording programs. However, since no study has compared whether the systems are equally sensitive, the findings in one program may not be reproducible in the other. To directly compare the two programs, we elicited vocalizations from male and female 129SvEvTac and C57BL/6 mouse pups via the maternal isolation paradigm, recording vocalizations simultaneously with both systems. We held the detection parameters identical for each system and found that there was only a medium correlation between Avisoft and Ultravox overall. Further analysis indicated that Avisoft detected more total vocalizations, as well as more vocalizations at the set frequencies of 50, 60, and 70 kHz than Ultravox, p <  .05. No statistically significant difference was present at 80 kHz. These findings demonstrate that different recording systems do not detect the same quantity of vocalizations as one another, even when detection parameters are congruent. Therefore, it may be useful to revisit previous negative results obtained with Ultravox and repeat the experiments using Avisoft. Ultimately, ultrasonic vocalizations are a valuable tool, capable of examining early-life phenotypes. However, a more thorough understanding of the relationships between recording systems is necessary to achieve a more comprehensive and reproducible assessment of vocalizing behaviors.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The Perineuronal 'Safety' Net? Perineuronal Net Abnormalities in Neurological Disorders.Perineuronal nets (PNN) are extracellular matrix (ECM) assemblies that preferentially ensheath parvalbumin (PV) expressing interneurons. Converging evidence indicates that PV cells and PNN are impaired in a variety of neurological disorders. PNN development and maintenance is necessary for a number of processes within the CNS, including regulation of GABAergic cell function, protection of neurons from oxidative stress, and closure of developmental critical period plasticity windows. Understanding PNN functions may be essential for characterizing the mechanisms of altered cortical excitability observed in neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders. Indeed, PNN abnormalities have been observed in post-mortem brain tissues of patients with schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. There is impaired development of PNNs and enhanced activity of its key regulator matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in Fragile X Syndrome, a common genetic cause of autism. MMP-9, a protease that cleaves ECM, is differentially regulated in a number of these disorders. Despite this, few studies have addressed the interactions between PNN expression, MMP-9 activity and neuronal excitability. In this review, we highlight the current evidence for PNN abnormalities in CNS disorders associated with altered network function and MMP-9 levels, emphasizing the need for future work targeting PNNs in pathophysiology and therapeutic treatment of neurological disorders.\n",

This paper used the wavelet transform and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to extract the features of electroencephalogram (EEG), to compare the feature differences of EEG between the autistic children and healthy children. The experimental subjects included 25 healthy children (aged 5-10 years old) and 25 children with autism (20 boys and 5 girls aged 5-10 years old) respectively. The alpha, beta, theta and delta rhythm wave spectra of the C3, C4, F3, F4, F7, F8, FP1, FP2, O1, O2, P3, P4, T3, T4, T5 and T6 channels were extracted and decomposed by EMD decomposition to obtain the intrinsic modal functions. Finally the support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used to implement assessment of autism and normal classification. The results showed that the accuracy could reach 87% and which was nearly 20% higher than that of the model combining the wavelet transform and sample entropy in the paper. Moreover, the accuracy of delta (1-4 Hz) rhythm wave was the highest among the four kinds of rhythms. And the classification accuracy of the forehead F7 channel, left FP1 channel and T6 channel in the temporal region were all up to 90%, which expressed the characteristics of EEG signals in autistic children better.\n",

We hypothesized that an ASD profile in children characterized by mild delays and increased rates of dysregulation would be associated with preexisting maternal anxiety or depression. Participants were 672 preschool children with ASD and their mothers. Children were classified as ASD after a comprehensive developmental evaluation. Mothers reported whether a healthcare provider ever diagnosed them with anxiety or depression before the birth of their child. Four child ASD phenotypes were derived from latent class analysis: Mild Language Delay with Cognitive Rigidity (Type 1), Significant Developmental Delay with Repetitive Motor Behaviors (Type 2), General Developmental Delay (Type 3), and Mild Language and Motor Delay with Dysregulation (i.e., aggression, anxiety, depression, emotional reactivity, inattention, somatic complaints, and sleep problems) (Type 4). Type 2 ASD served as the referent category in statistical analyses. Results showed that 22.6% of mothers reported a diagnosis of anxiety or depression before the birth of their child. Maternal anxiety or depression was associated with 2.7 times the odds (95% confidence interval: 1.4, 5.3) of Type 4 or Dysregulated ASD in the child; maternal anxiety and depression was associated with 4.4 times the odds (95% confidence interval: 1.4, 14.0) of Type 4 or Dysregulated ASD in the child. Our findings suggest an association between Dysregulated ASD in the child and anxiety and depression in the mother.

      "ABSTRACT Juvenile Shank3b deficient mice present with behavioral phenotype relevant to autism spectrum disorder.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a pervasive, multifactorial neurodevelopmental disorder diagnosed according to deficits in three behavioral domains: communication, social interaction, and stereotyped/repetitive behaviors. Mutations in Shank genes account for ∼1% of clinical ASD cases with Shank3 being the most common gene variant. In addition to maintaining synapses and facilitating dendritic maturation, Shank genes encode master scaffolding proteins that build core complexes in the postsynaptic densities of glutamatergic synapses. Male mice with a deletion of the PDZ domain of Shank3 (Shank3B KO) were previously shown to display ASD-like behavioral phenotypes with reported self-injurious repetitive grooming and aberrant social interactions. Our goal was to extend these previous findings and use a comprehensive battery of highly detailed ASD-relevant behavioral assays including an assessment of mouse ultrasonic communication carried out on key developmental days and male and female Shank3B KO mice. We demonstrate that ASD-related behaviors, atypical reciprocal social interaction and indiscriminate repetitive grooming, are apparent in juvenile stages of development of Shank3B KO mice. Our findings underscore the importance of utilizing Shank mutant models to understand the impact of this gene in ASD etiology, whichmay enable future studies focusing on etiological gene-environment interactions in ASD.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Regeneration of neurotransmission transcriptome in a model of epileptic encephalopathy after antiinflammatory treatment.Inflammation is an established etiopathogenesis factor of infantile spasms (IS), a therapy-resistant epileptic syndrome of infancy. We investigated the IS-associated transcriptomic alterations of neurotransmission in rat hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, how they are corrected by antiinflamatory treatments and whether there are sex differences. IS was triggered by repeated intraperitoneal administration of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid following anti-inflammatory treatment (adreno-cortico-tropic-hormone (ACTH) or PMX53) or normal saline vehicle to prenatally exposed to betamethasone young rats. We found that treatments with both ACTH and PMX53 resulted in substantial recovery of the genomic fabrics of all types of synaptic transmission altered by IS. While ACTH represents the first line of treatment for IS, the even higher efficiency of PMX53 (an antagonist of the complement C5a receptor) in restoring the normal transcriptome was not expected. In addition to the childhood epilepsy, the recovery of the neurotransmission genomic fabrics by PMX53 also gives hope for the autism spectrum disorders that share a high comorbidity with IS. Our results revealed significant sex dichotomy in both IS-associated transcriptomic alterations (males more affected) and in the efficiency of PMX53 anti-inflammatory treatment (better for males). Our data further suggest that anti-inflammatory treatments correcting alterations in the inflammatory transcriptome may become successful therapies for refractory epilepsies.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Induced pluripotent stem cells as a tool to study brain circuits in autism-related disorders.The mammalian brain is a very complex organ containing an estimated 200 billion cells in humans. Therefore, studying human brain development has become very challenging given all the data that are available from different approaches, notably genetic studies.Recent pluripotent stem cell methods have given rise to the possibility of modeling neurodevelopmental diseases associated with genetic defects. Fibroblasts from patients have been reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells to derive appropriate neuronal lineages. They specifically include different subtypes of cortical neurons that are at the core of human-specific cognitive abilities. The use of neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) has led to deciphering convergent and pleiotropic neuronal synaptic phenotypes found in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and their associated syndromes. In addition to these initial studies, remarkable progress has been made in the field of stem cells, with the major objective of reproducing the in vivo maturation steps of human neurons. Recently, several studies have demonstrated the ability of human progenitors to respond to guidance cues and signals in vivo that can direct neurons to their appropriate sites of differentiation where they become fully mature neurons.We provide a brief overview on research using human iPSC in ASD and associated syndromes and on the current understanding of new theories using the re-implantation of neural precursors in mouse brain.\n",

Here, we report two cases of KMT2A-rearranged infantile AML masquerading as JMML at initial presentation. Both cases showed leukocytosis accompanied by atypical monocytosis. However, in both cases, leukemic blasts were absent at the initial examination. Thus, a diagnosis of JMML was suspected. However, initial cytogenetic analysis revealed that both cases had an 11q23 rearrangement, which is atypical in JMML. Eventually, due to the emergence of leukemic blasts and further cytogenetic studies, both cases were diagnosed with infantile AML with a KMT2A rearrangement. Although one patient remains in complete remission after the completion of AML appropriate chemotherapy, the other died of AML due to treatment failure. Our experience suggests that AML with KMT2A rearrangement should be considered for the differential diagnosis of infantile cases with atypical monocytosis suggestive of JMML. Cytogenetic studies, including fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of KMT2A, may be helpful in distinguishing between AML with KMT2A rearrangement and JMML.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Dysregulated enzymatic antioxidant network in peripheral neutrophils and monocytes in children with autism.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder where immune cells play an important role. Oxidants and pro-inflammatory cytokines generated by innate immune cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ASD. Many previous reports have shown the role of various enzymatic antioxidants in the plasma/red blood cells of ASD subjects, however no study so far has evaluated them in peripheral immune cells of innate origin (neutrophils and monocytes) in ASD patients and typically developing control (TDC) children. With this background, our study explored the expression and activities of major enzymatic antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR) in peripheral neutrophils and monocytes of TDC/ASD subjects. Our data show that expression and activity of SOD is increased in ASD subjects as compared to TDC children in neutrophils and monocytes. On the other hand, GPx/GR activity is either reduced/unaltered in neutrophils and monocytes of ASD subjects as compared to TDC children. Increased SOD expression is associated with upregulated expression of nitrotyrosine (a marker of oxidant damage) in both innate immune cells of ASD subjects. Our study suggests that despite adaptive antioxidant response, there is an increased oxidative burden in peripheral neutrophils and monocytes of ASD subjects. This suggests that dysregulated enzymatic antioxidant network in peripheral innate immune cells could play a significant role in the pathogenesis of autism.\n",

We investigated longitudinal predictors of reading skills in 41 children diagnosed with ASD. All children completed measures of precursor literacy skills at the age of 4-5 years, including phonological awareness, letter sound knowledge, rapid automatic naming, name writing, and phonological memory (digit span), along with measures of word- and passage-level reading skills in their first year of formal schooling. Nonverbal cognition and letter sound knowledge accounted for 53.4% of the variance in regular single word reading at school age, with letter sound knowledge a significant individual predictor. Overall, 18 children showed reading ability scores in the average range on a standardized test of passage-level reading ability, whereas 23 children performed below expectations. These groups differed significantly on all precursor literacy measures (at ages 4-5), except autism symptoms based on parent report. Group membership was significantly predicted by preschool receptive vocabulary, name writing, and rapid automatic naming, with high sensitivity and specificity. These results are discussed in reference to the literature describing early literacy predictors for typically developing children, highlighting key areas for future intervention and support.

      "ABSTRACT A unified circuit for social behavior.Recent advances in circuit manipulation technologies have enabled the association of distinct neural circuits with complex social behaviors. The brain areas identified through historical anatomical characterizations as mediators of sexual and parental behaviors can now be functionally linked to adult social behaviors within a unified circuit. In vivo electrophysiology, optogenetics and chemogenetics have been used to follow the processing of social sensory stimuli from perception by the olfactory system to valence detection by the amygdala and mesolimbic dopamine system to integration by the cerebral and cerebellar cortices under modulation of hypothalamic neuropeptides. Further, these techniques have been able to identify the distinct functional changes induced by social as opposed to non-social stimuli. Together this evidence suggests that there is a distinct, functionally coupled circuit that is selectively activated by social stimuli. A unified social circuit provides a new framework against which synaptopathic autism related mutations can be considered and novel pharmacotherapeutic strategies can be developed.\n",

Arid1b heterozygous mice also display significant cortical excitatory/inhibitory imbalance due to altered GABAergic neuron numbers and impaired inhibitory synaptic transmission. Abnormal epigenetic modifications, including histone acetylation and methylation, are additionally associated with Arid1b haploinsufficiency in the brain. Treating adult Arid1b mutant mice with a positive GABA allosteric modulator, however, rescues multiple behavioral abnormalities, such as cognitive and social impairments, as well as elevated anxiety. While treating Arid1b haploinsufficient mice with recombinant mouse growth hormone successfully increases body size, it has no effect on aberrant behavior. Here we summarize the recent findings regarding the role of ARID1B in brain development and behavior and discuss the utility of the Arid1b heterozygous mouse model in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric research. We also discuss some of the opportunities and potential challenges in developing translational applications for humans and possible avenues for further research into the mechanisms of ARID1B pathology in the brain.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Visually Evoked Response Differences to Contrast and Motion in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.High-density electroencephalography (EEG) was used to examine the utility of the P1 event-related potential (ERP) as a marker of visual motion sensitivity to luminance defined low-spatial frequency drifting gratings in 16 children with autism and 16 neurotypical children. Children with autism displayed enhanced sensitivity to large, high-contrast low-spatial frequency stimuli as indexed by significantly shorter P1 response latencies to large vs. small gratings. The current study also found that children with autism had larger amplitude responses to large gratings irrespective of contrast. A linear regression established that P1 adaptive mean amplitude for large, high-contrast sinusoidal gratings significantly predicted hyperresponsiveness item mean scores on the Sensory Experiences Questionnaire for children with autism, but not for neurotypical children. We conclude that children with autism have differences in the mechanisms that underlie low-level visual processing potentially related to altered visual spatial suppression or contrast gain control.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Levels of peripheral Neuregulin 1 are increased in non-medicated autism spectrum disorder patients.Though schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are separate diseases, they have some common clinical manifestations and common pathogenic mechanisms. Numerous genes are associated with these conditions. Among these genes, Neuregulin-1 forms a risk for schizophrenia and some studies have shown polymorphism of this gene accompanies schizophrenia. NRG1 has a wide variety of functions, including neuronal migration, axon guidance, synaptic transmission, oligodendroglial maturation, and neurite outgrowth. To date, NRG1 levels have not been researched in ASD patients and considering the neurodevelopmental effects of NRG1, this study aimed to research the peripheral NRG1 levels in ASD patients. The study compared 32 ASD patients and 32 healthy controls. Serum NRG-1 levels were measured with ELISA. In ASD patients (mean ± SD, 10.80 ± 4.78 ng/ml), the NRG1 levels were found to be statistically significantly high compared to the health control group (mean ± SD, 6.92 ± 4.91 ng/ml) (p = 0.004). According to the results we obtained, NRG1 was shown to play a possible role in ASD pathogenesis. There is a need for advanced studies on the possible role of NRG1 in ASD patients. This study is significant as it is the first study to measure peripheral NRG1 in ASD patients.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Is there an \"antisocial\" cerebellum? Evidence from disorders other than autism characterized by abnormal social behaviours.The cerebellum is a hindbrain structure which involvement in functions not related to motor control and planning is being increasingly recognized in the last decades. Studies on Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) have reported cerebellar involvement on these conditions characterized by social deficits and repetitive motor behavior patterns. Although such an involvement hints at a possible cerebellar participation in the social domain, the fact that ASD patients present both social and motor deficits impedes drawing any firm conclusion regarding cerebellar involvement in pathological social behaviours, probably influenced by the classical view of the cerebellum as a purely \"motor\" brain structure. Here, we suggest the cerebellum can be a key node for the production and control of normal and particularly aberrant social behaviours, as indicated by its involvement in other neuropsychiatric disorders which main symptom is deregulated social behaviour. Therefore, in this work, we briefly review cerebellar involvement in social behavior in rodent models, followed by discussing the findings linking the cerebellum to those other psychiatric conditions characterized by defective social behaviours. Finally, possible commonalities between the studies and putative underlying impaired functions will be discussed and experimental approaches both in patients and experimental animals will also be proposed, aimed at stimulating research on the role of the cerebellum in social behaviours and disorders characterized by social impairments, which, if successful, will definitely help reinforcing the proposed cerebellar involvement in the social domain.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The impact of auditory rhythmic cueing on gross motor skills in children with autism.[Purpose] This study aimed to investigate the effect of auditory rhythmic cueing on gross motor skills in children with autism. [Participants and Methods] A total of 30 autistic children aged 8-10 years with mild to moderate autistic features participated in this study. They were randomly allocated to either the control group (n=15), which underwent a specially designed physical therapy program, or the study group (n=15), which underwent the same program in addition to gait training with rhythmic auditory stimulation. To provide rhythmic auditory stimulation, combination of a metronome beat set to the child's cadence and rhythmic cueing from the MIDI Cuebase musical program was used. Both groups received 3 sessions per week for 3 months. The Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency 2nd Edition was used to assess gross motor skills at baseline and after 3 months of intervention. [Results] The study found statistically significant improvements in bilateral coordination, balance, running speed and agility, and strength in both groups after treatment. Moreover, there were statistically significant differences between the 2 groups, with the study group showing better improvement in all outcome measures. [Conclusion] Gait training with auditory rhythmic cueing elicited a positive effect on the gross motor skills of children with autism.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Relations between Touch Target Size and Drag Distance in Mobile Applications for Users with Autism Spectrum Disorders.In recent years, the development of mobile applications for people within the autism spectrum has proliferated to help enhance skills that could be diminished in users with this condition. However, the usability of these applications does not appear to be the focus of development because users with autism can have difficulty with fine motor skills. This article focuses on evaluating the optimal drag distance and the sizes of the interaction elements for users with Autism Spectrum Disorder. To accomplish this goal, a case study was conducted that involved 20 users with Autism Spectrum Disorder and 30 users with typical development, using a prototype generated and two applications for commercial use on 7-in. tablets. For both developed applications, a slight variation can be observed between the different groups of participants. In the interaction with Proyect@ Habilidades, the application has pictograms of 65 pixels and it has a maximum trailing distance of 340 pixels. Moreover, in Proyect@ Retratos, where there is a minimum deviation between users with levels of autism 1 and 2, it also has pictograms of 65 pixels but with a drag distance of 110 pixels. For this reason, according to the results, we suggest that in order to obtain better results in the interaction with applications aimed at users diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders, the applications should have pictograms of a range of 65 pixels with a drag interaction between 110 and 340 pixels. Considering in context a 7-in. tablet with a resolution of 1280 × 800 pixels.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Early Disruption of the Microbiome Leading to Decreased Antioxidant Capacity and Epigenetic Changes: Implications for the Rise in Autism.Currently, 1 out of every 59 children in the United States is diagnosed with autism. While initial research to find the possible causes for autism were mostly focused on the genome, more recent studies indicate a significant role for epigenetic regulation of gene expression and the microbiome. In this review article, we examine the connections between early disruption of the developing microbiome and gastrointestinal tract function, with particular regard to susceptibility to autism. The biological mechanisms that accompany individuals with autism are reviewed in this manuscript including immune system dysregulation, inflammation, oxidative stress, metabolic and methylation abnormalities as well as gastrointestinal distress. We propose that these autism-associated biological mechanisms may be caused and/or sustained by dysbiosis, an alteration to the composition of resident commensal communities relative to the community found in healthy individuals and its redox and epigenetic consequences, changes that in part can be due to early use and over-use of antibiotics across generations. Further studies are warranted to clarify the contribution of oxidative stress and gut microbiome in the pathophysiology of autism. A better understanding of the microbiome and gastrointestinal tract in relation to autism will provide promising new opportunities to develop novel treatment modalities.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Molecular Dissection of Neurobeachin Function at Excitatory Synapses.Spines are small protrusions from dendrites where most excitatory synapses reside. Changes in number, shape, and size of dendritic spines often reflect changes of neural activity in entire circuits or at individual synapses, making spines key structures of synaptic plasticity. Neurobeachin is a multidomain protein with roles in spine formation, postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor targeting and actin distribution. However, the contributions of individual domains of Neurobeachin to these functions is poorly understood. Here, we used mostly live cell imaging and patch-clamp electrophysiology to monitor morphology and function of spinous synapses in primary hippocampal neurons. We demonstrate that a recombinant full-length Neurobeachin from humans can restore mushroom spine density and excitatory postsynaptic currents in neurons of Neurobeachin-deficient mice. We then probed the role of individual domains of Neurobeachin by comparing them to the full-length molecule in rescue experiments of knockout neurons. We show that the combined PH-BEACH domain complex is highly localized in spine heads, and that it is sufficient to restore normal spine density and surface targeting of postsynaptic AMPA receptors. In addition, we report that the Armadillo domain facilitates the formation of filopodia, long dendritic protrusions which often precede the development of mature spines, whereas the PKA-binding site appears as a negative regulator of filopodial extension. Thus, our results indicate that individual domains of Neurobeachin sustain important and specific roles in the regulation of spinous synapses. Since heterozygous mutations in Neurobeachin occur in autistic patients, the results will also improve our understanding of pathomechanism in neuropsychiatric disorders associated with impairments of spine function.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Effect of the autism-associated lncRNA Shank2-AS on architecture and growth of neurons.The pathogenic mechanism of autism is complex, and current research has shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) may play important roles in this process. The antisense lncRNA of SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 2 (Shank2-AS) is upregulated in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), whereas the expression of its sense strand gene Shank2 is downregulated. In neuronal cells, Shank2-AS and Shank2 can form a double-stranded RNA and inhibit Shank2 expression. Overexpression of Shank2-AS decreases neurite numbers and lengths, thereby inhibiting the proliferation of neuronal cells and promoting their apoptosis. Overexpression of Shank2 inhibits the abovementioned effects of Shank2-AS, and transfection of a vector containing the 10th intron of Shank2 (Shank2-AS is reverse-transcribed from this region) also blocks the function of Shank2-AS. Shank2 small interfering RNA plays a role similar to Shank2-AS. Therefore, Shank2-AS is abnormally expressed in patients with ASD and may affect the structure and growth of neurons by regulating Shank2 expression, thereby facilitating the development of ASD.\n",

In the adult brain, CDH13 expression is restricted e.g. to the presynaptic compartment of inhibitory GABAergic synapses in the hippocampus and Cdh13 knockout mice show an increased inhibitory drive onto hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, leading to a shift in excitatory/inhibitory balance. CDH13 is also moderating migration of serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus, establishing projections preferentially to the thalamus and cerebellum during brain development. Furthermore, CDH13 is upregulated by chronic stress as well as in depression, suggesting a role in early-life adaptation to stressful experience. Here, we therefore investigated the interaction between Cdh13 variation and neonatal maternal separation (MS) in mice.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Regulatory genes and pathways disrupted in autism spectrum disorders.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly prevalent and complex genetic disorder. The complex genetic make-up of ASD has been extensively studied and both common and rare genetic variants in up to 1000 genes have been linked to increased ASD risk. While these studies highlight the genetic complexity and begin to provide a window for delineating pathways at risk in ASD, the pathogenicity and specific contribution of many mutations to the disorder are poorly understood. Defining the convergent pathways disrupted by this large number of ASD-associated genetic variants will help to understand disease pathogenesis and direct future therapeutic efforts for the groups of patients with distinct etiologies. Here, we review some of the common regulatory pathways including chromatin remodeling, transcription, and alternative splicing that have emerged as common features from genetic and transcriptomic profiling of ASD. For each category, we focus on one gene (CHD8, FOXP1, and RBFOX1) that is significantly linked to ASD and functionally characterized in recent years. Finally, we discuss genetic and transcriptomic overlap between ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders.\n",

This response was investigated in a sample of 32 young males with ASD aged between 9 and 18 years (M = 14.3 yr, SD = 2.7 yr), using a standardised experimental protocol combined with individualised stressor and non-stressor tasks. Results indicated that about half of the sample demonstrated unexpected HPA axis response patterns, and that recovery from stress cortisol concentrations were significantly associated with a single symptom of Social Phobia and Morning cortisol. These findings suggest that one of the key diagnostic criteria for ASD may be strongly influential in the HPA axis responses of boys with ASD and that training regimesto assist them to form less fearful associations with their non-ASD peers may be central to the academic and social progress of these boys.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Failing, hacking, passing: Autism, entanglement, and the ethics of transformation.One of the most notable recent changes in autism science is the belief that autism is a heterogeneous condition with no singular essence. I argue that this notion of 'autistic heterogeneity' can be conceived as an 'agential cut' and traced to uncertainty work conducted by cognitive psychologists during the early 1990s. Researchers at this time overcame uncertainty in scientific theory by locating it within autism itself: epistemological uncertainty was interwoven with ontological indeterminacy and autism became heterogeneous and chance like, a condition determined by indeterminacy. This paper considers not only the conceptual significance of this move but also the impact upon forms of subjectivity. This analysis is undertaken by integrating the agential realism of Karen Barad with the historical ontology of Michel Foucault. I argue that these two approaches are, firstly, concerned with ontologies of emergence and, secondly, foreground the inherently ethical nature of change. As such these theories can be used to articulate an 'ethics of transformation'. I argue that the agential cut which brought about autistic heterogeneity is potentially problematic within an ethics of transformation, limiting the possibility of future change in subjectivity by imagining difference and resistance as properties of autism rather than the individual.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Compliance in autism: Self-report in action.Previous research indicates that autistic individuals are more likely to be bullied, and that they experience heightened anxiety and diminished self-esteem. These factors are known to predict heightened compliance, which is the tendency to agree with or carry out the requests and demands of others. This has a range of potentially serious consequences, particularly for an autistic person. This study utilised self-report (the Gudjonsson Compliance Scale) and behavioural measures of compliance (the door-in-the-face task) with 26 autistic and 26 typically developing adults. Participants also completed measures of early life bullying experiences, anxiety and self-esteem. Autistic participants were more compliant on both self-report and experimental tasks, and they reported more bullying experiences, higher anxiety and reduced self-esteem. Looking at both groups, bullying, anxiety and self-esteem were all correlated with self-reported compliance on the Gudjonsson Compliance Scale, yet only self-esteem was a unique predictor. None of these predictor variables related to behavioural compliance on the door in the face; nor did Gudjonsson Compliance Scale scores predict door-in-the-face performance, which may be better explained by situational and motivational factors. Findings have important implications for a range of real-life settings including requests made in the context of research, schools, the criminal justice system and the workplace.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Effect of visual stimuli of pain on empathy brain network in people with and without Autism Spectrum Disorder.The extent to which affective empathy is impaired in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) remains unclear, as some-but not all-previous neuroimaging studies investigating empathy for pain in ASD have shown similar activation levels to those of neurotypicals individuals. These inconsistent results could be due to the use of different empathy-eliciting stimuli. While some studies used pictures of faces exhibiting a painful expression, others used pictures of limbs in painful situations. In this study, we used fMRI to compare activation in areas associated with empathy processing (empathy network) for these two types of stimuli in 31 participants (16 with ASD, 15 controls). We found a group difference in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the thalamus when participants viewed stimuli of limbs in painful situations, but not when they viewed face stimuli with a painful expression. Both groups of participants activated their empathy network more when viewing pictures of limbs in painful situations than when viewing pictures of faces with a painful expression; this increased activation for limbs versus faces was significantly enhanced in controls relative to ASD participants, especially in the secondary somatosensory cortex (SII). Our findings suggest that empathy defect of people with ASD is contingent upon the type of stimuli used, and may be related to the level of Mirror Neuron System involvement, as brain regions showing group differences (IFG, SII) underlie embodiment. We discuss the potential clinical implications of our findings in terms of developing interventions boosting the empathetic abilities of people with ASD.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Parallel Development of Chromatin Patterns, Neuron Morphology, and Connections: Potential for Disruption in Autism.The phenotype of neurons and their connections depend on complex genetic and epigenetic processes that regulate the expression of genes in the nucleus during development and throughout life. Here we examined the distribution of nuclear chromatin patters in relation to the epigenetic landscape, phenotype and connections of neurons with a focus on the primate cerebral cortex. We show that nuclear patterns of chromatin in cortical neurons are related to neuron size and cortical connections. Moreover, we point to evidence that reveals an orderly sequence of events during development, linking chromatin and gene expression patterns, neuron morphology, function, and connections across cortical areas and layers. Based on this synthesis, we posit that systematic studies of changes in chromatin patterns and epigenetic marks across cortical areas will provide novel insights on the development and evolution of cortical networks, and their disruption in connectivity disorders of developmental origin, like autism. Achieving this requires embedding and interpreting genetic, transcriptional, and epigenetic studies within a framework that takes into consideration distinct types of neurons, local circuit interactions, and interareal pathways. These features vary systematically across cortical areas in parallel with laminar structure and are differentially affected in disorders. Finally, based on evidence that autism-associated genetic polymorphisms are especially prominent in excitatory neurons and connectivity disruption affects mostly limbic cortices, we employ this systematic approach to propose novel, targeted studies of projection neurons in limbic areas to elucidate the emergence and time-course of developmental disruptions in autism.\n",

Less is known whether protein expression changes are consistent with findings in subjects with schizophrenia. In the current study, we used liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) proteomics to determine the protein expression of four subcellular fractions in the forebrains of Fmr1 KO mice vs. C57BL/6 J mice and the effect of a negative allosteric modulator of mGluR5-2-Methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP)-on protein expression. Strain- and treatment-specific differential expression of proteins was observed, many of which have previously been observed in the brains of subjects with schizophrenia. Western blotting verified the direction and magnitude of change for several proteins in different subcellular fractions as follows: neurofilament light protein (NEFL) and 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNP) in the total homogenate; heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins C1/C2 (HNRNPC) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D0 (HNRNPD) in the nuclear fraction; excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) and ras-related protein rab 3a (RAB3A) in the synaptic fraction; and ras-related protein rab 35 (RAB35) and neuromodulin (GAP43) in the rough endoplasmic reticulum fraction.

      "ABSTRACT Anxiety and depression in adults with autism spectrum disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis.Adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are thought to be at disproportionate risk of developing mental health comorbidities, with anxiety and depression being considered most prominent amongst these. Yet, no systematic review has been carried out to date to examine rates of both anxiety and depression focusing specifically on adults with ASD. This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the rates of anxiety and depression in adults with ASD and the impact of factors such as assessment methods and presence of comorbid intellectual disability (ID) diagnosis on estimated prevalence rates. Electronic database searches for studies published between January 2000 and September 2017 identified a total of 35 studies, including 30 studies measuring anxiety (n = 26 070; mean age = 30.9, s.d. = 6.2 years) and 29 studies measuring depression (n = 26 117; mean age = 31.1, s.d. = 6.8 years). The pooled estimation of current and lifetime prevalence for adults with ASD were 27% and 42% for any anxiety disorder, and 23% and 37% for depressive disorder. Further analyses revealed that the use of questionnaire measures and the presence of ID may significantly influence estimates of prevalence. The current literature suffers from a high degree of heterogeneity in study method and an overreliance on clinical samples. These results highlight the importance of community-based studies and the identification and inclusion of well-characterized samples to reduce heterogeneity and bias in estimates of prevalence for comorbidity in adults with ASD and other populations with complex psychiatric presentations.\n",

There were no similar cases in the family and among close relatives. MRI study confirmed rhombencephalosynapsis (fusion of cerebellar hemispheres in combination with the agenesis of cerebellar vermis) and mild dilation of the lateral ventricles. Other main findings are bilateral parieto-temporal alopecia and brachiturricephaly (broad skull shape and tower-like elongation of the cranium in the vertical axis), low-set posteriorly retracted ears, strabismus (in the right eye), hypotonia (Beighton scale score - 6) and ataxia (trouble maintaining balance). Patient has no signs of trigeminal anesthesia, no recurrent, painless eye infections, corneal opacities and ulcerated wounds on the facial skin and buccal mucosa were observed. Based on the scientific literature we suggest a finding of brachiturricephaly in addition to rhombencephalosynapsis and bilateral alopecia sufficient to put a diagnosis of GLHS. Patient did not speak, disregarded guardians and clinician addressing him, did not make eye contact, was restless and occasionally displayed aggression and self-injurious behavior. These symptoms confirm the earlier diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Therefore, the current study describes a case of co-occurrence of GLHS and ASD.\n",

Immune system alterations have being demonstrated in ASD, both in humans and via animal models; immune imbalance thus arises as a possible pathway for drug intervention. In this review, the studies were classified into 2 major groups: (1) clinical research whose authors classify therapies with primary anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory actions, making use of: sulforaphane, celecoxib, lenalidomide, pentoxifylline, spironolactone, flavonoid luteolin, corticosteroids, oral immunoglobulin, intravenous immunoglobulin, cell therapy, dialyzable lymphocyte extracts, minocycline, and pioglitazone; and (2) other ASD therapies already used or currently under study whose initial characteristics were neither anti-inflammatory nor immunomodulatory initially, but displayed a capacity for immunomodulation throughout the treatment: risperidone, vitamin D, omega-3, Ginkgo biloba, L-carnosine, N-acetylcysteine, and microbiome restoration.

      "ABSTRACT Charisma and the clinic.Here we argue that 'charisma', a concept widely taken up within geography and the environmental humanities, is of utility to the social studies of medicine. Charisma, we suggest, draws attention to the affective dimensions of medical work, the ways in which these affective relations are structured, and the manner in which they are intimately tied to particular material-discursive contexts. The paper differentiates this notion of charisma from Weber's analyses of the 'charismatic leader' before detailing three forms of charisma - ecological (which relates to the affordances an entity has), corporeal (related to bodily interaction) and aesthetic (pertaining to an entity's initial visual and emotional impact). Drawing on interview data, we then show how this framework can be used to understand the manner in which psychologists and neuroscientists have come to see and act on autism. We conclude the article by suggesting that examining charisma within healthcare settings furthers the concept, in particular by drawing attention to the discursive features of ecologies and the 'non-innocence' of charisma.\n",

      "ABSTRACT A Developmental Study of Abnormal Behaviors and Altered GABAergic Signaling in the VPA-Treated Rat Model of Autism.Although studies have investigated the role of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic signaling in rodent neural development and behaviors relevant to autism, behavioral ontogeny, as underlain by the changes in GABAergic system, is poorly characterized in different brain regions. Here, we employed a valproic acid (VPA) rat model of autism to investigate the autism-like behaviors and GABAergic glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) expression underlying these altered behaviors in multiple brain areas at different developmental stages from birth to adulthood. We found that VPA-treated rats exhibited behavioral abnormalities relevant to autism, including delayed nervous reflex development, altered motor coordination, delayed sensory development, autistic-like and anxiety behaviors and impaired spatial learning and memory. We also found that VPA rats had the decreased expression of GAD67 in the hippocampus (HC) and cerebellum from childhood to adulthood, while decreased GAD67 expression of the temporal cortex (TC) was only observed in adulthood. Conversely, GAD67 expression was increased in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) from adolescence to adulthood. The dysregulated GAD67 expression could alter the excitatory-inhibitory balance in the cerebral cortex, HC and cerebellum. Our findings indicate an impaired GABAergic system could be a major etiological factor occurring in the cerebral cortex, HC and cerebellum of human cases of autism, which suggests enhancement of GABA signaling would be a promising therapeutic target for its treatment.\n",

Despite this re-conceptualization, research initiatives, including the NIMH's Research Domain Criteria and Precision Medicine, highlight the need to bridge psychiatric and psychological classification methodologies with biomedical techniques. Combining traditional bibliometric co-word techniques, with tenets of graph theory and network analysis, this article provides an objective thematic review of research between 1994 and 2015 to consider evolution and focus. Results illustrate growth in Autism research since 2006, with nascent focus on physiology.

      "ABSTRACT Small cells with big implications: Microglia and sex differences in brain development, plasticity and behavioral health.Brain sex differences are programmed largely by sex hormone secretions and direct sex chromosome effects in early life, and are subsequently modulated by early life experiences. The brain's resident immune cells, called microglia, actively contribute to brain development. Recent research has shown that microglia are sexually dimorphic, especially during early life, and may participate in sex-specific organization of the brain and behavior. Likewise, sex differences in immune cells and their signaling in the adult brain have been found, although in most cases their function remains unclear. Additionally, immune cells and their signaling have been implicated in many disorders in which brain development or plasticity is altered, including autism, schizophrenia, pain disorders, major depression, and postpartum depression. This review summarizes what is currently known about sex differences in neuroimmune function in development and during other major phases of brain plasticity, as well as the current state of knowledge regarding sex-specific neuroimmune function in psychiatric disorders.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Mind the gut: probiotics in paediatric neurogastroenterology.The gut-brain axis has recently emerged as a key modulator of human health and the intestinal microbiome has a well-recognised pivotal role in this strong connection. The aim of this narrative review is to update and summarise the effect and clinical applicability of probiotics in paediatric neurogastroenterology. The Cochrane Database and PubMed were searched using keywords relating to different subtypes of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) and their symptoms, those relating to the CNS and related neurological or behavioural dysfunction as well as 'probiotic' OR 'probiotics'. Included papers were limited to those including children (aged 0-18 years) and using English language. Although significant effects of specific strains have been reported in infants with FGIDs, heterogeneity amongst the studies (different products and concentrations used and FGID subtypes), has limited the ability to draw an overall conclusion on the clinical value of probiotics. According to different meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials, the use of Lactobacillus reuteri (DSM 17938) was associated with a significant decrease in average crying time in infantile colic. There is moderate evidence for this strain and LGG and limited evidence (based on one study each) for the beneficial effect of VSL#3 and a three-strain bifidobacteria mix in abdominal pain FGIDs, particularly in the irritable bowel disease subgroup of children, but not in functional dyspepsia. There is currently no clear evidence of positive effects of oral probiotics in autistic spectrum disorder. Efficacy and safety of other strains or beneficial effects in other conditions still need to be proven, as probiotic properties are strain-specific, and data cannot be extrapolated to other brain-gut or mood diseases or to other probiotics of the same or different species. To transform the use of probiotics from a tempting suggestion to a promising treatment modality in neurogastroenterological disorders more accurate differentiation of the efficacy-proven strains, clarification of dose, duration, and outcome and a careful selection of the target patients are still necessary.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Aging in people with autism spectrum disorder].Autism spectrum disorder is characterized by a qualitative alteration in social interaction and communication associated with restricted interests and stereotyped behaviors. This condition will accompany people throughout their lives, with variations in their evolution. Our objectives were to know the evolutionary characteristics of people with autistic spectrum disorder, analyzing cognitive, behavioral, health, mortality and their needs in the aging stage, which will guide the planning of specific support resources. We analyze studies related to the evolution in adult life in people with this disorder, with or without identified entities, and socio-health conditions that should be considered in the aging process. The knowledge about aging in people with autism is still scarce and it is difficult to define a specific pattern because this will depend, among other factors, on the etiology, the degree, the presence of intellectual disability and/or epilepsy, and the scope in where live, which can even condition the life expectancy. Aging has been associated with mood disorders, depression, deterioration in executive functions and episodic memory, although it is difficult to differentiate it from natural aging in people with typical development. The identification of a specific entity will allow to know the possible evolution and prevent complications in syndromes that may be associated with autism: fragile X, Down, Angelman, Rett and Williams, for that reason we rank the genetic and neurological consultation.\n",

The aim of this study was to learn what caring for children with ASD means to caregivers who live in rural Thailand. A hermeneutic phenomenological approach was used to analyze narrative data from interviews of five caregivers. Three themes emerged: (a) being sensitive to the word autism, (b) being trapped in a tunnel of distress, and (c) being the universe for the child. Healthcare professionals need to be sensitive to the caregivers' cultural customs in order to meet their expectations in a respectful way.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The neuropathological investigation of the brain in a monkey model of autism spectrum disorder with ABCA13 deletion.The precise biological etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the neuropathology of a monkey model of autism Human ABCA13 is the largest ABC transporter protein, with a length of 5058 amino acids and a predicted molecular weight of >450 kDa. However, the function of this protein remains to be elucidated. This protein is thought to be associated with major psychiatric disease. Using this monkey model of autism with an ABCA13 deletion and a mutation of 5HT2c, we neuropathologically investigated the changes in the neuronal formation in the frontal cortex. As a result, the neuronal formation in the cortex was found to be disorganized with regard to the neuronal size and laminal distribution in the ABCA13 deletion monkey. The catecholaminergic and GABAergic neuronal systems, serotoninergic neuronal formation (5HT2c) were also found to be impaired by an immunohistochemical evaluation. This study suggested that ABCA13 deficit induces the impairment of neuronal maturation or migration, and the function of the neuronal network. This protein might thus play a role in the neurodevelopmental function of the central nervous system and the dysfunction of this protein may be a pathophysiological cause of mental disorders including autism.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Enhancing Low-Intensity Coaching in Parent Implemented Early Start Denver Model Intervention for Early Autism: A Randomized Comparison Treatment Trial.Short-term low intensity parent implemented intervention studies for toddlers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have found it difficult to demonstrate significantly improved developmental scores or autism severity compared to community treatment. We conducted a randomized comparative intent-to-treat study of a parent implemented intervention to (1) test the effects of an enhanced version on parent and child learning, and (2) evaluate the sensitivity to change of proximal versus distal measures of child behavior. We randomized 45 children with ASD, 12-30 months of age, into one of two versions of parent-implemented Early Start Denver Model (P-ESDM), the basic model, in which we delivered 1.5 h of clinic-based parent coaching weekly, and an enhanced version that contained three additions: motivational interviewing, multimodal learning tools, and a weekly 1.5-h home visit. We delivered the intervention for 12 weeks and measured child and parent change frequently in multiple settings. We found a time-by-group interaction: parents in the enhanced group demonstrated significantly greater gains in interaction skills than did parents in the non-enhanced group. Both interventions were associated with significant developmental acceleration; however, child outcomes did not differ by group. We found a significant relationship between degree of change in parental interaction skill and rate of children's improvement on our proximal measure. Parents in both groups reported satisfaction with the intervention. These findings suggest that parent skills improved more in the enhanced group than the comparison group. Children in the two groups showed similar improvements. Rate of individual parent learning was associated with greater individual child progress on a measure quite proximal to the treatment, though not on standardized assessments.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Distractor Inhibition in Autism Spectrum Disorder: Evidence of a Selective Impairment for Individuals with Co-occurring Motor Difficulties.Although most researchers agree that individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) exhibit atypical attention, there is little consensus on the exact nature of their deficits. We explored whether attentional control in ASD varies as a function of motor proficiency. Nineteen children with ASD and 26 typically-developing controls completed the Movement Assessment Battery for Children and two ocular motor tasks requiring them to generate a saccade toward, and fixate, a visual target in the presence or absence of a distractor. The ASD group demonstrated poorer accuracy than typically-developing controls when distractors were present. Importantly, however, ASD symptomology was only related to poorer accuracy in individuals with motor difficulties. These findings suggest that distractor inhibition may be selectively impaired in this subgroup.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN) as a genetically simple model of multifaceted neuropathology resulting from defects in autophagy.Autophagy is an essential and conserved cellular homeostatic process. Defects in the core and accessory components of the autophagic machinery would most severely impact terminally differentiated cells, such as neurons. The neurodevelopmental/neurodegenerative disorder β-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN) resulted from heterozygous or hemizygous germline mutations/pathogenic variant of the X chromosome gene WDR45, encoding WD40 repeat protein interacting with phosphoinositides 4 (WIPI4). This most recently identified subtype of the spectrum of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation diseases is characterized by a biphasic mode of disease manifestation and progression. The first phase involves early-onset of epileptic seizures, global developmental delay, intellectual disability and autistic syndrome. Subsequently, Parkinsonism and dystonia, as well as dementia, emerge in a subacute manner in adolescence or early adulthood. BPAN disease phenotypes are thus complex and linked to a wide range of other neuropathological disorders. WIPI4/WDR45 has an essential role in autophagy, acting as a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate binding effector that participates in autophagosome biogenesis and size control. Here, we discuss recent updates on WIPI4's mechanistic role in autophagy and link the neuropathological manifestations of BPAN's biphasic infantile onset (epilepsy, autism) and adolescent onset (dystonic, Parkinsonism, dementia) phenotypes to neurological consequences of autophagy impairment that are now known or emerging in many other neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. As monogenic WDR45 mutations in BPAN result in a large spectrum of disease phenotypes that stem from autophagic dysfunctions, it could potentially serve as a simple and unique genetic model to investigate disease pathology and therapeutics for a wider range of neuropathological conditions with autophagy defects.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Microbiota-gut-brain research: a critical analysis.Microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) research is a fast-growing field of inquiry with important implications for how human brain function and behaviour are understood. Researchers manipulate gut microbes ('microbiota') to reveal connections between intestinal microbiota and normal brain functions (e.g., cognition, emotion, memory) or pathological states (e.g., anxiety and mood disorders, neural developmental disorders such as autism). Many claims are made about causal relationships between gut microbiota and human behaviour. By uncovering these relationships, MGB research aims to offer new explanations of mental health and potential avenues of treatment.So far, limited evaluation has been made of MGB's methods and its core experimental findings, many of which are extensively reiterated in copious reviews of the field. These factors, plus the self-help potential of MGB, have combined to encourage uncritical public uptake of MGB discoveries. Both social and professional media focus on the potential for dietary intervention in mental health, and causal relationships are assumed to be established.Our target article has two main aims. One is to examine critically the core practices and findings of experimental MGB research, and to raise questions about them for brain and behavioural scientists who may not be familiar with the field. The other is to challenge the way in which MGB findings are presented. Our positive goal is to suggest how current problems and weaknesses may be addressed, in order for both scientific and public audiences to gain a clearer picture of MGB research and its strengths and limitations.\n",

      "ABSTRACT An acoustic study of lexical stress contrastivity in children with and without autism spectrum disorders.In this exploratory study, we examined stress contrastivity within real word productions elicited via picture naming in 20 children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and 20 typical peers group-wise matched on age and vocabulary. Targets had a dominant pattern of lexical stress beginning with a strong-weak pattern (SW: 'caterpillar', 'butterfly') or a non-dominant pattern of lexical stress beginning with a weak-strong pattern (WS: 'tomato', 'potato'). Children produced each target twice (n = 320 productions). Acoustic measures were made for the duration, fundamental frequency, and intensity of the first two vowels for each word production. For vowel duration and fundamental frequency, children with ASD and typical peers produced a similar magnitude of stress contrastivity for SW and WS words. However, there was a significant group difference in the way contrastivity in intensity was realised for WS words whereby children with ASD produced less stress contrastivity than typical peers. Bayesian analyses were in line with our interpretation of our frequentist analyses.\n",

      "ABSTRACT When do Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder Take Common Ground into Account During Communication?One feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a deficit in verbal reference production, that is, providing an appropriate amount of verbal information for the listener to refer to things, people, and events. However, very few studies have manipulated whether individuals with ASD can take a speaker's perspective to interpret verbal reference. A critical limitation of all interpretation studies is that comprehension of another's verbal reference required the participant to represent only the other's visual perspective. Yet, many everyday interpretations of verbal reference require knowledge of social perspective (i.e., a consideration of which experiences one has shared with which interlocutor). We investigated whether 22 5;0-7;11-year-old children with ASD and 22 well-matched typically developing (TD) children used social perspective to comprehend (Study 1) and produce (Study 2) verbal reference. Social perspective-taking was manipulated by having children collaboratively complete activities with one of two interlocutors such that for a given activity, one interlocutor was Knowledgeable and one was Naïve. Study 1 found no between-group differences for the interpretation of ambiguous references based on social perspective. In Study 2, when producing referring terms, the ASD group made modifications based on listener needs, but this effect was significantly stronger in the TD group. Overall, the findings suggest that high-functioning children with ASD know with which interlocutor they have previously shared a given experience and can take this information into account to steer verbal reference. Nonetheless, they show clear performance limitations in this regard relative to well-matched controls. Autism Res 2018, 11: 1366-1375. © 2018 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: No one had studied if young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) could take into account previous collaboration with particular conversation partners to drive how well they communicate with others. In both their language understanding and spoken language, we found that five to 7-year-olds with ASD were able to consider what they had previously shared with the conversation partner. However, they were impaired when compared to typically developing children in the degree to which they tailored their spoken language for a specific listener.\n",

      "ABSTRACT \"We were on our own\": Mothers' experiences navigating the fragmented system of professional care for autism.Autism is a developmental disorder that emerges in early childhood. Treatments for autism span a wide variety of professionals and paraprofessionals in the medical and educational realms. This article draws on data from a survey of 620 parents of autistic children, including 385 written narratives, to examine the experiences of mothers as they engage with this fragmented system of professional care for children with autism. Findings suggest that engagement with treatments sent families into a complex and confusing universe of diagnosis and treatment. The fragmentation of autism's professional jurisdiction between the medical and educational systems meant that mothers struggled to find comprehensive professional care that met the standards recommended by leading medical research organizations. Many mothers found it necessary to reduce their workforce participation in order to obtain and maintain their children's treatment regimes, a phenomenon that transcended social class. However, the consequences of reducing work had differential impacts on families. While married and high socioeconomic status mothers were more insulated from the potential negative effects of losing one partner's income, single and low SES mothers experienced greater precarity. These findings connect the structure and arrangement of professional jurisdictions to the experiences of parents, suggesting ways that the fragmentation of professional care for autism can have negative impacts for women, single mothers, and low SES families.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Further evidence of a causal association between AGO1, a critical regulator of microRNA formation, and intellectual disability/autism spectrum disorder.Among the many regulators of microRNA formation, Argonaute 1 (AGO1) plays critical roles in RNA interference, which controls a wide range of biological activities. Recent large-scale genomic studies have identified at least five patients with intellectual disability/autism spectrum disorder who had de novo mutations in AGO1, but detailed clinical information was not available. The recognizable clinical features that are associated with AGO1 mutations remain to be determined. The proposita was a 15-year-old girl with diffuse hypotonia, infrequent seizures, and intellectual disability with an intelligence quotient of 41. She had characteristic facial features consisting of telecanthus, wide nasal bridge with bulbous nasal tip, and a round face with downslanted palpebral fissures. Serial computed tomography scans showed progressive calcification in the globus pallidus that became evident during childhood. A whole exome analysis in trio revealed a de novo heterozygous mutation in AGO1, i.e., c.595G > A p.(Gly199Ser). The distinctive facial features, i.e., telecanthus, wide nasal bridge with bulbous nasal tip, and a round face with downslanted palpebral fissures, closely resembled previously reported patients who had a chromosomal microdeletion encompassing AGO1 locus. The combinatory phenotype of such characteristic facial features and radiographic features, i.e. progressive calcification in the globus pallidus, in the presently reported patient suggest that AGO1 mutations lead to a syndromic form of intellectual disability/autism spectrum disorder. Distinctive facial features with early and progressive calcification in the globus pallidus may be suggestive of the presence of AGO1 mutations.\n",

In this article, we will discuss how vitamin D aids in the function of neuronal and glial tissue and the many health consequences in a person with vitamin D deficiency. Some of the effects of vitamin D deficiency that will be discussed include the development of dementia caused by the increase of cerebral soluble and insoluble amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides and a decrease of its anti-inflammatory/antioxidant properties, the link to depression by a reduction of the buffering of increased calcium in the brain, and vitamin D deficiency in expecting mothers linking to the development of autism and schizophrenic-like disorders, hypoxic brain injury, and other mental illnesses. Lastly, we will discuss how vitamin D deficiency is linked to the development of diabetes mellitus, its role in neuronal development and a decrease of microglial inflammatory function leading to increased brain infections.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Selected Psychological Aspects of Meat Consumption-A Short Review.Eating meat is deeply entrenched in Western culture. It is often associated with wealth and a highly nutritional diet; and for many people it is also an established habit that is difficult to change. The second half of the 20th century was a period of rapid growth in meat consumption, which resulted in intensified meat production. At the same time, eating meat has recently become subject to criticism for health-related, environmental or humanitarian reasons. This review aims to signal the potential consequences of a change of diet or switching to diets that are rich/poor in certain ingredients on the functioning of the hormonal and nervous system, which translates into changes in mood and behavior. This paper discusses the psychological phenomena which underlie the difficulty of changing one's food preferences and problems encountered while adding new products to the daily diet. Finally, this study summarizes the limitations of modifying eating habits that have resulted from established attitudes and habits.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Biochemical and Morphological Characterization of a Neurodevelopmental Disorder-Related Mono-ADP-Ribosylhydrolase, MACRO Domain Containing 2.MACRO Domain Containing 2 (MacroD2) is a neurodevelopmental disorder-related mono-ADP-ribosylhydrolase. Molecular features of this protein in neural tissues are largely unknown. In this study, we generated a specific antibody against MacroD2, and carried out expression and morphological analyses of the molecule during mouse brain development. In Western blotting, 2 MacroD2 isoforms with molecular masses of ∼70 and ∼75 kDa started to be expressed at embryonic day 16.5, reached the maximal level at postnatal day 8, and then gradually decreased through P30. In contrast, other isoforms with molecular masses of ∼110 and ∼140 kDa gradually increased during embryonic to postnatal development. In immunohistochemical analyses, MacroD2 was strongly detected in cortical neurons in layer II-V at P0 and P7, while the protein expression decreased significantly in the neurons at P30. Immunofluorescence analyses revealed that MacroD2 was mainly distributed in the soma and to a lesser extent in the axon and dendrite of immature primary cultured mouse hippocampal neurons. On the other hand, in the matured hippocampal neurons, while MacroD2 was detected in the soma, it displayed in dendrites a punctate distribution pattern with a partial colocalization with synaptic markers, synaptophysin, and PSD95. The obtained results indicate that MacroD2 is expressed and may have a physiological role in the central nervous system during brain development.\n",

This paper explores how grandparents support children with autism and their parents using a family systems perspective. A thematic analysis of eighteen semi-structured interviews was conducted with participants from nine families, capturing experiences of both parents' and grandparents'. Themes identified were family recalibrating; strengthening the family system; and current needs and future concerns of grandparents. The views of families indicated the overwhelming need to acknowledge the grandparental role in supporting families that strengthen the family system by supporting the needs of a child with autism. Findings revealed that grandfathers have a calming role in these families where children have significant behavioural difficulties.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Motor dysfunction as research domain across bipolar, obsessive-compulsive and neurodevelopmental disorders.Although genuine motor abnormalities (GMA) are frequently found in schizophrenia, they are also considered as an intrinsic feature of bipolar, obsessive-compulsive, and neurodevelopmental disorders with early onset such as autism, ADHD, and Tourette syndrome. Such transnosological observations strongly suggest a common neural pathophysiology. This systematic review highlights the evidence on GMA and their neuroanatomical substrates in bipolar, obsessive-compulsive, and neurodevelopmental disorders. The data lends support for a common pattern contributing to GMA expression in these diseases that seems to be related to cerebello-thalamo-cortical, fronto-parietal, and cortico-subcortical motor circuit dysfunction. The identified studies provide first evidence for a motor network dysfunction as a correlate of early neurodevelopmental deviance prior to clinical symptom expression. There are also first hints for a developmental risk factor model of these mental disorders. An in-depth analysis of motor networks and related patho-(physiological) mechanisms will not only help promoting Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) Motor System construct, but also facilitate the development of novel psychopharmacological models, as well as the identification of neurobiologically plausible target sites for non-invasive brain stimulation.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Inactivation of Magel2 suppresses oxytocin neurons through synaptic excitation-inhibition imbalance.Prader-Willi and the related Schaaf-Yang Syndromes (PWS/SYS) are rare neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by overlapping phenotypes of high incidence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and neonatal feeding difficulties. Based on clinical and basic studies, oxytocin pathway defects are suggested to contribute disease pathogenesis but the mechanism has been poorly understood. Specifically, whether the impairment in oxytocin system is limited to neuropeptide levels and how the functional properties of broader oxytocin neuron circuits affected in PWS/SYS have not been addressed. Using cell type specific electrophysiology, we investigated basic synaptic and cell autonomous properties of oxytocin neurons in the absence of MAGEL2; a hypothalamus enriched ubiquitin ligase regulator that is inactivated in both syndromes. We observed significant suppression of overall ex vivo oxytocin neuron activity, which was largely contributed by altered synaptic input profile; with reduced excitatory and increased inhibitory currents. Our results suggest that dysregulation of oxytocin system goes beyond altered neuropeptide expression and synaptic excitation inhibition imbalance impairs overall oxytocin pathway function.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Delayed autism spectrum disorder recognition in children and adolescents previously diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.Phenotypic elements of autism spectrum disorder can be masked by attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms, potentially leading to a misdiagnosis or delaying an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis. This study explored differences in the age of autism spectrum disorder diagnosis between participants with previously diagnosed attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder versus autism spectrum disorder-only respondents. Children and adolescents, but not adults, initially diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder received an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis an average of 1.8 years later than autism spectrum disorder-only children, although the findings regarding the adult sample should be interpreted with caution. Gender differences were also explored, revealing that the delay in receiving an autism diagnosis was 1.5 years in boys and 2.6 years in girls with pre-existing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, compared with boys and girls without prior attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. No significant gender differences were observed in the adult sample. We argue that overlapping symptoms between autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder might delay a formal diagnosis of autism either by leading to a misdiagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or by making it difficult to identify the presence of co-occurring autism spectrum disorder conditions once an initial diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder has been obtained. Current findings highlight the need to recruit multidimensional and multidisciplinary screening procedures to assess for potential emerging autism spectrum disorder hallmarks in children and adolescents diagnosed or presenting with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms.\n",

Atypical sensory processing was reported in 82% to 97% of the participants with ASD, depending on the study. This review found a significant impact of sensory abnormalities on adaptive behaviour. In addition, we found interrelations between sensory processing and attention skills.

      "ABSTRACT Fetal and Infancy Growth Pattern, Cord and Early Childhood Plasma Leptin, and Development of Autism Spectrum Disorder in the Boston Birth Cohort.Leptin is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in energy homeostasis. Emerging evidence suggests that leptin levels are altered in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD); however, this has not been studied prospectively. Rapid growth during infancy and early childhood has been implicated in ASD, but the evidence is inconsistent. As leptin is involved in growth and is a potential risk factor for ASD, we explored the associations between (a) cord, early childhood leptin and ASD; and (b) birth weight for gestational age, early childhood weight gain, and ASD. We also assessed the mediating role of leptin in the relationship between weight gain during infancy and ASD. This study was conducted in a sample of 822 subjects from the Boston Birth Cohort. ASD was defined from diagnostic codes in electronic medical records. Extremely rapid weight gain during infancy was associated with a greater ASD risk and this persisted after adjusting for potential confounders (aOR: 3.11; 95% CI: 1.37, 7.07). Similarly, children that had higher plasma leptin levels, prior to ASD diagnosis, had an increased ASD risk in both unadjusted and adjusted models (aOR: 7.87; 95% CI: 2.06, 30.04). Further, early childhood leptin indirectly mediated the relationship between rapid weight gain and ASD. No associations were found between birth weight for gestational age, cord leptin and risk of ASD. Our findings provide a basis to further explore whether the combination of early life growth pattern and a biomarker such as leptin can predict ASD earlier. Autism Res 2018, 11: 1416-1431. © 2018 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: Is early life growth and a biomarker leptin related to ASD risk? To answer this question, we followed 822 children from birth and found that those who gained weight very quickly in infancy, had higher leptin levels in early childhood, had a greater chance of later ASD diagnosis. More research is needed to see if infant's weight gain pattern along with a biomarker (such as leptin) can be used to identify children with ASD sooner.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The contribution of [1H] magnetic resonance spectroscopy to the study of excitation-inhibition in autism.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects over 1:100 of the population and costs the UK more than £32bn and the USA more than $175bn (£104bn) annually. Its core symptoms are social and communication difficulties, repetitive behaviours and sensory hyper- or hypo-sensitivities. A highly diverse phenotypic presentation likely reflects its etiological heterogeneity and makes finding treatment targets for ASD challenging. In addition, there are no means to identify biologically responsive individuals who may benefit from specific interventions. There is hope however, and in this review we consolidate how findings from magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) add to the evidence that differences in the brain's excitatory glutamate and inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) balance may be both a key biomarker and a tractable treatment target in ASD.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Monoamine oxidase isoenzymes: genes, functions and targets for behavior and cancer therapy.Monoamine oxidase (MAO) catalyzes the oxidative deamination of monoamine neurotransmitters and dietary amines. Two pharmacological types with different substrate and inhibitor specificities were reported. Molecular cloning revealed that the two types of MAO were different genes expressed as different proteins with different functions. MAO A and B have identical intron-exon organization derived by duplication of a common ancestral gene thus they are termed isoenzymes. MAO A knockout mice exhibited aggression, the first clear evidence linking genes to behavior. MAO A KO mice exhibited autistic-like behaviors which could be prevented by reducing serotonin levels at an early developmental age (P1-P7) providing potential therapy. MAO B KO mice were non-aggressive and resistant to Parkinsongenic neurotoxin. More recently it was found that MAO A is overexpressed in prostate cancer and correlates with degree of malignancy. The oncogenic mechanism involves a ROS-activated AKT/FOXO1/TWIST1 signaling pathway. Deletion of MAO A reduced prostate cancer stem cells and suppressed invasive adenocarcinoma. MAO A was also overexpressed in classical Hodgkin lymphoma and glioma brain tumors. MAO B was overexpressed in glioma and non-small cell lung cancer. MAO A inhibitors reduce the growth of prostate cancer, drug sensitive and resistant gliomas and classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and enhance standard chemotherapy. Currently, we are developing NIR dye-conjugated clorgyline (MAO A inhibitor) as a novel dual therapeutic/diagnostic agent for cancer. A phase II clinical trial of MAO inhibitor for biochemical recurrent prostate cancer is ongoing. The role of MAO A and B in several cancer types opens new avenues for cancer therapies.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Brief Report: Flanker Visual Filtering Ability in Older Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder.Recent research has documented impaired ability to resist interference from visual distractors in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and suggests that this phenomenon may be more pronounced in young versus older children (Christ et al., Neuropsychology 25(6):690-701, 2011). The present study extends previous findings by examining visual filtering inhibitory ability within an older adolescent population. A flanker visual filtering task was administered to 36 adolescents with ASD and 44 adolescents without ASD (age: 11-20 years). Analysis revealed no evidence of group differences in visual filtering performance. Taken together with previous research, these results suggest that during early adolescence the previously observed impairment may resolve or compensatory strategies develop, allowing individuals with ASD to perform as well as their neurotypical peers.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Increasing paternal age alters anxiety-related behaviour in adult mice.Advanced paternal age (APA) is associated with an increased risk of adverse health outcomes in offspring, including autism and schizophrenia. In the present study, we investigated the behaviour of young (3-month-old; Control), middle aged (12 to 15-month-old; APA1) and old (24-month-old; APA2) C57BL/6J sires and their adult offspring. Male and female mice were tested at 10 weeks of age on a behavioural test battery including the elevated plus-maze, hole board, light/dark emergence, forced swim test, novelty-suppressed feeding and for prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response. Increasing the APA sire age to 24 months was shown to be associated with increased anxiety-related behaviour in the offspring, and indicated that increasing APA sire age produced a more robust hypoexplorative phenotype. Thus, increasing paternal age was associated with an increase in severity of an anxiogenic phenotype in their adult offspring. Ultimately, the results of these studies show that mouse models of APA are valuable for elucidating the mechanisms by which APA influences brain-related outcomes.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Weakness of visual working memory in autism.Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are often supported in daily life by visual presentations such as picture cards or illustrations. Therefore, they are considered to have visual strength. However, whether people with ASD are cognitively superior in visual processing and what causes the difference between visual and other sensory processing remain unknown. Thus, we compared visual and auditory processing from an aspect of memory in people with ASD and controls. We conducted the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) with 64 adults with ASD and 30 controls matched for gender, age, and Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FIQ). Our results showed that participants with ASD were inferior in visual working memory (P < .01), on a task in which a visual target was pointed every second. Another visual memory, namely, Visual Reproduction in which four geometric figures were presented each by 10 sec, and auditory memory, including working memory, revealed no significant differences between groups. Other visual memory, namely, Visual Paired Associates in which paired presentations were shown every 3 sec, had weak differences (P = .019). Thus, people with ASD might have difficulties processing rapid visual information. Autism Res 2018, 11: 1245-1252. © 2018 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: Autistic people are often supported by visual presentations. In this study, we inspected whether they have visual superiority. We showed that they were not visually superior in cognitive aspects, and were poor not at auditory but at visual working memory. Static visual memory in which memorization time is longer than that in working memory was intact in autism. Unusual rapid visual presentation may bother people with autism.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The oxytocin system of mice and men-Similarities and discrepancies of oxytocinergic modulation in rodents and primates.Nonapeptides and their respective receptors have been conserved throughout evolution and display astonishing similarities among the animal kingdom. They can be found in worms, birds, fish, amphibians, reptiles and mammals, including rodents, non-human primates and humans. In particular, the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) has attracted the attention of scientists due to its profound effects on social behavior. However, although both the neuropeptide and its receptor are identical in rodents and primates, the effects of OT vary greatly in the two species. Here, we provide a brief overview about OT's role in the evolution of mammals and provide reasons for the manifold effects of OT within the brain with a particular focus on the discrepancy of OT's effects in rodents and primates. In addition, we suggest new approaches towards improvement of translatability of scientific studies and highlight the most recent advances in animal models for autism spectrum disorder, a disease, in which the normal function of the OT system seems to be impaired.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Increased oxidative stress in the cerebellum and peripheral immune cells leads to exaggerated autism-like repetitive behavior due to deficiency of antioxidant response in BTBR T + tf/J mice.Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects social cognitive abilities resulting in communication or sensory deficits, and stereotyped behaviors in millions of people worldwide. Oxidant-antioxidant imbalance contributes significantly to the neurobehavioral dysregulations and severity of symptoms in patients with autism, however it has not been explored earlier whether it affects autism-like behavior directly. Therefore, we investigated oxidant-antioxidant balance in peripheral immune cells (neutrophils and CD3+ T cells) and cerebellum of BTBR T + tf/J (BTBR) mice which show autism-like behavior and the social C57BL/6 J (C57) mice. Further, we utilized buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a glutathione depleting agent to assess the impact of oxidant-antioxidant dysregulation on autism-like behavior. Our study shows that BTBR mice have increased lipid/protein oxidation products in cerebellum and neutrophils/CD3+ T cells along with increased NADPH oxidase (NOX2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression. This was concurrent with lower levels of glutathione and enzymatic antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in the cerebellum and peripheral immune cells. BSO administration led to further lowering of glutathione with a concurrent upregulation of iNOS, and NOX2 in cerebellum and peripheral immune cells. However, there was deficiency of an adaptive antioxidant response which was associated with exaggerated repetitive behaviors in BTBR mice. On the other hand, C57 mice also had increased oxidative stress after BSO treatment, however there was an enzymatic antioxidant response both in cerebellum and periphery. Overall, this study suggests that BTBR mice have increased oxidative stress with a deficient enzymatic antioxidant response that is associated with autism-like repetitive behaviors.\n",

In the present study, 45 adults (28 male, age 22-48 years) with diagnoses of autism and intellectual delay were observed during vaccination or dental cleaning and their pain behaviours coded and measures of autism symptom severity, anxiety, depression and obsessivity taken. Our findings showed that greater autism severity predicted greater pain response which was partially mediated by anxiety and depression.

      "ABSTRACT Parental Perception and Participation in Genetic Testing Among Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders.The purpose of this study was to determine the factors associated with genetic testing in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and understand parental involvement in the decision to test using survey data of parents of children with ASD. Evaluation by a geneticist was associated with genetic testing by more than 39 times compared to evaluation by a nongeneticist (95% CI = 9.15-168.81). Those offered testing by the physicians were more than 6 times more likely to be tested than those not offered testing (95% CI = 1.66-24.61). Financial concerns, not being offered testing, and lack of awareness were the most consistent reasons for not testing given by participants. A physician's recommendation for testing and an evaluation by a geneticist were the most important factors associated with genetic testing in children with ASD. Educating primary care physicians and nongenetic specialists can potentially improve genetic testing among children with ASD.\n",

The children produced BSL versions of a video story in which two children are seen to enact a language-free scenario where one tricks the other. This task encourages elicitation of facial acts signalling intention and emotion, since the protagonists showed a range of such expressions during the events portrayed.

      "ABSTRACT Dependency of prepulse inhibition deficits on baseline startle reactivity in a mouse model of the human 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome.Hemizygous microdeletion at the chromosomal locus 22q11.2 is a copy number variation with strong genetic linkage to schizophrenia and related disorders. This association, along with its phenotypic overlap with the 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome, has motivated the establishment of Df[h22q11]/+ mice, in which the human 22q11.2 orthologous region is deleted. Previous investigations using this model showed the presence of reduced prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle reflex, a form of sensorimotor gating known to be impaired in a number of psychiatric disorders. Concomitantly to reduced PPI, however, Df[h22q11]/+ mice are also characterized by a robust increase in baseline startle reactivity, which may complicate or confound the interpretation of PPI. Therefore, the present study re-examined the relationship between acoustic startle reactivity and PPI in this mouse model. We found that while PPI is reduced in Df[h22q11]/+ mice when using its relative indexation (ie, % PPI), this deficit is no longer apparent when using the absolute quantification, that is, the direct comparison between pulse-alone and prepulse-plus-pulse conditions with successively increasing prepulse intensities. We further identified marked negative correlations between % PPI and startle reactivity in Df[h22q11]/+ mice. Moreover, when stratifying Df[h22q11]/+ mice into subgroups displaying low- and high-startle reactivity, only the latter subgroup displayed a significant reduction in % PPI. Collectively, our data suggest that alterations in baseline startle reactivity can confound the outcomes and interpretation of PPI in this mouse model of the human 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome.\n",

      "ABSTRACT A review of the use of EEG connectivity to measure the neurological characteristics of the sensory features in young people with autism.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition affecting about 1 in 100 children and is currently incurable. ASD represents a challenge to traditional methods of assessment and diagnosis, and it has been suggested that direct measures of brain activity and connectivity between brain regions during demanding tasks represents a potential pathway to building more accurate models of underlying brain function and ASD. One of the key behavioural diagnostic indicators of ASD consists of sensory features (SF), often characterised by over- or under-reactivity to environmental stimuli. SF are associated with behavioural difficulties that impede social and education success in these children as well as anxiety and depression. This review examines the previous literature on the measurement of EEG connectivity and SF observed in individuals with ASD.\n",

Using a grounded theory approach, we solicited the perspectives of parents and other primary caregivers of Black children with ASD on barriers and facilitators to ASD screening and referrals in primary care. A socioeconomically diverse sample of 22 female caregivers participated. Four themes emerged. First, while some caregivers noted their child's primary healthcare providers facilitated a timely ASD diagnosis, other participants reported these providers ignored early concerns about child developmental delays. Second, many participants felt racial bias negatively impacted caregiver-primary healthcare provider interactions. Third, legal/custodial issues slowed caregivers' abilities to follow up on referrals from their primary healthcare providers. Finally, caregivers described denial, shame, and stigma relating to ASD in the Black community as possible factors for delayed follow up to referrals. Differences based on socioeconomic status are discussed. Efforts to improve family-centered, culturally relevant care for all Black caregivers raising children with or at-risk for ASD are needed, particularly for those families experiencing the multiple effects of poverty.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Autism-linked CHD gene expression patterns during development predict multi-organ disease phenotypes.Recent large-scale exome sequencing studies have identified mutations in several members of the CHD (Chromodomain Helicase DNA-binding protein) gene family in neurodevelopmental disorders. Mutations in the CHD2 gene have been linked to developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism and seizures, CHD8 mutations to autism and intellectual disability, whereas haploinsufficiency of CHD7 is associated with executive dysfunction and intellectual disability. In addition to these neurodevelopmental features, a wide range of other developmental defects are associated with mutants of these genes, especially with regards to CHD7 haploinsufficiency, which is the primary cause of CHARGE syndrome. Whilst the developmental expression of CHD7 has been reported previously, limited information on the expression of CHD2 and CHD8 during development is available. Here, we compare the expression patterns of all three genes during mouse development directly. We find high, widespread expression of these genes at early stages of development that gradually becomes restricted during later developmental stages. Chd2 and Chd8 are widely expressed in the developing central nervous system (CNS) at all stages of development, with moderate expression remaining in the neocortex, hippocampus, olfactory bulb and cerebellum of the postnatal brain. Similarly, Chd7 expression is seen throughout the CNS during late embryogenesis and early postnatal development, with strong enrichment in the cerebellum, but displays low expression in the cortex and neurogenic niches in early life. In addition to expression in the brain, novel sites of Chd2 and Chd8 expression are reported. These findings suggest additional roles for these genes in organogenesis and predict that mutation of these genes may predispose individuals to a range of other, non-neurological developmental defects.\n",

In total, 102 adolescents (27 autistic girls, 26 autistic boys, 26 neurotypical girls, and 23 neurotypical boys), aged between 11 and 18 years completed the Friendship Qualities Scale, the Revised Peer Experiences Questionnaire and were interviewed about their friendships. Results demonstrated that in many ways, the friendships and social experiences of autistic girls are similar to those of neurotypical girls. Autistic girls, however, have significantly more social challenges than their neurotypical peers, experiencing more conflict and finding that conflict harder to manage successfully. Autistic boys showed quantitatively different friendship patterns to all other groups. There were consistent gender differences in the type of conflict which boys and girls experienced, regardless of diagnostic status. These findings suggest that gender, rather than diagnosis per se, plays a critical role in the way that autistic adolescents perceive and experience their social relationships.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Homozygous 2p11.2 deletion supports the implication of ELMOD3 in hearing loss and reveals the potential association of CAPG with ASD/ID etiology.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a set of neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by early-onset difficulties in social communication and unusually restricted, repetitive behavior and interests. Parental consanguinity may lead to higher risk of ASD and to more severe clinical presentations in the offspring. Studies of ASD families with high inbreeding enable the identification of inherited variants of this disorder particularly those with an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. In our study, using copy number variants (CNV) analysis, we identified a rare homozygous deletion in 2p11.2 region that affects ELMOD3, CAPG, and SH2D6 genes in a boy with ASD, intellectual disability (ID), and hearing impairment (HI). This deletion may reveal a new contiguous deletion syndrome in which ELMOD3, known to be implicated in autosomal recessive deafness underlies the HI of the proband and CAPG, member of actin regulatory proteins involved in cytoskeletal dynamic, an important function for brain development and activity, underlies the ASD/ID phenotype. A possible contribution of SH2D6 gene, as a part of a chimeric gene, to the clinical presentation of the patient is discussed. Our result supports the implication of ELMOD3 in hearing loss and highlights the potential clinical relevance of 2p11.2 deletion in autism and/or intellectual disability.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Autistic Traits in the Neurotypical Population do not Predict Increased Response Conservativeness in Perceptual Decision Making.Recent research has shown that adults and children with autism spectrum disorders have a more conservative decision criterion in perceptual decision making compared to neurotypical individuals, meaning that autistic participants prioritise accuracy over speed of a decision. Here, we test whether autistic traits in the neurotypical population correlate with increased response conservativeness. We employed three different tasks; for two tasks we recruited participants from China ( N = 39) and for one task from the United Kingdom ( N = 37). Our results show that autistic traits in the neurotypical population do not predict variation in response criterion. We also failed to replicate previous work showing a relationship between autistic traits and sensitivity to coherent motion and static orientation. Following the argument proposed by Gregory and Plaisted-Grant, we discuss why perceptual differences between autistic and neurotypical participants do not necessarily predict perceptual differences between neurotypical participants with high and low autistic traits.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Oxytocin and excitation/inhibition balance in social recognition.Social recognition is the sensitive domains of complex behavior critical for identification, interpretation and storage of socially meaningful information. Social recognition develops throughout childhood and adolescent, and is affected in a wide variety of psychiatric disorders. Recently, new data appeared on the molecular mechanisms of these processes, particularly, the excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) ratio which is modified during development, and then E/I balance is established in the adult brain. While E/I imbalance has been proposed as a mechanism for schizophrenia, it also seems to be the common mechanism in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In addition, there is a strong suggestion that the oxytocinergic system is related to GABA-mediated E/I control in the context of brain socialization. In this review, we attempt to summarize the underpinning molecular mechanisms of E/I balance and its imbalance, and related biomarkers in the brain in healthiness and pathology. In addition, because there are increasing interest on oxytocin in the social neuroscience field, we will pay intensive attention to the role of oxytocin in maintaining E/I balance from the viewpoint of its effects on improving social impairment in psychiatric diseases, especially in ASD.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Audiovisual multisensory integration in individuals with autism spectrum disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis.An ever-growing literature has aimed to determine how individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) differ from their typically developing (TD) peers on measures of multisensory integration (MSI) and to ascertain the degree to which differences in MSI are associated with the broad range of symptoms associated with ASD. Findings, however, have been highly variable across the studies carried out to date. The present work systematically reviews and quantitatively synthesizes the large literature on audiovisual MSI in individuals with ASD to evaluate the cumulative evidence for (a) group differences between individuals with ASD and TD peers, (b) correlations between MSI and autism symptoms in individuals with ASD and (c) study level factors that may moderate findings (i.e., explain differential effects) observed across studies. To identify eligible studies, a comprehensive search strategy was employed using the ProQuest search engine, PubMed database, forwards and backwards citation searches, direct author contact, and hand-searching of select conference proceedings. A significant between-group difference in MSI was evident in the literature, with individuals with ASD demonstrating worse audiovisual integration on average across studies compared to TD controls. This effect was moderated by mean participant age, such that between-group differences were more pronounced in younger samples. The mean correlation between MSI and autism and related symptomatology was also significant, indicating that increased audiovisual integration in individuals with ASD is associated with better language/communication abilities and/or reduced autism symptom severity in the extant literature. This effect was moderated by whether the stimuli were linguistic versus non-linguistic in nature, such that correlation magnitudes tended to be significantly greater when linguistic stimuli were utilized in the measure of MSI. Limitations and future directions for primary and meta-analytic research are discussed.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Do Beliefs About Whether Others Can See Modulate Social Seeking in Autism?Autistic people process gaze differently than typical people, but it is not yet clear if these differences lie in the processing of eye-shapes or the belief in whether others can see (perceptual mentalizing). We aimed to investigate whether these two models of gaze processing modulate social seeking in typical and autistic adults. We measured preferences of participants to view videos of an actress with visible or hidden eyes, who can or cannot see out. While typical participants preferred videos where the actress can see through and has visible eyes, autistic people showed no preference for these videos. These findings are discussed in the context of perceptual mentalizing and the social motivation theory of autism.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Apgar score and risk of autism.Low Apgar score has been associated with higher risk for several neurological and psychiatric disorders, including cerebral palsy and intellectual disability. Studies of the association between Apgar score and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been inconsistent. We aimed to investigate (1) the association between low Apgar score at 5 min and risk for ASD, and (2) the modifying effects of gestational age and sex on this association in the largest multinational database of ASD. We included prospective data from 5.5 million individuals and over 33,000 cases of ASD from Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Western Australia who were born between 1984 and 2007. We calculated crude and adjusted risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the associations between low Apgar score and ASD. All analyses for ASD were repeated for autistic disorder (AD). We used interaction terms and stratified analysis to investigate the effects of sex, gestational age, and birth weight on the association. In fully adjusted models, low Apgar scores (1-3) (RR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.16-1.74), and intermediate Apgar scores (4-6) (RR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.36-1.65) were associated with a higher RR of ASD than optimal Apgar score (7-10). The point estimates for low (RR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.41-2.51) and intermediate Apgar score (RR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.32-1.81) were larger for AD than for ASD. This study suggests that low Apgar score is associated with higher risk of ASD, and in particular AD. We did not observe any major modifying effects of gestational age and sex, although there seems to be substantial confounding by gestational age and birth weight on the observed association.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Estimating contribution of rare non-coding variants to neuropsychiatric disorders.Owing to recent advances in DNA sequencing technology, a number of large-scale comprehensive analyses of genetic variations in protein-coding regions (i.e., whole-exome sequencing studies), have been conducted for neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders, intellectual disability, and schizophrenia. These studies, especially those focusing on de novo (newly arising) mutations and extremely rare variants, have successfully identified previously unrecognized disease genes/mutations with a large effect size and deepen our understanding of the biology of neuropsychiatric diseases. Along with the continuously dropping sequencing cost, now the target of sequencing studies is expanding from the exome to the whole human genome. Several pioneering works have provided important insights into the contribution of rare non-coding variants to neuropsychiatric diseases. At the same time, these studies highlight need for further larger sample sizes and improvement in annotation of non-coding regulatory variants. In this review, key findings from recent studies as well as likely future directions are overviewed.\n",

We examined the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of delivering the Group-Early Start Denver Model to children with autism spectrum disorder in inclusive versus specialized classrooms. We randomly assigned 44 preschoolers with autism spectrum disorder to receive the Group-Early Start Denver Model across one school calendar year in classrooms that included only children with autism spectrum disorder or mostly children who were typically developing. Blind-rated indicators of teaching quality showed similar results across settings, which were above the local benchmark. Children showed improvements across blinded proximal measures of spontaneous vocalization, social interaction, and imitation and across distal measures of verbal cognition, adaptive behavior, and autism symptoms irrespective of intervention setting. Mothers of participants experienced a reduction in stress irrespective of child intervention setting. Across both settings, age at intervention start was negatively associated with gains in verbal cognition. Delivery of Group-Early Start Denver Model in an inclusive setting appeared to be feasible, with no significant differences in teaching quality and child improvements when the program was implemented in inclusive versus specialized classrooms.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The roles of neighborhood composition and autism prevalence on vaccination exemption pockets: A population-wide study.The number of children entering schools without mandated vaccinations has increased in high-income countries due to the rise of nonmedical exemptions from school vaccination requirements. Herd immunity is threatened when unvaccinated children are concentrated in spatial pockets. Despite the role of vaccine-autism controversy in the current wave of the anti-vaccine movement, we do not know if exemption clusters are associated with local autism rates; it is often assumed that these clusters are merely the result of sociodemographic composition. This study uses data on the number of students with a Personal Belief Exemption reported by schools from 1992 to 2014 and unique data on the locations of children with an autism diagnosis in California to study the correlates of large exemption pockets. Our spatial analysis shows that the prevalence of autism is not associated with the locations of large pockets of vaccination exemptions. Likewise, the spatial distributions of socioeconomic factors and proximity to health care resources have limited roles in explaining these large exemption pockets. Racial/ethnic composition, however, has strong associations with the locations of the large pockets. Our results suggest that community-level interventions are needed to maintain herd immunity as exemption pockets are not merely the result of population composition.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The way others move can influence what we choose.Whether pointing at a menu item or rifling through a clothes rack, when we choose we often move. We investigated whether people's tendency to copy the movements of others could influence their choices. Participants saw pairs of pictures in private and indicated which one they preferred. They then entered a virtual art gallery and saw the same picture pairs in the presence of a virtual character. Having observed the virtual character point to indicate her preference with either a high or low movement trajectory, participants indicated their preference. There was either an anatomical (same movement, same choice) or spatial correspondence (same movement, different choice) between the participant's pictures and those of the virtual character. We found that participants copied the movement made by the virtual character rather than her action goal (i.e., her choice of picture). This resulted in a shift towards the virtual character's preferences in the anatomical condition but away from her preferences in the spatial condition. This effect was driven by the observation of the virtual character's high pointing movements. In a further experiment, we did not find any significant differences in imitation behaviour in autism, although autistic participants were less consistent in their choices. Our findings demonstrate that we are not only influenced by other's choices but also the types of movements others make to indicate those choices.\n",

In cultured hippocampus slices prepared from neonatal mice, pharmacological inhibition of MET kinase activity suppresses dendritic arborization and disrupts normal dendritic spine development.

We recently demonstrated that cerebellar dysfunction is sufficient to generate autistic-like behaviors in a mouse model of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Here, using the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)-specific inhibitor rapamycin, we define distinct sensitive periods for treatment of autistic-like behaviors with sensitive periods extending into adulthood for social behaviors. We identify cellular and electrophysiological parameters that may contribute to behavioral rescue, with rescue of Purkinje cell survival and excitability corresponding to social behavioral rescue. In addition, using anatomic and diffusion-based MRI, we identify structural changes in cerebellar domains implicated in ASD that correlate with sensitive periods of specific autism-like behaviors. These findings thus not only define treatment parameters into adulthood, but also support a mechanistic basis for the targeted rescue of autism-related behaviors.\n",

Although the previous studies have investigated methods for quantifying hyperacusis in ASD, appropriate physiological signs for quantifying hyperacusis in ASD remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the relationship of loudness tolerance with the threshold of the stapedial reflex and with contralateral suppression of the distortion product otoacoustic emissions, which has been suggested to be related to hyperacusis in people without ASD. We tested an ASD group and a neurotypical group. The results revealed that only the stapedial reflex threshold was significantly correlated with loudness tolerance in both groups.

Here, we performed the first investigation of how age-related changes in functional brain connectivity may be expressed differently in females and males with ASD. We analyzed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 107 typically developing (TD) females, 114 TD males, 104 females, and 115 males with ASD (6-26 years) from the autism brain imaging data exchange repository. We explored how interhemispheric homotopic connectivity and its maturational curvatures change across groups. Differences between ASD and TD and between females and males with ASD were observed for the rate of changes in connectivity in the absence of overall differences in connectivity. The largest portion of variance in age-related changes in connectivity was described through similarities between TD males, ASD males, and ASD females, in contrast to TD females. We found that shape of developmental curvature is associated with symptomatology in both males and females with ASD. We demonstrated that females and males with ASD tended to follow the male pattern of developmental changes in interhemispheric connectivity, supporting the EMB theory of ASD.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Genetic mutations in CaDendritic morphology is a critical determinant of neuronal connectivity, and calcium signaling plays a predominant role in shaping dendrites. Altered dendritic morphology and genetic mutations in calcium signaling are both associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). In this study we tested the hypothesis that dendritic arborization and NDD-relevant behavioral phenotypes are altered by human mutations that modulate calcium-dependent signaling pathways implicated in NDDs. The dendritic morphology of pyramidal neurons in CA1 hippocampus and somatosensory cortex was quantified in Golgi-stained brain sections from juvenile mice of both sexes expressing either a human gain-of-function mutation in ryanodine receptor 1 (T4826I-RYR1), a human CGG repeat expansion (170-200 CGG repeats) in the fragile X mental retardation gene 1 (FMR1 premutation), both mutations (double mutation; DM), or wildtype mice. In hippocampal neurons, increased dendritic arborization was observed in male T4826I-RYR1 and, to a lesser extent, male FMR1 premutation neurons. Dendritic morphology of cortical neurons was altered in both sexes of FMR1 premutation and DM animals with the most pronounced differences seen in DM females. Genotype also impaired behavior, as assessed using the three-chambered social approach test. The most striking lack of sociability was observed in DM male and female mice. In conclusion, mutations that alter the fidelity of calcium signaling enhance dendritic arborization in a brain region- and sex-specific manner and impair social behavior in juvenile mice. The phenotypic outcomes of these mutations likely provide a susceptible biological substrate for additional environmental stressors that converge on calcium signaling to determine individual NDD risk.\n",

Moreover, impaired FER and FEE are frequently seen in other disorders and problem behaviors. We describe the development of a novel system to detect and give real-time feedback on these processes, termed facial emotion expression training (FEET), an automated, gamelike system that is based on 3-dimensional sensing (Kinect) technology. A sample of 40 children (n = 20 ASD, n = 20 typically developing) interacted with our prototype system, which presented audiovisual stimuli and assessed responses of participants. Overall, consumer satisfaction ratings were high, and youth with ASD reported enjoying interacting with the system more than did the typical youth. Results suggest that new technology-based interventions are acceptable to consumers and viable for use in remediation of transdiagnostic processes, such as FER and FEE. Implications for future technology-based intervention to target transdiagnostic processes are discussed.\n",

      "ABSTRACT EEG-based multi-feature fusion assessment for autism.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder which affects the developmental trajectory in several behavioral domains, including impairments of social communication, cognitive and language abilities. In this paper, multi-feature fusion method based on EEG signal is used to extract as many as possible features including power spectrum analysis, bicoherence, entropy and coherence methods, then we use minimum redundancy maximum correlation (mRMR) algorithm to choose the features, which are applied to input to three classifiers to obtain accuracy classification results. We try to find some key biomarkers of ASD by examining the accuracy of classifier, using different models which use the combination of multiplex features. The results show when nine features are selected by SVM-linear classifier, the accuracy is up to 91.38%. This method might provide objective basis for clinical diagnosis of autism.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Weighted Walking Influences Lower Extremity Coordination in Children on the Autism Spectrum.There is sparse quantitative research regarding gait coordination patterns of children on the autism spectrum, though previous studies, relying only upon observational data, have alluded to characteristically poor movement coordination. This study compared walking with a weighted vest, a backpack carriage, and an unloaded walking condition on lower extremity coordination among 10 male children (aged 8-17 years) on the autism spectrum. All participants completed 15 gait trials in the following three conditions: (a) unloaded, (b) wearing a backpack weighted with 15% body mass, and (c) wearing a vest weighted with 15% body mass. We used continuous relative phase analysis to quantify lower extremity coordination and analyzed data through both group and single-subject comparisons. We used the Model Statistic to test for statistical significance at each of the normalized data points for each segment couple (thigh-leg, leg-foot, and thigh-foot). The first 10 and last 10 stride blocks were tested for possible accommodation strategies. Group comparisons revealed no coordination changes among the three conditions (likely due to insufficient statistical power), while single-subject comparisons exposed significant decreased variability in gait coordination patterns ( p < .05) in both loaded conditions, relative to the unloaded condition. These participants exhibited variable coordination patterns during the unloaded gait. When walking with loads, coordination pattern variability of the lower extremities was decreased. This finding suggests that walking while carrying or wearing heavy objects may reduce the number of potential motor pattern choices and thus decrease the overall variability of lower extremity movement patterns. Additional research with a larger and more diverse participant sample is required to confirm this conclusion.\n",

Equine therapy is an alternative multimodal intervention that involves utilizing a horse to enhance core impairments in ASD. Recent systematic reviews in this area have several limitations including inclusion of populations other than ASD, assessment of a variety of animal-assisted interventions other than equine therapy, and a failure to conduct quantitative analyses to provide accurate effect size estimates. We conducted a focused systematic review to address these limitations. Our review suggested that equine therapy has beneficial effects on behavioral skills and to some extent on social communication in ASD. The evidence for positive effects of equine therapy on perceptuo-motor, cognitive, and functional skills is currently limited.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The Role of Vitamin D in Fertility and during Pregnancy and Lactation: A Review of Clinical Data.Vitamin D deficiency is common and there exists a huge gap between recommended dietary vitamin D intakes and the poor vitamin D supply in the general population. While vitamin D is important for musculoskeletal health, there are accumulating data suggesting that vitamin D may also be important for fertility, pregnancy outcomes and lactation. Significant changes in vitamin D metabolism during pregnancy such as increased production of the \"active vitamin D hormone\" calcitriol support the important role of vitamin D in this setting. Observational studies show that vitamin D deficiency is a risk marker for reduced fertility and various adverse pregnancy outcomes and is associated with a low vitamin D content of breast milk. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) document that physiological vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy is safe and improves vitamin D and calcium status, thereby protecting skeletal health. Although certain RCTs and/or meta-analyses reported some other beneficial effects, it is still not clear whether vitamin D supplementation improves fertility or decreases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as low birth weight, pre-eclampsia and neonatal mortality, or reduces wheeze/asthma in the infants. Nevertheless, vitamin D supplementation in pregnant women is frequently required to achieve a sufficient vitamin D status as recommended by nutritional vitamin D guidelines. In this review, we provide an overview of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and large trials reporting clinical data on the role of vitamin D for fertility, pregnancy and lactation.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Facilitation of biological motion processing by group-based autism specific social skills training.Abnormalities in neurophysiological correlates of social perception are a well-known feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, little is known if and how ASD specific behavioral interventions may affect neural processing in ASD. The aim of the current study was to investigate for the first time, whether the group-based social skills training SOSTA-FRA would elicit changes in neurophysiological correlates of social perception in high-functioning ASD individuals aged 8-17 years. Event-related potentials (ERPs) of a facial emotion recognition (FER) and a biological motion perception task were examined. ERPs were compared between a randomized intervention and a treatment as usual group at three time points (baseline, post-intervention, and at 3 months follow-up). A reduction of P100 amplitude in the right hemisphere and a trend toward reduced N200 latency in the biological motion task were found after the training only in the intervention group, whereas behavioral performance remained stable. Change in N200 latencies and parent-rated social responsiveness showed small but statistically nonsignificant correlations. No changes were observed regarding FER. Results indicate that the intervention changed neural correlates of social perception in ASD. Especially neural correlates of biological motion perception, which is an important prerequisite for successful social interaction, were sensitive to change. ERPs of social perception tasks that are impaired in ASD can well be used to objectively measure neural processing improvement by behavioral intervention. Autism Res 2018, 11: 1376-1387. © 2018 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: It is well known that people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) process social information differently than other people and that these differences can also be seen in their brain activity. We also know that behavioral therapies, such as group-based social skills trainings can help people with ASD improve their behavior. But it is unclear how therapy changes social processing in the brain. The aim of our study was therefore to examine how neural processing of social stimuli changed after behavioral intervention. Comparing a group of children and adolescents that received the group-based social skills training SOSTA-FRA to a control group we found that the neural processing of human motion became faster and involved less brain resources after the intervention, while behavioral performance remained stable. No changes were seen for the processing of emotional facial expressions. We recommend that future studies should also analyze changes in brain function as well as behavioral changes as a secondary therapy outcome parameter.\n",

Data were drawn from Scotland's Census 2011. We calculated the percentage with autism, their extent of comorbid conditions, odds ratio (with 95% confidence intervals) of autism predicting comorbidities, adjusted for age and gender, and odds ratio for age and gender predicting comorbidities within the cohort with autism. A total of 25,063/1,548,819 (1.6%) had autism: 19,880 (79.3%) males and 5183 (20.7%) females. Autism had an odds ratio of 5.4 (5.1-5.6) for predicting deafness/partial hearing loss, odds ratio of 8.9 (8.1-9.7) for blindness/partial sight loss, odds ratio of 49.7 (38.1-64.9) for intellectual disabilities, odds ratio of 15.7 (13.4-18.5) for mental health conditions, odds ratio of 15.8 (14.1-17.8) for physical disability and odds ratio of 3.9 (3.8-4.0) for other conditions. Females with autism were more likely to have each additional condition than males, including intellectual disabilities, suggesting they may have more severe autism than males and adding evidence that autism may be currently underdiagnosed in more intellectually able females. These conditions are disabling and have a significant impact on long-term quality of life; their coexistence with autism adds extra complexity. It is important to raise clinicians' awareness of this extent of comorbidity, and to have accurate prevalence data to plan prevention and intervention measures, and to follow health inequality trends.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Effects of Exergaming on Physical and Cognitive Functions in Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Systematic Review.The increase in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) population triggers a deep concern within public health. This alarming trend stresses the need for the development of effective strategies that might aid with this growing population. Exergaming has several advantages as an ASD intervention, such as flexible play, a private space for exercise, and diverse types of physical activity. The study aims to analyze the effectiveness of exergaming interventions on individuals with ASD. The systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Studies which employed exergaming interventions on individuals with ASD were considered for inclusion. Exergaming-related changes in participants' physical and cognitive functions were the main interest of the current review. Ten articles satisfied the predetermined eligibility criteria. Thematic coding categorized the main outcomes into two higher-order themes and five subthemes. The higher-order themes were physical performance and cognitive performance. The emerged subthemes were physical fitness, motor performance, intensity of physical activity, executive function, and self-perception. Following exergame interventions, individuals with ASD indicated significant improvements in physical fitness, executive function, and self-perception. Exergaming also increased participation in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. In contrast, exergaming indicated small impact on emotional regulation and did not provide adequate opportunities for motor skill development. It is worth noting that only one randomized controlled trial was included in the current review. Future research would require more rigorous study designs to provide reliable evidence on the effectiveness of exergaming interventions for individuals with ASD. Exergaming interventions lead to improved physical and cognitive functions in individuals with ASD. It is suggested that exergaming be used as a feasible supplement to traditional physical activity programs for individuals with ASD.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Evidence for Brainstem Contributions to Autism Spectrum Disorders.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects one in 59 children in the United States. Although there is a mounting body of knowledge of cortical and cerebellar contributions to ASD, our knowledge about the early developing brainstem in ASD is only beginning to accumulate. Understanding how brainstem neurotransmission is implicated in ASD is important because many of this condition's sensory and motor symptoms are consistent with brainstem pathology. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to integrate epidemiological, behavioral, histological, neuroimaging, and animal evidence of brainstem contributions to ASD. Because ASD is a neurodevelopmental condition, we examined the available data through a lens of hierarchical brain development. The review of the literature suggests that developmental alterations of the brainstem could have potential cascading effects on cortical and cerebellar formation, ultimately leading to ASD symptoms. This view is supported by human epidemiology findings and data from animal models of ASD, showing that perturbed development of the brainstem substructures, particularly during the peak formation of the brainstem's monoaminergic centers, may relate to ASD or ASD-like behaviors. Furthermore, we review evidence from human histology, psychophysiology, and neuroimaging suggesting that brainstem development and maturation may be atypical in ASD and may be related to key ASD symptoms, such as atypical sensorimotor features and social responsiveness. From this review there emerges the need of future research to validate early detection of the brainstem-based somatosensory and psychophysiological behaviors that emerge in infancy, and to examine the brainstem across the life span, while accounting for age. In all, there is preliminary evidence for brainstem involvement in ASD, but a better understanding of the brainstem's role would likely pave the way for earlier diagnosis and treatment of ASD.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Associations between polygenic risk scores for four psychiatric illnesses and brain structure using multivariate pattern recognition.Psychiatric illnesses are complex and polygenic. They are associated with widespread alterations in the brain, which are partly influenced by genetic factors. There have been some attempts to relate polygenic risk scores (PRS) - a measure of the overall genetic risk an individual carries for a disorder - to brain structure using univariate methods. However, PRS are likely associated with distributed and covarying effects across the brain. We therefore used multivariate machine learning in this proof-of-principle study to investigate associations between brain structure and PRS for four psychiatric disorders; attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. The sample included 213 individuals comprising patients with depression (69), bipolar disorder (33), and healthy controls (111).

      "ABSTRACT School-related anxiety symptomatology in a community sample of primary-school-aged children on the autism spectrum.Although it is recognized that the prevalence of anxiety is elevated in children with autism spectrum disorder, there has been very limited research exploring such anxiety in school contexts. As a result, there is limited detailed information for teachers or educators on how anxiety in autism may present in the school setting for children on the autism spectrum.

This study examined aspects of feasibility of the Autism Navigator® for Primary Care in one LMIC, South Africa. A mixed-methods quasi-experimental design was used to examine relevant professionals' implementation of the course and measure changes in their knowledge of red flags after training. Perceptions of the acceptability, demand, and practicality of the course were explored in focus groups. Sixty-two providers completed the course online with a 94% completion rate. Built-in learner assessment pass rates ranged from 88% to 100%. Second-language English speakers took longer to complete the learner assessments, and professionals with less access to the Internet spent less time in the course. Participants' perceptions of the acceptability, demand, and practicality of the course were mostly positive with some suggestions made for local conditions. Results supported the feasibility of the course in this LMIC with some supports required pertaining to language and Internet access. We propose that this training has the potential to lower the age of detection of ASD in South Africa and other LMICs.

LAY SUMMARY: Professionals in low- and middle-income countries urgently need training to recognize red flags of autism in very young children. The feasibility of utilizing the Autism Navigator® for Primary Care course for this training was explored with 62 South African professionals. After training, professionals' knowledge of early red flags improved, and most reported the course important and needed in South Africa. They found the web-based design mostly acceptable, practical, and culturally applicable. The course could help lower the age of autism detection.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Fathers Raising Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: Stories of Marital Stability as Key to Parenting Success.Using media reports of high divorce rates among couples of children with ASD as a point of departure, our purpose in this paper is to examine how married fathers of children with ASD understand their marriages relative to the demands of ASD and in the context of media reports of elevated divorce rates among parents raising children with ASD. We begin with a review of select literature pertaining to the impact of ASD on marriages and we include a brief account of popular media portrayals of the influence of having a child with a developmental disability, and ASD in particular, on marriages. We then describe our qualitative examination of narrative interview data from 26 married fathers raising children with ASD aged 2-13 beginning with our theoretical anchoring in social comparison to focus our attention on how fathers compare themselves with media accounts of elevated divorce rates among parents of children and also with other hypothetical family configurations. Our findings are evidence of fathers' strong and strengthened commitments to marriages and we illustrate a re-purposing of inflated portrayals of divorce rates to shore up fathers' sense of their own effectiveness as husbands and fathers.\n",

Behavioural interventions, such as applied behavioural analysis, are evidence-based practices for children with IDD and should be the first-line treatment. Short-term use of psychotropic medications may be helpful in reducing the severity and frequency of challenging behaviours while evidence-based behavioural interventions are pursued.

      "ABSTRACT Neural self-representation in autistic women and association with 'compensatory camouflaging'.Prior work has revealed sex/gender-dependent autistic characteristics across behavioural and neural/biological domains. It remains unclear whether and how neural sex/gender differences are related to behavioural sex/gender differences in autism. Here, we examined whether atypical neural responses during mentalizing and self-representation are sex/gender-dependent in autistic adults and explored whether 'camouflaging' (acting as if behaviourally neurotypical) is associated with sex/gender-dependent neural responses. In total, N = 119 adults (33 typically developing males, 29 autistic males, 29 typically developing females and 28 autistic females) participated in a task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm to assess neural activation within right temporo-parietal junction and ventromedial prefrontal cortex during mentalizing and self-representation. Camouflaging in autism was quantified as the discrepancy between extrinsic behaviour in social-interpersonal contexts and intrinsic status. While autistic men showed hypoactive right temporo-parietal junction mentalizing and ventromedial prefrontal cortex self-representation responses compared to typically developing men, such neural responses in autistic women were not different from typically developing women. In autistic women only, increasing camouflaging was associated with heightened ventromedial prefrontal cortex self-representation response. There is a lack of impaired neural self-representation and mentalizing in autistic women compared to typically developing women. Camouflaging is heightened in autistic women and may relate to neural self-representation response. These results reveal brain-behaviour relations that help explain sex/gender-heterogeneity in social brain function in autism.\n",

In this study, ten parents and ten educators were interviewed about their views and experiences of supporting these girls through puberty. Results demonstrated that many parents had concerns prior to the onset of puberty in these girls. Yet, for most girls, experiences of puberty were felt to be positive, with the girls coping well with changes that they were experiencing (e.g. menstruation, breast development and developing body hair).

      "ABSTRACT Diagnostic and Severity-Tracking Biomarkers for Autism Spectrum Disorder.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder afflicting about one in every 68 children. It is behaviorally diagnosed based on a triad of symptoms, including impairment in communication, impairment in sociability and abnormal and stereotypic behavior. The subjectivity of behavioral diagnosis urges the need for clinical biomarker tests to improve and complement ASD diagnosis and treatment. Over the past two decades, researchers garnered a broad range of biomarkers associated with ASD and often correlating with the severity of ASD, which includes metabolic and genetic biomarkers or neuroimaging abnormalities. Metabolic biomarkers are either involved in key pathways such as a trans-sulfuration pathway or produced due to the derangement of these pathways in the case of oxidative stress. Recent studies reported several genetic abnormalities related to ASD, encompassing various mechanisms, from copy number variations (CNVs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to chromosomal anomalies. However, it is still premature to consider these genetic variants as true biomarkers for ASD, due to their low reproducibility and regional-specific nature. Herein, we comprehensively review state of the art about major biomarkers reported in ASD and the association of some biomarkers with ASD symptoms and severity. It is important to establish those biomarkers to be able to help in the diagnosis and to optimize the treatment of ASD.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Lacosamide for SCN2A-related intractable neonatal and infantile seizures.Voltage-gated sodium channel alpha subunit 2 (SCN2A) gene mutations are associated with neonatal seizures and a wide range of epilepsy syndromes. Previous reports suggest that traditional sodium channel blockers (SCBs) such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine have a beneficial effect on SCN2A-related neonatal seizures, as they counteract the gain-of-function effect of mutated Nav1.2 channels. Additionally, SCBs are beneficial against other sodium and potassium channel-related neonatal seizures. There are, however, few reports describing the effect of the new SCB lacosamide against neonatal and infantile epileptic seizures. We report herein two neonates with intractable neonatal seizures with SCN2A pathogenic missense variants. Both infants showed temporary seizure relief following IV administrations of phenytoin, but were resistant to a combination of antiepileptic drugs, while complete seizure control was achieved following lacosamide administration. We suggest that SCBs, e.g. phenytoin, should be introduced early for refractory neonatal seizures of non-lesional and presumably genetic origin. If any beneficial response to a SCB is noted, this should prompt an initiation of additional SCBs. New clinical trials will provide data on the efficacy and safety of the new SCB lacosamide for genetic neonatal seizures and perhaps neonatal seizures in general.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Assessing intelligence at autism diagnosis: mission impossible? Testability and cognitive profile of autistic preschoolers.Intelligence in minimally verbal children on the autism spectrum (AS) is at risk of being underestimated. The present study investigated testability and cognitive profile of preschool autistic children using conventional tools and strength-informed tools. Fifty-two AS children and fifty-four typical children matched on age (31-77 months) were assessed. Testability increased with age in both groups, was generally lower in AS children, but not related to their test performance. Typical children performed significantly better than AS children on conventional tools, but performance of both groups was similar on strength-informed tools. Differences of performance across tests were much greater in the AS group. These results emphasize the heterogenous, yet characteristic, cognitive profile in preschool children, and introduce the usefulness of flexible testing.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Dissociations in the neural substrates of language and social functioning in autism spectrum disorder.Impairments in social communication (coupled with intact nonsocial language skills) are common in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the neural correlates of these social communication deficits in adolescents and young adults with ASD are not fully understood. The communication checklist self-report (CC-SR) was administered to adolescents and young adults with ASD (n = 52) and typically developing (TD) controls (n = 64) to assess structural-language, pragmatic-language, and social-engagement. One high-resolution T1-weighted structural image was obtained from each participant. FreeSurfer was used to quantify cortical thickness. A main effect of diagnosis, with the ASD group performing worse than the TD group on all three CC-SR scales, and a diagnosis by scale interaction, driven by low social-engagement self-ratings in the ASD group, were found. There were also group differences in the relationship between scores on two of the three CC-SR scales and cortical thickness in multiple regions (pragmatic-language: left rostral frontal; social-engagement: left medial prefrontal). These interactions were driven by poorer self-ratings of language/social skills associated with decreased cortical thickness in the ASD group, while in the TD group worse self-ratings were associated with thicker cortex. Self-ratings of language/social-communication were lower in the ASD than the TD group. Moreover, language/social-communication self-ratings showed a different relationship with cortical thickness for the ASD and TD groups in the left inferior frontal region for pragmatic language ratings and the left medial prefrontal cortex for social engagement ratings. These findings suggest thinner cortex is associated with more impaired pragmatic language and social communication abilities in ASD.

We utilized thickness of the cerebral cortex as a measure of brain structure, and we found different correlations between language or social communication ability and cortical thickness in distinct regions for the ASD and TD groups. These findings suggest that for regions implicated in language/social communication ability, decreased cortical thickness is associated with more impaired pragmatic language and social communication abilities in ASD.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Correlations between features of event-related potentials and Autism Spectrum Quotient scores.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder and is characterized by deficits in social communication and social interaction. ASD includes a continuum from mild to severe expression of autistic traits. The purpose of the present study was to investigate correlations between event-related potentials (ERPs) during visual-auditory priming, and Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) scores, which include subscores in 5 different areas: social skills, attention switching, attention to detail, communication, and imagination. High-density electroencephalograms were recorded while participants performed a visual-auditory priming task that required categorization of auditory stimuli presented following a semantically congruent or incongruent visual primer. Differences in ERPs to auditory targets following semantically congruent and incongruent primers occurred between 200 ms and 600 ms at the posterior temporal electrodes. Amplitudes associated with incongruent auditory stimuli at P7 were negatively correlated with overall AQ scores, and positively correlated with communication subscores. Amplitudes associated with congruent stimuli were positively correlated with attention to detail subscores. In addition, PO7 amplitudes were negatively correlated with communication subscores. The results demonstrate significant correlations between electrophysiological features of cross-modal priming and AQ scores. Our findings suggest that electrophysiological parameters may be useful tools to evaluate the severity of autistic trait expression.\n",

However, we know little about the neural basis of the overlaps and distinctions between these disorders, particularly in young adulthood - a critical time window for brain plasticity across executive and socioemotional domains. Here, we systematically review 75 articles investigating ADHD and ASD in young adult samples (mean ages 16-26) using cognitive tasks, with neural activity concurrently measured via electroencephalography (EEG) - the most accessible neuroimaging technology. The majority of studies focused on event-related potentials (ERPs), with some beginning to capitalise on oscillatory approaches. Overlapping and specific profiles for ASD and ADHD were found mainly for four neurocognitive domains: attention processing, performance monitoring, face processing and sensory processing. No studies in this age group directly compared both disorders or considered dual diagnosis with both disorders. Moving forward, understanding of ADHD, ASD and their overlap in young adulthood would benefit from an increased focus on cross-disorder comparisons, using similar paradigms and in well-powered samples and longitudinal cohorts.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Social Stimulus Causes Aberrant Activation of the Medial Prefrontal Cortex in a Mouse Model With Autism-Like Behaviors.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly prevalent and genetically heterogeneous brain disorder. Developing effective therapeutic interventions requires knowledge of the brain regions that malfunction and how they malfunction during ASD-relevant behaviors. Our study provides insights into brain regions activated by a novel social stimulus and how the activation pattern differs between mice that display autism-like disabilities and control littermates. Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) conditional knockout (cKO) mice display reduced social interest, increased repetitive behaviors and dysfunction of the β-catenin pathway, a convergent target of numerous ASD-linked human genes. Here, we exposed the mice to a novel social vs. non-social stimulus and measured neuronal activation by immunostaining for the protein c-Fos. We analyzed three brain regions known to play a role in social behavior. Compared with control littermates, APC cKOs display excessive activation, as evidenced by an increased number of excitatory pyramidal neurons stained for c-Fos in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), selectively in the infralimbic sub-region. In contrast, two other social brain regions, the medial amygdala and piriform cortex show normal levels of neuron activation. Additionally, APC cKOs exhibit increased frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the infralimbic sub-region. Further, immunostaining is reduced for the inhibitory interneuron markers parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SST) in the APC cKO mPFC. Our findings suggest aberrant excitatory-inhibitory balance and activation patterns. As β-catenin is a core pathway in ASD, we identify the infralimbic sub-region of the mPFC as a critical brain region for autism-relevant social behavior.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Altered lateralization of dorsal language tracts in 6-week-old infants at risk for autism.Altered structural connectivity has been identified as a possible biomarker of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk in the developing brain. Core features of ASD include impaired social communication and early language delay. Thus, examining white matter tracts associated with language may lend further insight into early signs of ASD risk and the mechanisms that underlie language impairments associated with the disorder. Evidence of altered structural connectivity has previously been detected in 6-month-old infants at high familial risk for developing ASD. However, as language processing begins in utero, differences in structural connectivity between language regions may be present in the early infant brain shortly after birth. Here we investigated key white matter pathways of the dorsal language network in 6-week-old infants at high (HR) and low (LR) risk for ASD to identify atypicalities in structural connectivity that may predict altered developmental trajectories prior to overt language delays and the onset of ASD symptomatology. Compared to HR infants, LR infants showed higher fractional anisotropy (FA) in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF); in contrast, in the right SLF, HR infants showed higher FA than LR infants. Additionally, HR infants showed more rightward lateralization of the SLF. Across both groups, measures of FA and lateralization of these pathways at 6 weeks of age were related to later language development at 18 months of age as well as ASD symptomatology at 36 months of age. These findings indicate that early differences in the structure of language pathways may provide an early predictor of future language development and ASD risk.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Enhanced Early Visual Responses During Implicit Emotional Faces Processing in Autism Spectrum Disorder.Research on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has focused on processing of socially-relevant stimuli, such as faces. Nonetheless, before being 'social', faces are visual stimuli. The present magnetoencephalography study investigated the time course of brain activity during an implicit emotional task in visual emotion-related regions in 19 adults with ASD (mean age 26.3 ± 4.4) and 19 typically developed controls (26.4 ± 4). The results confirmed previously-reported differences between groups in brain responses to emotion and a hypo-activation in the ASD group in the right fusiform gyrus around 150 ms. However, the ASD group also presented early enhanced activity in the occipital region. These results support that impaired face processing in ASD might be sustained by atypical responses in primary visual areas.\n",

The main clinical features are a typical craniofacial appearance, growth deficiency, developmental delays, and seizures. Previous genotype-phenotype correlation analyses showed some candidate regions for each clinical finding. The WHS critical region has been narrowed into the region 2 Mb from the telomere, which includes LETM1 and WHSC1; however, this region is insufficient to cause \"typical WHS facial appearance\". In this study, we identified 10 patients with a deletion involving 4p16.3. Five patients showed pure terminal deletions and three showed unbalanced translocations. The remaining patients showed an interstitial deletion and a suspected inverted-duplication-deletion. Among 10 patients, one patient did not show \"typical WHS facial appearance\" although his interstitial deletion included LETM1 and WHSC1. On the other hand, another patient exhibited \"typical WHS facial appearance\" although her small deletion did not include LETM1 and WHSC1. Instead, FGFRL1 was considered as the candidate for this finding. The largest deletion of 34.7 Mb was identified in a patient with the most severe phenotype of WHS.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Labelling faces as 'Autistic' reduces the inversion effect.Does the belief that a face belongs to an individual with autism affect recognition of that face? To address this question, we used the inversion effect as a marker of face recognition. In Experiment 1, participants completed a recognition task involving upright and inverted faces labelled as either 'regular' or 'autistic'. In reality, the faces presented in both conditions were identical. Results revealed a smaller inversion effect for faces labelled as autistic. Thus, simply labelling a face as 'autistic' disrupts recognition. Experiment 2 showed a larger inversion effect after the provision of humanizing versus dehumanizing information about faces labelled as 'autistic'. We suggest changes in the inversion effect could be used as a measure to study stigma within the context of objectification and dehumanization.\n",

Studies of children with ASD have not identified an association between incremental language processing in semantically-constraining contexts and language skills, perhaps because participants were adolescents and/or children with strong language skills. This study examined incremental language processing and receptive language in young children with ASD with a range of language skills. Children showed a head start when presented with semantically-constraining verbs (e.g., Read the book) compared to neutral verbs (e.g., Find the book).

Neuroimaging has revealed numerous findings of atypical activity and connectivity of 'social brain' networks, yet no consensus view on crucial developmental causes of SC deficits has emerged. Aside from methodological challenges, the deeper problem concerns the clinical label of ASD. While genetic studies have not comprehensively explained the causes of nonsyndromic ASDs, they highlight that the clinical label encompasses many etiologically different disorders. The question of how potential causes and etiologies converge onto a comparatively narrow set of SC deficits remains. Only neuroimaging designs searching for subtypes within ASD cohorts (rather than conventional group level designs) can provide translationally informative answers.\n",

      "ABSTRACT A perspective on pre-eclampsia and neurodevelopmental outcomes in the offspring: Does maternal inflammation play a role?Pre-eclampsia is a leading cause of maternal death and maternal and perinatal morbidity. Whilst the clinical manifestations of pre-eclampsia often occur in late pregnancy, the molecular events leading into the onset of this disease are thought to originate in early pregnancy and result in insufficient placentation. Although the causative molecular basis of pre-eclampsia remains poorly understood, maternal inflammation is recognised as a core clinical feature. While the adverse effects of pre-eclampsia on maternal and fetal health in pregnancy is well-recognised, the long-term impact of pre-eclampsia exposure on the risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in exposed offspring is a topic of on-going debate. In particular, a recent systematic review has reported an association between exposure to pre-eclampsia and increased risk of ASD, however the molecular basis of this association is unknown. Here we review recent evidence for; 1) maternal inflammation in pre-eclampsia; 2) epidemiological evidence for alterations in neurodevelopmental outcomes in offspring exposed to pre-eclampsia; 3) long-term changes in the brains of offspring exposed to pre-eclampsia; and 4) how maternal inflammation may lead to altered neurodevelopmental outcomes in pre-eclampsia exposed offspring. Finally, we discuss the implications of this for the development of future studies in this field.\n",

We present a CRISPR gene editing strategy to insert a protein tag and premature termination sites creating an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) knockout resource for functional studies of ten ASD-relevant genes (AFF2/FMR2, ANOS1, ASTN2, ATRX, CACNA1C, CHD8, DLGAP2, KCNQ2, SCN2A, TENM1). Neurogenin 2 (NGN2)-directed induction of iPSCs allowed production of excitatory neurons, and mutant proteins were not detectable. RNA sequencing revealed convergence of several neuronal networks. Using both patch-clamp and multi-electrode array approaches, the electrophysiological deficits measured were distinct for different mutations. However, they culminated in a consistent reduction in synaptic activity, including reduced spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current frequencies in AFF2/FMR2-, ASTN2-, ATRX-, KCNQ2-, and SCN2A-null neurons. Despite ASD susceptibility genes belonging to different gene ontologies, isogenic stem cell resources can reveal common functional phenotypes, such as reduced functional connectivity.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Facial Expression Production in Autism: A Meta-Analysis.This meta-analysis summarized studies that examined group differences on the production of facial expressions in participants with ASD compared to typically developing or nonautistic clinical comparison groups. The overall summary effect from 67 effect sizes representing the average ASD-comparison group differences in facial expressions was -0.481, indicating a moderate effect size. We conducted subgroup analyses to group effect sizes according to separate facial expression abilities identified in the literature. These analyses revealed that participants with ASD display facial expressions less frequently and for less amount of time, and they are less likely to share facial expressions with others or automatically mimic the expressions of real faces or face stimuli. Their facial expressions are also judged to be lower in quality and are expressed less accurately. However, participants with ASD do not express emotions less intensely, nor is their reaction time of expression onset slower in response to odors, startling sensations, or in response to face stimuli in mimicry studies. ASD-comparison group differences were moderated by matching procedures, age, and intellectual functioning of the ASD participants suggesting that persons with higher IQ and larger number of accumulated life experiences are better able to produce facial expressions that are more consistent with \"neurotypical\" norms. Group differences were also stronger for \"covertly elicited\" than \"explicitly elicited\" facial expressions suggesting individuals with ASD may naturally produce facial expressions differently from other populations, but are less impaired in expressing emotions typically when prompted to do so in a laboratory setting.

      "ABSTRACT Social behavior, neuroimmune markers and glutamic acid decarboxylase levels in a rat model of valproic acid-induced autism.Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social communication and social interactions, and repetitive behaviors. The etiology of autism remains unknown and its molecular basis is not yet well understood. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were administered 600 mg/kg of valproic acid (VPA) by intraperitoneal injection on day 12.5 of gestation. Both 11- to 13-week-old male and female rat models of VPA-induced autism showed impaired sociability and impaired preference for social novelty as compared to the corresponding control SD rats. Significantly reduced mRNA expressions of social behavior-related genes, such as those encoding the serotonin receptor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neuroligin3, and significantly increased expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1 β and tumor necrosis factor-α, were noted in the hippocampi of both male and female rats exposed to VPA in utero. The hippocampal expression level of gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 67 protein was reduced in both male and female VPA-exposed rats as compared to the corresponding control animals. Our results indicate that developmental exposure to VPA affects the social behavior in rats by modulating the expression levels of social behavior-related genes and inflammatory mediators accompanied with changes in GABA enzyme in the hippocampus.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Gastrointestinal and Psychiatric Symptoms Among Children and Adolescents With Autism Spectrum Disorder.Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at heightened risk of psychiatric comorbidities across the lifespan, including elevated rates of internalizing, externalizing, and self-injurious behaviors. Identification of medical comorbidities that contribute to these concerns may elucidate mechanisms through which psychiatric concerns arise, as well as offer additional avenues for intervention. Gastrointestinal (GI) conditions are of particular interest, as they are prevalent among those with ASD, may share genetic or neurobiological etiologies with the core features of ASD, and are linked with psychiatric difficulties in the general population. In this paper, we draw on data from nearly 2,800 children and adolescents with ASD within the Simons Simplex Collection to characterize the unique contributions of (1) autism symptoms, (2) psychosocial factors (child's age, sex, verbal and nonverbal IQ, adaptive behavior, race, and household income), and (3) GI concerns with respect to multiple psychiatric outcomes. Multiple regression models revealed unique contributions of ASD symptoms and multiple psychosocial factors such as verbal IQ, adaptive behavior, and family income to internalizing, externalizing, and self-injurious behavior. In general, higher levels of psychiatric symptoms were associated with more ASD symptoms, higher verbal IQ, lower adaptive behavior skills, and lower family income. Furthermore, levels of GI symptoms accounted for unique variance in psychiatric outcomes over and above these other factors, linking increased GI problems with increased psychiatric symptoms in children with ASD. Taken together, results indicate that the presence and quantity of GI symptoms should be considered when evaluating psychiatric and behavioral concerns among children with ASD, and that treatment of GI conditions may be an important component in alleviating a broad array of mental health concerns in this group.\n",

Recall prompts elicited more detailed and more accurate responses from children than recognition prompts. Autistic children recalled fewer correct narrative details than TD peers when questioned using open invitations, cued invitations, and directive questions. Nonetheless, they were as accurate as TD peers when responding to all types of prompts. The informativeness and accuracy of children's reports remained unchanged over time.

Twenty-two autistic children and 25 typical children completed an ambiguous scenarios interview and questionnaire-based measures of anxiety. A subsample of mothers completed parent-report and adult relevant versions of the interview and anxiety questionnaires. Autistic children self-reported similar interpretations of ambiguous scenarios, and similar levels of anxiety, to their typical peers. In contrast, mothers of autistic children reported greater levels of anxiety, and more negative interpretations of ambiguous scenarios in both their children and themselves, relative to mothers of typical children.

      "ABSTRACT Syllogistic reasoning reveals reduced bias in people with higher autistic-like traits from the general population.Recent theories of autism have emphasised the cognitive strengths and weaknesses in those with autism, which are also seen to some degree in non-clinical samples with higher autistic-like traits. The dual process theory of autism proposes that people with autism and non-clinical people with a higher degree of autistic-like traits have a propensity to show reduced intuitive processing (automatic and typically faster) alongside enhanced propensity towards deliberative processing (dependent on general cognitive ability and typically slower). This study aimed to further test the dual process theory of autism by investigating syllogistic reasoning (whether a conclusion can be logically deduced from two propositions) in addition to the cognitive reflection test (correct responses to which reflect deliberative processing over-riding intuitive processing) with respect to the degree of autistic-like traits and general cognitive ability in a non-clinical sample of 189 adults. Results showed that higher levels of autistic-like traits were related to lower levels of intuitive processing and higher levels of deliberative processing, which was found across both the syllogistic reasoning and cognitive reflection test measures - over and above the effect of general cognitive ability. The findings are consistent with the dual process theory of autism, and implications for autism are discussed.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Do you know what I'm thinking? Temporal and spatial brain activity during a theory-of-mind task in children with autism.The social impairments observed in children with autism spectrum disorder are thought to arise in part from deficits in theory of mind, the ability to understand other people's thoughts and feelings. To determine the temporal-spatial dynamics of brain activity underlying these atypical theory-of-mind processes, we used magnetoencephalography to characterize the sequence of functional brain patterns (i.e. when and where) related to theory-of-mind reasoning in 19 high-functioning children with autism compared to 22 age- and sex-matched typically-developing children aged 8-12 during a false-belief (theory-of-mind) task. While task performance did not differ between the two groups, children with autism showed reduced activation in the left temporoparietal junction between 300-375 and 425-500 ms, as well as increased activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus from 325 to 375 ms compared to controls. The overlap in decreased temporoparietal junction activity and increased right inferior frontal gyrus activation from 325 to 375 ms suggests that in children with autism, the right inferior frontal gyrus may compensate for deficits in the temporoparietal junction, a neural theory-of-mind network hub. As the right inferior frontal gyrus is involved in inhibitory control, this finding suggests that children with autism rely on executive functions to bolster their false-belief understanding.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Neural Correlates of Social Perception in Children with Autism: Local versus Global Preferences.The Weak Central Coherence account of autism spectrum disorders posits that individuals with ASD utilize a detail-oriented information processing bias. While this local bias is helpful in visual search tasks, ASD individuals falter in social cognition tasks where coherence is advantageous. The present study examined the neural correlates of Weak Central Coherence in ASD during visual and social processing. Fifteen ASD and sixteen typically developing children/adolescents completed a social/visual information processing task in an fMRI scanner. The stimuli consisted of human characters, composed of geometrical shapes, displaying different emotions. In the locally oriented Shape condition, participants indicated whether a given shape was present in a figure. In the Emotion condition, participants identified the emotion conveyed by the character in the figure at the global level. Whole-brain within- and between-group activation and seed-to-voxel functional connectivity analyses were conducted in SPM12 and the CONN toolbox. The ASD group was significantly faster in shape identification, but less accurate in emotion identification. The TD group showed significantly increased areas of activity over the ASD group in the Shape task in regions associated with executive control, such as the medial prefrontal cortex and middle frontal gyrus, suggesting increased interference from the global/social information. During the Emotion condition, the ASD group showed decreased connectivity between frontal and posterior regions and between body perception and motor networks, suggesting a possible difference in mirroring. The findings suggest that social cognitive factors, not visual processing biases, underlie the observed behavioral differences.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Childhood Executive Function Predicts Later Autistic Features and Adaptive Behavior in Young Autistic People: a 12-Year Prospective Study.Longitudinal studies of autistic people show that the behavioral features of autism generally endure into adulthood. Yet the prognostic indicators remain far from certain, especially for cognitively able individuals. Here, we test the predictive power of specific cognitive skills, namely theory of mind and executive function, measured in childhood, on young people's autistic features and adaptive behavior 12 years later. Twenty-eight young autistic people (2 female) were seen twice within the space of 12 years. At Time 1 (M = 5 years; 7 months, SD = 11 months), participants were assessed on components of executive function (planning, inhibition and cognitive flexibility) and theory of mind (false-belief understanding). At Time 2, 12 years later (M = 17 years 10 months, SD = 1 year; 2 months), we measured participants' autistic features and adaptive behavior. Only Time 1 executive function skills predicted significant variance in autistic adolescents' autistic features, over and above variance attributable to early age, intellectual ability and theory of mind skills. Furthermore, early EF skills, in addition to early verbal ability and nonverbal ability, predicted significant variance in young people's adaptive behavior at the 12-year follow-up. These long-term longitudinal findings clearly demonstrate that executive function measured in early childhood has prognostic significance in a sample of young autistic people approaching emerging adulthood and underscore their importance as a key target for early intervention and support.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Prenatal metformin exposure or organic cation transporter 3 knock-out curbs social interaction preference in male mice.Poorly managed gestational diabetes can lead to severe complications for mother and child including fetal overgrowth, neonatal hypoglycemia and increased autism risk. Use of metformin to control it is relatively new and promising. Yet safety concerns regarding gestational metformin use remain, as its long-term effects in offspring are unclear. In light of beneficial findings with metformin for adult mouse social behavior, we hypothesized gestational metformin treatment might also promote offspring sociability. To test this, metformin was administered to non-diabetic, lean C57BL/6 J female mice at mating, with treatment discontinued at birth or wean. Male offspring exposed to metformin through birth lost social interaction preference relative to controls by time in chambers, but not by sniffing measures. Further, prenatal metformin exposure appeared to enhance social novelty preference only in females. However due to unbalanced litters and lack of statistical power, firm establishment of any sex-dependency of metformin's effects on sociability was not possible. Since organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3) transports metformin and is dense in placenta, social preferences of OCT3 knock-out males were measured. Relative to wild-type, OCT3 knock-outs had reduced interaction preference. Our data indicate gestational metformin exposure under non-diabetic conditions, or lack of OCT3, can impair social behavior in male C57BL6/J mice. Since OCT3 transports serotonin and tryptophan, impaired placental OCT3 function is one common mechanism that could persistently impact central serotonin systems and social behavior. Yet no gross alterations in serotonergic function were evident by measure of serotonin transporter density in OCT3, or serotonin turnover in metformin-exposed offspring brains. Mechanisms underlying the behavioral outcomes, and if with gestational diabetes the same would occur, remain unclear. Metformin's impacts on placental transporters and serotonin metabolism or AMPK activity in fetal brain need further investigation to clarify benefits and risks to offspring sociability from use of metformin to treat gestational diabetes.\n",

It causes an \"old\" object that has been on view for some time to acquire the properties of a suddenly appearing new object. In each experiment, a square outline was displayed continuously on one side of fixation. The target (an asterisk) was presented either inside the square or on the opposite side of fixation. On half of the trials, a transient visual or auditory event preceded the target. In Experiment 1a ( N = 139), response times were faster when the target appeared inside the square, but only when it was preceded by a transient event, consistent with the network-reset theory of locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) phasic activation. Three further experiments confirmed the predictions of network-reset theory, including the absence of rejuvenation in participants with atypical LC-NE functioning (individuals with symptoms of autism spectrum disorder).

In contrast, the use of chemical procedures to isolate and purify specific compounds from plants that have been used to treat autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and its clinical features may contribute to improve the quality of life of many patients. Also, herbal pharmacological treatments could improve the core symptoms of autism with fewer side effects. This review will focus on the uses and actions of phytopharmaceuticals in the behavioral conditions of ASDs. A large number of natural compound-based plant drugs have been tested in murine models of autism and in clinical trials with remarkable success in reversing the core and associated behaviors with autism such as flavonoids, cannabinoids, curcuminoids, piperine, resveratrol, and bacosides. This plant-based drug alternative is safer given that many psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative pathologies do not often respond well to currently prescribed medications or have significant side effects. However, it is noteworthy to consider the need for large clinical trials to determine safety and efficacy. Many results are based on case reports or small size samples, and often the studies are open label.

      "ABSTRACT Rapid Eye Movements in Sleep Furnish a Unique Probe Into Consciousness.The neural correlates of rapid eye movements (REMs) in sleep are extraordinarily robust; including REM-locked multisensory-motor integration and accompanying activation in the retrosplenial cortex, the supplementary eye field and areas encompassing cholinergic basal nucleus (Hong et al., 2009). The phenomenology of REMs speaks to the notion that perceptual experience in both sleep and wakefulness is a constructive process - in which we generate predictions of sensory inputs and then test those predictions through actively sampling the sensorium with eye movements. On this view, REMs during sleep may index an internalized active sampling or 'scanning' of self-generated visual constructs that are released from the constraints of visual input. If this view is correct, it renders REMs an ideal probe to study consciousness as \"an exclusively internal affair\" (Metzinger, 2009). In other words, REMs offer a probe of active inference - in the sense of predictive coding - when the brain is isolated from the sensorium in virtue of the natural blockade of sensory afferents during REM sleep. Crucially, REMs are temporally precise events that enable powerful inferences based on time series analyses. As a natural, task-free probe, (REMs) could be used in non-compliant subjects, including infants and animals. In short, REMs constitute a promising probe to study the ontogenetic and phylogenetic development of consciousness and perhaps the psychopathology of schizophrenia and autism, which have been considered in terms of aberrant predictive coding.\n",

Epidemiologic studies implicate maternal infections in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders, most commonly autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. In animal models, MIA causes neurochemical and anatomic changes in the brain that correspond to those found in humans with the disorders. As our understanding of the interactions between environment, genetics, and immune system grows, the role of alternative, noninfectious risk factors, such as prenatal stress, obesity, and the gut microbiome also becomes clearer.

This study was conducted with the aim of ascertaining the parent's knowledge and awareness of autism. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among parents residing in Karachi, Pakistan. We excluded any individuals belonging to the medical profession, those who have autistic children, and those who couldn't completely comprehend English and Urdu. A sample size of 339 parents was selected. A validated and pre-tested questionnaire was administered among the study participants to record demographic information, knowledge, and perceptions regarding autism and its signs and symptoms. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version 23.0, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, US). A knowledge score was calculated for opinions about autism and its sign and symptoms individually to reflect a participant's overall knowledge regarding autism. Results From our study population, 75% of our population had heard of autism, with those who knew of someone with the disorder displaying greater awareness. However, our participants displayed poor knowledge scores, with a mean score of 5.59 in the section concerning correct opinions on autism and that of 6.84 in the section testing knowledge of signs and symptoms. Despite this, 95.6% of the participants were willing to get their children treated, in the event of them being diagnosed with autism. Conclusion Unfortunately, our population displayed a lack of awareness and knowledge regarding autism. To fill this gap, awareness programs should be conducted to promote parent's knowledge regarding autism, so as to allow for early diagnoses and an appropriate treatment plan/therapy. On a positive note, most were willing to get their children tested and treated in case of a diagnosis. However, only a small number of participants knew of autism centers in Karachi. General practitioners are needed to play a key role in counseling parents about autism.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Brief Report: Regional Variations in Characteristics of ASD Hospitalizations in the U.S.Regional differences in ASD inpatient care remain understudied. We used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample to examine contributory causes and potential determinants associated with regional variations in ASD hospitalizations. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses to identify differences in ASD hospitalizations across four U.S. Census Bureau-defined regions. Our results revealed considerable variations in ASD hospitalizations across U.S. regions. Compared with patients in the Northeast, those in the Midwest, South, and West were less likely to be hospitalized for ASD. Significant differences were observed among regions with regard to the effect of health insurance type, hospital length of stay, hospital bed size, hospital location and teaching status on ASD hospitalizations. The region-specific analysis provides direction for further investigation.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Ultrasonic vocalizations as a tool in studying emotional states in rodent models of social behavior and brain disease.Rodents emit ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) to communicate the presence of positive or negative emotional states and to coordinate social interactions. On this basis, USVs are increasingly being used as a behavioral readout in rodent studies of affect, motivation and social behavior. Notably, several investigations have demonstrated that rodents emit USVs when tested in experimental paradigms that are used in preclinical studies of psychiatric and neurological diseases. Moreover, it has been shown that calling behavior may be influenced by genetic and/or environmental factors (i.e., stress), early rearing conditions that have been implicated in brain disease, as well as psychoactive drugs. Hence, measuring USV emissions has emerged as a useful tool in studying the mechanisms that underlie the emotional disturbances featuring certain brain diseases, as well as in the development of suited pharmacological therapies. This review provides an overview of the behavioral significance of USV emissions and describes the contexts that promote calling behavior in rats and mice. Moreover, the review summarizes the current evidence concerning the use of USVs as a marker of affect in rat and mouse models of sociability, psychiatric diseases and neurological diseases, and discusses the strengths and current limitations of using USVs as a behavioral readout in rodent studies of emotional behavior.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Parents' future visions for their autistic transition-age youth: Hopes and expectations.Researchers have documented that young adults with autism spectrum disorder have poor outcomes in employment, post-secondary education, social participation, independent living, and community participation. There is a need to further explore contributing factors to such outcomes to better support successful transitions to adulthood. Parents play a critical role in transition planning, and parental expectations appear to impact young adult outcomes for autistic individuals. The aim of this study was to explore how parents express their future visions (i.e. hopes and expectations) for their autistic transition-age youth. Data were collected through focus groups and individual interviews with 18 parents. Parents' hopes and expectations focused on eight primary domains. In addition, parents often qualified or tempered their stated hope with expressions of fears, uncertainty, realistic expectations, and the perceived lack of guidance. We discuss our conceptualization of the relations among these themes and implications for service providers and research.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Overview of genetic models of autism spectrum disorders.Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of neurodevelopment disorders that are characterized by heterogenous cognitive deficits and genetic factors. As more ASD risk genes are identified, genetic animal models have been developed to parse out the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of ASD. In this review, we discuss a subset of genetic models of ASD, focusing on those that have been widely studied and strongly linked to ASD. We focus our discussion of these models in the context of the theories and potential mechanisms of ASD, including disruptions in cell growth and proliferation, spine dynamics, synaptic transmission, excitation/inhibition balance, intracellular signaling, neuroinflammation, and behavior. In addition to ASD pathophysiology, we examine the limitations and challenges that genetic models pose for the study of ASD biology. We end with a review of innovative techniques and concepts of ASD pathology that can be further applied to and studied using genetic ASD models.\n",

      "ABSTRACT From bedside to bench and back: Translating ASD models.Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) represent a heterogeneous group of disorders defined by deficits in social interaction/communication and restricted interests, behaviors, or activities. Models of ASD, developed based on clinical data and observations, are used in basic science, the \"bench,\" to better understand the pathophysiology of ASD and provide therapeutic options for patients in the clinic, the \"bedside.\" Translational medicine creates a bridge between the bench and bedside that allows for clinical and basic science discoveries to challenge one another to improve the opportunities to bring novel therapies to patients. From the clinical side, biomarker work is expanding our understanding of possible mechanisms of ASD through measures of behavior, genetics, imaging modalities, and serum markers. These biomarkers could help to subclassify patients with ASD in order to better target treatments to a more homogeneous groups of patients most likely to respond to a candidate therapy. In turn, basic science has been responding to developments in clinical evaluation by improving bench models to mechanistically and phenotypically recapitulate the ASD phenotypes observed in clinic. While genetic models are identifying novel therapeutics targets at the bench, the clinical efforts are making progress by defining better outcome measures that are most representative of meaningful patient responses. In this review, we discuss some of these challenges in translational research in ASD and strategies for the bench and bedside to bridge the gap to achieve better benefits to patients.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Early Diagnosis of Autism Disease by Multi-channel CNNs.Currently there are still no early biomarkers to detect infants with risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which is mainly diagnosed based on behavior observations at three or four years old. Since intervention efforts may miss a critical developmental window after 2 years old, it is significant to identify imaging-based biomarkers for early diagnosis of ASD. Although some methods using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for brain disease prediction have been proposed in the last decade, few of them were developed for predicting ASD in early age. Inspired by deep multi-instance learning, in this paper, we propose a patch-level data-expanding strategy for multi-channel convolutional neural networks to automatically identify infants with risk of ASD in early age. Experiments were conducted on the National Database for Autism Research (NDAR), with results showing that our proposed method can significantly improve the performance of early diagnosis of ASD.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Auditory Midbrain Hypoplasia and Dysmorphology after Prenatal Valproic Acid Exposure.Prenatal exposure to the antiepileptic valproic acid (VPA) is associated with an increased risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in humans and is used as an animal model of ASD. The majority of individuals with ASD exhibit adverse reactions to sensory stimuli and auditory dysfunction. Previous studies of animals exposed to VPA reveal abnormal neuronal responses to sound and mapping of sound frequency in the cerebral cortex and hyperactivation, hypoplasia and abnormal neuronal morphology in the cochlear nuclei (CN) and superior olivary complex (SOC). Herein, we examine the neuronal populations in the lateral lemniscus and inferior colliculus in animals exposed in utero to VPA. We used a combination of morphometric techniques, histochemistry and immunofluorescence to examine the nuclei of the lateral lemniscus (NLL) and the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (CNIC). We found that the VPA exposure resulted in larger neurons in the CNIC and the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (DNLL). However, we found that there were significantly fewer neurons throughout all nuclei examined in the auditory brainstem of VPA-exposed animals. Additionally, we found significantly fewer calbindin-immunopositive neurons in the DNLL. VPA exposure had no impact on the proportions of perineuronal nets in the NLL or CNIC. Finally, consistent with our observations in the CN and SOC, VPA exposure resulted in fewer dopaminergic terminals in the CNIC. Together, these results indicate that in utero VPA exposure significantly impacts structure and function of nearly the entire central auditory pathway.\n",

Using a multiple baseline across participants design, we evaluated a training package consisting of multiple exemplar training, reinforcement, and error correction. The treatment package was implemented in the natural environment and was effective for teaching participants to tact what others sensed. Generalization across untrained stimuli and people was observed from baseline to posttraining for all participants.

However, children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), with whom many behavior analysts currently practice, are underrepresented in this body of literature. We conducted a replication of prior research with 26 children with ASD. Results indicated that edible items were more likely than leisure items to rank highly in our preference assessments, in concurrence with prior research. However, leisure items were also selected more often overall than in prior research, and significant individual variation was observed. These results suggest that preference assessments containing both edible and leisure stimuli can yield useful information for behavior analysts providing services to children with ASD, and the degree of preference for edible items noted in prior work may not be reflected in this contemporary population.\n",

      "ABSTRACT REDUCED CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN MENTALIZING AND MIRROR SYSTEMS IN AUTISM SPECTRUM CONDITION.The mentalizing system and mirror system are thought to play important roles in inferring the internal mental states of others - a process known as mentalizing. Autism spectrum condition (ASC) is associated with difficulties in mentalizing. The aim of this study was to determine whether the behavioural difficulties in mentalizing associated with ASC can be explained by changes in functional connectivity between the mentalizing and mirror system. We recruited 40 adult participants (20 with ASC and 20 typically-developing). Brain activity was monitored using functional magnetic resonance imaging while participants watched videos in which actors performed hand actions. The videos were shown in separate mentalizing and non-mentalizing blocks. During mentalizing blocks, participants were asked to indicate whether hand actions were clumsy or spiteful (i.e. to judge the intent of the action). During non-mentalizing blocks, participants indicated whether the actions were successful or unsuccessful (i.e. to judge the outcome of the action). Higher activity during the mentalizing blocks compared to non-mentalizing blocks was found in regions associated with the mentalizing system: the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), as well as in regions typically associated with the mirror system: the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the inferior parietal lobe (IPL). Next, functional connectivity between regions was evaluated as a function of task. During mentalizing blocks, there was increased functional connectivity between the dmPFC and the mirror system in typically developing participants. In contrast, there was no increase in functional connectivity between these regions in ASC participants. Connectivity between the dmPFC and IFG was negatively correlated with autistic traits. The reduced connectivity in ASC participants was consistent with behavioural performance on the mentalizing task, which was also negatively correlated with the level of autistic traits. Together, these data emphasise the importance of functional connectivity between the mentalizing and mirror systems when inferring social intentions and show that reduced connectivity between these systems may explain some of the behavioural difficulties experienced by adults with ASC.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Foot massage evokes oxytocin release and activation of orbitofrontal cortex and superior temporal sulcus.Massage may be an important method for increasing endogenous oxytocin concentrations and of potential therapeutic benefit in disorders with social dysfunction such as autism where basal oxytocin levels are typically reduced. Here we investigated oxytocin release and associated neural responses using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during hand- or machine-administered massage. 40 adult male subjects received 10 min of light foot massage either by hand or machine in a counterbalanced order and then rated pleasure, intensity, arousal and how much they would pay for the massage. Blood samples were taken before and after each massage condition to determine plasma oxytocin concentrations. Neural responses from medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortex, superior temporal sulcus and somatosensory cortex were measured (fNIRS oxy-Hb) together with skin conductance responses (SCR), ratings of the massage experience, autistic traits and sensitivity to social touch. Results showed subjects gave higher ratings of pleasure, but not intensity or arousal, after hand- compared with machine-administered massage and there were no differential effects on SCR. Subjects were also willing to pay more for the hand massage. Plasma oxytocin increased after both massage by hand or machine, but more potently after massage by hand. Both basal oxytocin concentrations and increases evoked by hand-, but not machine-administered massage, were negatively associated with trait autism and attitudes towards social touch, but massage by hand-evoked changes were significant in higher as well as lower trait individuals. Increased neural responses to hand vs. machine-administered massage were found in posterior superior temporal sulcus and medial/lateral orbitofrontal cortex but not somatosensory cortex. Orbitofrontal cortex and superior temporal cortex activation during hand massage was associated with the amount of money subjects were willing to pay and between orbitofrontal cortex activation and autism scores. Thus, hand-administered massage can potently increase oxytocin release and activity in brain regions involved in social cognition and reward but not sensory aspects of affective touch. Massage by hand induced changes in both oxytocin concentrations and neural circuits involved in processing social affective trust may have therapeutic potential in the context of autism.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Using Pupillometry to Assess the Atypical Pupillary Light Reflex and LC-NE System in ASD.With recent advances in technology, there has been growing interest in use of eye-tracking and pupillometry to assess the visual pathway in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Within emerging literature, an atypical pupillary light reflex (PLR) has been documented, holding potential for use as a clinical screening biomarker for ASD. This review outlines dominant theories of neuropathology associated with ASD and integrates underlying neuroscience associated with the atypical PLR through a reciprocal model of brainstem involvement and cortical underconnectivity. This review draws from animal models of ASD demonstrating disruption of cranial motor nuclei and brain imaging studies examining arousal and the influence of the locus coeruleus norepinephrine (LC-NE) system on the pupillary response. Pupillometry methods are explained in relation to existing data examining the PLR in ASD and pupillary parameters of constriction latency and tonic pupil diameter as key parameters for investigation. This focused review provides preliminary data toward future work developing pupillometry metrics and offers direction for studies aimed at rigorous study replication using pupillometry with the ASD population. Experimental conditions and testing protocol for capturing pupil parameters with this clinical population are discussed to promote clinical research and translational application.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Identifying and treating autism spectrum disorders in perinatal care].Severe forms of autism may be spotted by families in the first year of life, but are still rarely treated before the age of 3. Screening and early treatment are recommended to improve the children's functional prognosis. However, there is still little knowledge among perinatal and early childhood professionals of the symptomatology of autistic disorders. Several points are sensitive: during the first year the symptoms of children at risk are non-specific apart from a lack of desire to form relationships; and the early treatment probably modifies the clinical picture of young patients. Screening tools are rare but are starting to be developed.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Social difficulties in youth with autism with and without anxiety and ADHD symptoms.Social difficulties inherent to autism spectrum disorder are often linked with co-occurring symptoms of anxiety and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The present study sought to examine the relation between such co-occurring symptoms and social challenges. Parents of adolescents with autism (N = 113) reported upon social challenges via the social responsiveness scale (SRS) and anxiety and ADHD symptomatology via the Child Behavior Checklist. Results revealed differences in SRS scores across co-occurring symptom subgroups (Anxiety, ADHD, Both, Neither)-namely, adolescents with autism and anxiety as well as those with autism, anxiety, and ADHD showed greater scores on the SRS than the other groups. Implications for research and clinical practice are discussed and recommendations are offered. Autism Research 2018, 11: 1679-1689. © 2018 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: Anxiety and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms are related to greater social challenges for adolescents with autism spectrum disorder. The present study found that autism with anxiety and autism with anxiety and ADHD, was related to greater social difficulties than autism alone. Findings provide further support for the intertwined nature of anxiety and ADHD symptoms in autism. What this may mean for research and clinical practice is considered and recommendations are suggested.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Behavioral inhibition and activation as a modifier process in autism spectrum disorder: Examination of self-reported BIS/BAS and alpha EEG asymmetry.The Modifier Model of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) suggests that phenotypic variability within ASD is rooted in modifier processes, such as the behavioral inhibition system (BIS) and behavioral activation system (BAS). Among a sample of 53 adolescents with ASD, this study examined associations between (a) self-reported BIS/BAS and frontal and parietal alpha electroencephalogram asymmetry and whether these indices related to (b) ASD severity (via the Autism Quotient), and/or (c) co-occurring anxiety and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (via Youth Self Report and Child Behavior Checklist). Findings showed that alpha asymmetry was associated with self-reported BAS scores, such that greater BAS was related to greater right-frontal hemisphere activation and relatively greater left-parietal hemisphere activation. Additionally, associations emerged between ASD severity and self-reported BAS and alpha asymmetry, and between anxiety symptoms and self-reported BIS and alpha asymmetry. Furthermore, mediation analyses revealed that BAS mediated the association between asymmetry and autism severity. Therefore, alpha asymmetry and BIS/BAS activity may provide insight into how ASD presents in adolescence as well as who might be at greater risk for developing co-occurring psychopathologies. This study highlights the importance of considering motivational systems to elucidate individual differences among youth with ASD and working toward the longer term goal of better understanding differential responses to treatment. Autism Research 2018, 11: 1653-1666. © 2018 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: Differences in the likelihood to avoid (behavioral inhibition system; BIS) or approach (behavioral activation system; BAS) situations are thought to relate to patterns of brain activity (via electroencephalogram asymmetry asymmetry). This study revealed that these tendencies may influence the presentation of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and symptoms of anxiety in adolescents with ASD.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Endocrine Disruptors and Autism Spectrum Disorder in Pregnancy: A Review and Evaluation of the Quality of the Epidemiological Evidence.Exposure to environmental contaminants during pregnancy has been linked to adverse health outcomes later in life. Notable among these pollutants are the endocrine disruptors chemicals (EDCs), which are ubiquitously present in the environment and they have been measured and quantified in the fetus. In this systematic review, our objective was to summarize the epidemiological research on the potential association between prenatal exposure to EDCs and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) published from 2005 to 2016. The Navigation Guide Systematic Review Methodology was applied. A total of 17 studies met the inclusion criteria for this review, including: five cohorts and 12 case-control. According to the definitions specified in the Navigation Guide, we rated the quality of evidence for a relationship between prenatal exposure to EDCs and ASD as \"moderate\". Although the studies generally showed a positive association between EDCs and ASD, after considering the strengths and limitations, we concluded that the overall strength of evidence supporting an association between prenatal exposure to EDCs and later ASD in humans remains \"limited\" and inconclusive. Further well-conducted prospective studies are warranted to clarify the role of EDCs on ASD development.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Immune Dysfunction and Autoimmunity as Pathological Mechanisms in Autism Spectrum Disorders.Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of heterogeneous neurological disorders that are highly variable and are clinically characterized by deficits in social interactions, communication, and stereotypical behaviors. Prevalence has risen from 1 in 10,000 in 1972 to 1 in 59 children in the United States in 2014. This rise in prevalence could be due in part to better diagnoses and awareness, however, these together cannot solely account for such a significant rise. While causative connections have not been proven in the majority of cases, many current studies focus on the combined effects of genetics and environment. Strikingly, a distinct picture of immune dysfunction has emerged and been supported by many independent studies over the past decade. Many players in the immune-ASD puzzle may be mechanistically contributing to pathogenesis of these disorders, including skewed cytokine responses, differences in total numbers and frequencies of immune cells and their subsets, neuroinflammation, and adaptive and innate immune dysfunction, as well as altered levels of immunoglobulin and the presence of autoantibodies which have been found in a substantial number of individuals with ASD. This review summarizes the latest research linking ASD, autoimmunity and immune dysfunction, and discusses evidence of a potential autoimmune component of ASD.\n",

The Pragmatic Rating Scale-School-Age (Landa unpublished) was scored for 49 HR siblings and 18 LR controls at 8-12 years. Social-communication and language measures were collected between 14 and 36 months. At 36-months, siblings were classified as ASD (HR-ASD, n = 15), broad autism phenotype (HR-BAP, n = 19), or typically developing (HR-TD, n = 15). Results revealed a pragmatic continuum with significantly better scores for HR-TD than HR-BAP or HR-ASD, and HR-BAP than HR-ASD. Per regression models including all participants, 14-month joint attention initiations predicted school-age pragmatic communication, as did 24-month social-communication and expressive language scores. Early joint attention, social-communication, and language abilities contribute to later pragmatic functioning.\n",

Extensive evidences demonstrated that the core neurobiological mechanism of autism spectrum disorder is aberrant neural connectivity, so the entropy of EEG can be applied to quantify this aberrant neural connectivity. In this study, we investigated four entropy methods to analyse the resting-state EEG of the autistic children and the typical development (TD) children. Through 43 children diagnosed with autism aged from 4 to 8 years old as compared to 43 normal children matched for age and gender, we found region-specifically and entropy-specifically which were more sensitive with the increase of age. In detail, for 4 years old group, there is significant difference in central by Renyi permutation entropy method; the significant differences are in frontal and central by sample entropy for 5 years old group; the significant difference is in frontal by fuzzy entropy for 6 years old group; the significant difference is in central by Renyi wavelet entropy for 7 years old group and the difference is in occipital by Renyi wavelet entropy for 8 years old group. The results might guide us to make an accurate distinction between ASD and TD children.\n",

Although recent studies have demonstrated the health benefits of nature for typically developing children and children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, it is unclear whether these benefits extend to children with ASD. In this study, we investigated whether benefits associated with exposure to nature could be observed by parents of children diagnosed with ASD. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 22 parents and caregivers of children on the spectrum from two cities in China. Results showed that exposure to nature provided motor-sensory, emotional and social benefits to children with ASD, although some of the identified benefits also come with concerns. Participants identified a wide range of barriers that make exposing their children to nature difficult. Among them, inappropriate behaviors, safety concerns, phobias and issues with the public realm emerged as critical hurdles. These findings suggest that practitioners should consider nature exposure as an intervention strategy, and planners and designers should create places that better accommodate the needs of children with ASD.\n",

We collected video data on three tasks involving retrieval of a small toy by opening (a) an opaque box, (b) a transparent box, and (c) two nested boxes. Dependent variables included hand bias, time to completion, bilateral hand use, problem-solving strategies used, and tester assistance required. There were no group differences in terms of hand biases. Compared to TD infants, AR infants had lower bilateral hand use, poor problem solving skills, and required greater assistance. Both groups demonstrated age-related improvements in motor and cognitive skills. Means-end exploration provides a window into the bilateral coordination and motor planning/problem-solving abilities of young infants at risk for autism.

      "ABSTRACT Neuroimmune and Inflammatory Signals in Complex Disorders of the Central Nervous System.An extensive microglial-astrocyte-monocyte-neuronal cross talk seems to be crucial for normal brain function, development, and recovery. However, under certain conditions neuroinflammatory interactions between brain cells and neuroimmune cells influence disease outcome and brain pathology. Microglial cells express a range of functional states with dynamically pleomorphic profiles from a surveilling status of synaptic transmission to an active player in major events of development such as synaptic elimination, regeneration, and repair. Also, inflammation mediates a series of neurotoxic roles in neuropsychiatric conditions and neurodegenerative diseases. The present review discusses data on the involvement of neuroinflammatory conditions that alter neuroimmune interactions in four different pathologies. In the first section of this review, we discuss the ability of the early developing brain to respond to a focal lesion with a rapid compensatory plasticity of intact axons and the role of microglial activation and proinflammatory cytokines in brain repair. In the second section, we present data of neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative disorders and discuss the role of reactive astrocytes in motor neuron toxicity and the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In the third section, we discuss major depressive disorders as the consequence of dysfunctional interactions between neural and immune signals that result in increased peripheral immune responses and increase proinflammatory cytokines. In the last section, we discuss autism spectrum disorders and altered brain circuitries that emerge from abnormal long-term responses of innate inflammatory cytokines and microglial phenotypic dysfunctions.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Solving for X: Evidence for sex-specific autism biomarkers across multiple transcriptomic studies.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a markedly heterogeneous condition with a varied phenotypic presentation. Its high concordance among siblings, as well as its clear association with specific genetic disorders, both point to a strong genetic etiology. However, the molecular basis of ASD is still poorly understood, although recent studies point to the existence of sex-specific ASD pathophysiologies and biomarkers. Despite this, little is known about how exactly sex influences the gene expression signatures of ASD probands. In an effort to identify sex-dependent biomarkers and characterize their function, we present an analysis of a single paired-end postmortem brain RNA-Seq data set and a meta-analysis of six blood-based microarray data sets. Here, we identify several genes with sex-dependent dysregulation, and many more with sex-independent dysregulation. Moreover, through pathway analysis, we find that these sex-independent biomarkers have substantially different biological roles than the sex-dependent biomarkers, and that some of these pathways are ubiquitously dysregulated in both postmortem brain and blood. We conclude by synthesizing the discovered biomarker profiles with the extant literature, by highlighting the advantage of studying sex-specific dysregulation directly, and by making a call for new transcriptomic data that comprise large female cohorts.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Mechanisms Underlying Microbial-Mediated Changes in Social Behavior in Mouse Models of Autism Spectrum Disorder.Currently, there are no medications that effectively treat the core symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We recently found that the bacterial species Lactobacillus (L.) reuteri reverses social deficits in maternal high-fat-diet offspring. However, whether the effect of L. reuteri on social behavior is generalizable to other ASD models and its mechanism(s) of action remains unknown. Here, we found that treatment with L. reuteri selectively rescues social deficits in genetic, environmental, and idiopathic ASD models. Interestingly, the effects of L. reuteri on social behavior are not mediated by restoring the composition of the host's gut microbiome, which is altered in all of these ASD models. Instead, L. reuteri acts in a vagus nerve-dependent manner and rescues social interaction-induced synaptic plasticity in the ventral tegmental area of ASD mice, but not in oxytocin receptor-deficient mice. Collectively, treatment with L. reuteri emerges as promising non-invasive microbial-based avenue to combat ASD-related social dysfunction.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Molecular Pathology and Pharmacological Treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorder-Like Phenotypes Using Rodent Models.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder with a high prevalence rate. The core symptoms of ASD patients are impaired social communication and repetitive behavior. Genetic and environmental factors contribute to pathophysiology of ASD. Regarding environmental risk factors, it is known that valproic acid (VPA) exposure during pregnancy increases the chance of ASD among offspring. Over a decade of animal model studies have shown that maternal treatment with VPA in rodents recapitulates ASD-like pathophysiology at a molecular, cellular and behavioral level. Here, we review the prevailing theories of ASD pathogenesis, including excitatory/inhibitory imbalance, neurotransmitter dysfunction, dysfunction of mTOR and endocannabinoid signaling pathways, neuroinflammation and epigenetic alterations that have been associated with ASD. We also describe the evidence linking neuropathological changes to ASD-like behavioral abnormalities in maternal VPA-treated rodents. In addition to obtaining an understanding of the neuropathological mechanisms, the VPA-induced ASD-like animal models also serve as a good platform for testing pharmacological reagents that might be use treating ASD. We therefore have summarized the various pharmacological studies that have targeted the classical neurotransmitter systems, the endocannabinoids, the Wnt signal pathway and neuroinflammation. These approaches have been shown to often be able to ameliorate the ASD-like phenotypes induced by maternal VPA treatments.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Differential T Cell Levels of Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-II in Children With Autism.Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by impairments in verbal and non-verbal communication, in social interactions, and often accompanied by stereotypical interests and behaviors. A role for immune dysfunction has long been implicated in ASD pathophysiology, behavioral severity, and co-morbidities. The pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) has been associated with ASD in some studies but little is known about its receptors. There are two receptors for TNFα, with TNFRI relaying many of the signals from TNFα, especially those that are rapid, whilst TNFRII relays later more long-term effects of TNFα. Proteolytic cleavage can lead to the soluble versions of these receptors which can neutralize the effects of TNFα. Here, we determined levels of TNFα and its receptors in 36 children with a confirmed diagnosis of ASD and 27 confirmed typically developing (TD) controls, 2-5 years-of-age. Children with ASD had higher levels of TNFRII on T cells compared to controls following cell stimulation. Levels of sTNFRII were decreased in cell supernatants following stimulation in ASD. Overall these data corroborate the role of inflammatory events in ASD and align with previous studies that have shown differential changes in cellular adaptive immunity in children with ASD. Future longitudinal analyzes of cellular immune function and downstream signaling from immune receptors will help further delineate the role of inflammation in ASD.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Effects of modeling rote versus varied responses on response variability and skill acquisition during discrete-trial instruction.Despite its advantages, discrete-trial instruction (DTI) has been criticized for producing rote responding. Although there is little research supporting this claim, if true, this may be problematic given the propensity of children with autism to engage in restricted and repetitive behavior. One feature that is common in DTI that may contribute to rote responding is the prompting and reinforcement of one correct response per discriminative stimulus. To evaluate the potential negative effects of rote prompts on varied responding, we compared the effects of modeling rote versus varied target responses during the teaching of intraverbal categorization. We also evaluated the effects of these procedures on the efficiency of acquisition of any one correct response. For all four children, any increase in varied responding was fleeting, and for two participants, acquisition was slower in the variable-modeling condition. Reading speed and phonological awareness deficits among Arabic-speaking children with dyslexia.Although reading accuracy of isolated words and phonological awareness represent the main criteria of subtyping developmental dyslexia, there is increasing evidence that reduced reading speed also represents a defining characteristic. In the present study, reading speed and accuracy were measured in Arabic-speaking phonological and mixed dyslexic children matched with controls of the same age. Participants in third and fourth grades, aged from 9-10 to 9-8 years, were given single frequent and infrequent word and pseudo-word reading and phonological awareness tasks. Results showed that the group with dyslexia scored significantly lower than controls in accuracy and speed in reading tasks. Phonological and mixed dyslexic subgroups differed in infrequent and frequent word reading accuracy, the latter being worse. In contrast, the subgroups were comparable in pseudo-word identification and phonological awareness. Delayed phonological and recognition processes of infrequent and frequent words, respectively, were placed in the context of the dual route model of reading and the specific orthographic features of the Arabic language.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Rapid Automatized Naming in Children with Dyslexia: Is Inhibitory Control Involved?Rapid automatized naming (RAN) is widely seen as an important indicator of dyslexia. The nature of the cognitive processes involved in rapid naming is however still a topic of controversy. We hypothesized that in addition to the involvement of phonological processes and processing speed, RAN is a function of inhibition processes, in particular of interference control. A total 86 children with dyslexia and 31 normal readers were recruited. Our results revealed that in addition to phonological processing and processing speed, interference control predicts rapid naming in dyslexia, but in contrast to these other two cognitive processes, inhibition is not significantly associated with their reading and spelling skills. After variance in reading and spelling associated with processing speed, interference control and phonological processing was partialled out, naming speed was no longer consistently associated with the reading and spelling skills of children with dyslexia. Finally, dyslexic children differed from normal readers on naming speed, literacy skills, phonological processing and processing speed, but not on inhibition processes. Both theoretical and clinical interpretations of these results are discussed.\n",

Portuguese children with developmental dyslexia (DD; N=24; aged 10-12 years), chronological age (CA)-matched controls (N=24; aged 10-12 years) and reading level (RL)-matched controls (N=24; aged 7-9 years) were tested on measures of phonological processing (phonological awareness, naming speed and verbal short-term memory) and reading. The results indicated that the children with DD performed significantly poorer in all measures compared with the CA and RL. Phonological awareness and naming speed showed a high accuracy (receiver operating characteristics curve analysis) for discriminating the children with DD from the CA and RL, whereas the presence of abnormally low scores in phonological awareness and naming speed was more frequent in the DD group than in the controls and the normative population. Hierarchical linear regression analyses revealed that phonological awareness was the most important predictor of all reading accuracy measures, whereas naming speed was particularly related to text reading fluency.\n",

Finally, models of dyslexic and typically developing children's working memory, inhibition and word recognition were similar in that working memory and cognitive inhibition significantly contributed to word recognition for both dyslexic and typically developing children. Moreover, the contribution of the combination of working memory and inhibition was greater than the contribution of only inhibition; both of typically developing and dyslexic children's working memory showed more contributions than inhibition.\n",

Additionally, the account also illustrates the ways in which teachers' personal experiences of dyslexia can shape professional identities in very positive ways.

      "ABSTRACT How reliable are gray matter disruptions in specific reading disability across multiple countries and languages? Insights from a large-scale voxel-based morphometry study.The neural basis of specific reading disability (SRD) remains only partly understood. A dozen studies have used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to investigate gray matter volume (GMV) differences between SRD and control children, however, recent meta-analyses suggest that few regions are consistent across studies. We used data collected across three countries (France, Poland, and Germany) with the aim of both increasing sample size (236 SRD and controls) to obtain a clearer picture of group differences, and of further assessing the consistency of the findings across languages. VBM analysis reveals a significant group difference in a single cluster in the left thalamus. Furthermore, we observe correlations between reading accuracy and GMV in the left supramarginal gyrus and in the left cerebellum, in controls only. Most strikingly, we fail to replicate all the group differences in GMV reported in previous studies, despite the superior statistical power. The main limitation of this study is the heterogeneity of the sample drawn from different countries (i.e., speaking languages with varying orthographic transparencies) and selected based on different assessment batteries. Nevertheless, analyses within each country support the conclusions of the cross-linguistic analysis. Explanations for the discrepancy between the present and previous studies may include: (1) the limited suitability of VBM to reveal the subtle brain disruptions underlying SRD; (2) insufficient correction for multiple statistical tests and flexibility in data analysis, and (3) publication bias in favor of positive results. Thus the study echoes widespread concerns about the risk of false-positive results inherent to small-scale VBM studies.\n",

In fact, girls with elevated blood lead levels (BLLs - 10 μg/dL) performed as well as girls without elevated BLLs on behavioral measures of cognition. This was shown by testing executive function and reading readiness skills of 40 young children (aged three to six years; 23 with elevated blood lead levels, 17 without) residing within a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-designated lead Superfund site. The results also indicate that elevated BLLs are related to a more pronounced negative impact on executive function than on reading readiness. These findings support recent research on adults indicating that lead exposure is related to atrophy within the prefrontal cortex and other work suggesting that estrogen and estradiol may act as neuroprotectants against the negative impact of neurotoxins.\n",

Group analysis demonstrated an MA deficit in dyslexics; as well, MA was found to significantly predict a greater proportion of word reading and spelling within the dyslexic group compared with the controls. Compensated dyslexics were also found to perform significantly better on the morphological task than noncompensated dyslexics. Additionally, no statistical difference was observed in MA between the normal reading controls and the compensated group (independent of PA and vocabulary). Results suggest that intact and strong MA skills contribute to the achieved compensation of this group of adults with dyslexia.

Six biographical questions, 20 general language statements and 56 specific language statements were based on dyslexia as a multi-dimensional deficit. Dyslexia and non-dyslexia were assessed with two criteria: identification with test results (Sample 1) and classification using biographical information (both samples). Using discriminant analyses, these criteria were predicted with various groups of statements. All together, 11 discriminant functions were used to estimate classification accuracy of the inventory. In Sample 1, 15 statements predicted the test criterion with classification accuracy of 98%, and 18 statements predicted the biographical criterion with classification accuracy of 97%. In Sample 2, 16 statements predicted the biographical criterion with classification accuracy of 94%. Estimations of positive and negative predictive value were 89% and 99%. Items of various discriminant functions were factor analysed to find characteristic difficulties of students with dyslexia, resulting in a five-factor structure in Sample 1 and a four-factor structure in Sample 2. Answer bias was investigated with measures of internal consistency reliability. Less than 20 self-report items are sufficient to accurately classify students with and without dyslexia. This supports the usefulness of self-assessment of dyslexia as a valid alternative to diagnostic test batteries.\n",

Thirty-four typically developing Italian children aged 8-10 years completed two specifically designed tasks: a production task and a perception task. Both tasks used nonwords containing clusters consisting of plosive plus liquid (e.g. pl). Clusters could be either in a stressed or in an unstressed syllable and could be either in initial position (first syllable) or in medial position (second syllable). In the production task, children were asked to repeat the nonwords. In the perception task, the children were asked to discriminate between two nonwords differing in one phoneme belonging to a cluster by reporting whether two repetitions were the same or different. Results from the production task showed that children are more accurate in repeating stressed than unstressed syllables, but there was no difference with respect to position of the cluster. Results from the perception task showed that children performed more accurately when discriminating word initial contrasts than when discriminating word medial contrasts, especially if the cluster was unstressed. Implications of this finding for clinical assessments are discussed.\n",

Music processing abilities and reading-related skills were evaluated for typically developing children and children with dyslexia. The results showed that pitch discrimination abilities of Chinese dyslexic children are not different from those of typically developing children. However, the former have poorer rhythm imitation abilities. Thus, in Chinese reading there is a strong relation between rhythm and reading acquisition, which is consistent with the research results on alphabetic languages. On the other hand, a significant correlation existed between the rhythm imitation ability and performance on the onset deletion test for all participants, which suggested that there was a close relation between the function of organizing the distinctive features in appropriate rhythmic pattern and the segmental phonological processing deficits of dyslexic children.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Greater functional connectivity between reading and error-detection regions following training with the reading acceleration program in children with reading difficulties.The Reading Acceleration Program is a computerized program that improves reading and the activation of the error-detection mechanism in individuals with reading difficulty (RD) and typical readers (TRs). The current study aims to find the neural correlates for this effect in English-speaking 8-12-year-old children with RD and TRs using a functional connectivity analysis. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected during a lexical decision task before and after 4 weeks of training with the program, together with reading and executive functions measures. Results indicated improvement in reading, visual attention, and speed of processing in children with RD. Following training, greater functional connectivity was observed between the left fusiform gyrus and the right anterior cingulate cortex in children with RD and between the left fusiform gyrus and the left anterior cingulate cortex in TRs. The change in functional connectivity after training was correlated with increased behavioral scores for word reading and visual attention in both groups. The results support previous findings of improved monitoring and mental lexicon after training with the Reading Acceleration Program in children with RD and TRs. The differences in laterality of the anterior cingulate cortex in children with RD and the presumable role of the cingulo-opercular control network in language processing are discussed.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The role of executive functions in bilingual children with reading difficulties.To explore the joint effect of reading difficulties (RD) and bilingualism on executive functions, 190 children of four groups of 9-12 year-olds (41 bilinguals with RD, 45 monolinguals with RD, 45 bilinguals without RD, and 59 monolinguals without RD) were examined on the Concentration game, Tower of Hanoi, and Stroop as measures of executive functioning tapping into inhibitory/attentional control, working memory and planning ability. The most prominent finding was that in terms of RD, the speed of performances decreased dramatically. This general decrease was more pronounced for bilingual children with RD than for their monolingual counterparts. In conclusion, the findings suggest that while bilinguals gain more from executive functions in normal reading, they lose in terms of RD. Such an outcome confirms that executive functions are essential components of both reading and bilingualism, which depending on whether reading conditions are normal or difficult will produce cognitive advantages or disadvantages. Further, it is argued that dissimilarity between the Farsi and Swedish languages may complicate handling of such a situation.\n",

Behavioural problems were assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Secondary analysis of a UK representative population-based sample of children (n = 12,631) was conducted using linear regression models. There were 284 children (2.2%) identified with SWRD at age 7 years. Children with SWRD had significantly higher scores on all measures of behavioural difficulties in unadjusted analysis. SWRD was associated with elevated behavioural difficulties at age 11 years according to parent report, and with greater emotional problems, hyperactivity and conduct issues according to teachers, even after having controlled for baseline difficulties. These results were replicated for children with low reading attainment, but no cognitive ability discrepancy. Categories of special educational need into which children with SWRD were classed at school were varied. Given high rates of co-occurring behavioural difficulties, assessment that identifies each individual child's specific functional, rather than categorical, difficulties is likely to be the most effective way of providing classroom support.\n",

In the last two decades, several studies have provided evidence that intervention for older school-age children with SLI can be effective. These metalinguistic intervention approaches teach grammatical rules explicitly and use shapes and colours as two-dimensional visual support.

Children referred for evaluation of learning disabilities in second through sixth grade (N = 205) were divided into four groups based on rapid automatized naming (RAN) and phonological awareness (PA) according to the DDH: the double-deficit group, the naming speed deficit-only group, the phonological deficit-only group, and the no-deficit group. The results supported the DDH in that the prevalence and severity of reading disability were greatest in the double-deficit group. Despite the greater prevalence of reading disabilities in single-deficit groups compared to the no-deficit group, the means of reading measures in the single-deficit groups were similar to those of the no-deficit group. The PA single-deficit group was poorer in spelling than the no-deficit group and single-naming-deficit group. Deficits in RAN or PA were primarily linked to reading disabilities but not with math or attention problems. The results supported the DDH partially and indicate that deficits in RAN and PA are specific to reading disabilities.\n",

Forty-eight studies met the criteria for the meta-analysis, yielding 735 effect sizes (ESs) with an overall weighted ES of 0.98. Small to high ESs in favor of children without RD emerged on measures of cognition (rapid naming [ES = 0.89], phonological awareness [ES = 1.00], verbal working memory [ES = 0.79], short-term memory [ES = 0.56], visual-spatial memory [ES = 0.48], and executive processing [ES = 0.67]), academic achievement (pseudoword reading [ES = 1.85], math [ES = 1.20], vocabulary [ES = 0.83], spelling [ES = 1.25], and writing [ES = 1.20]), and behavior skills (ES = 0.80). Hierarchical linear modeling indicated that specific cognitive process measures (verbal working memory, visual-spatial memory, executive processing, and short-term memory) and intelligence measures (general and verbal intelligence) significantly moderated overall group effect size differences. Overall, the results supported the assumption that cognitive deficits in children with RD are persistent.\n",

In this brief article, we take reading disorder (RD, also known as developmental dyslexia) as an example, and explore trends in neuroimaging research, which may have future implications for educational practice and policy. Specifically, we present two examples that have been central to research efforts in our laboratory: (a) utilizing multimodal neuroimaging to optimize criteria to diagnose RD, and (b) identifying neuroimaging markers that predict future academic outcomes. Such research is faced with important challenges, and rigorous validation is necessary before any claims of the widespread practical utility of neuroimaging can be made. Nevertheless, we contend that neuroimaging studies offer opportunities for providing critical information that could lead to advancing theory of reading and RD. This could in turn lead to better diagnostic criteria and more accurate and earlier identification of RD.\n",

Task performance by DCD+RD+ADHD children improved with training (P < .05); however, the improvement was significantly lower than that achieved by the other groups (RD+ADHD, ADHD and controls) (P < .05). In conclusion, children with DCD+RD+ADHD improve in their use of cognitive-motor procedures over a short training period.

The notion of a general deficit in the ability to acquire and retain procedural ('how to') knowledge as long-term procedural memory has been proposed. Here, we compared the ability of elementary school children, with and without reading difficulties (DD, typical readers), to improve their tactile discrimination with practice and tested the children's ability to retain the gains. Forty 10-11-year-olds practiced the tactile discrimination of four braille letters, presented as pairs, while blindfolded. In a trial, participants were asked to report whether the target stimuli were identical or different from each other. The structured training session consisted of six blocks of 16 trials each. Performance was re-tested at 24 hours and two weeks post-training. Both groups improved in speed and in accuracy. In session 1, children with DD started as significantly less accurate and were slower than the typical readers but showed rapid learning and successfully closed the gap. Only two children with DD failed to benefit from training and were not included in subsequent data analyses. At 24 hours post-training both groups showed effective retention of the gains in speed and accuracy. Importantly, children with DD were able to retain the gains in speed and accuracy, over a two-week interval as effectively as typical readers. Thus, children with DD were as effective in the acquisition and retention of tactile discrimination of braille letters as typical readers of the same age. The results do not support the notion of a general procedural learning disability in DD.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Evaluation of ocular movements in patients with dyslexia.The aims of this study were to analyze the relationship between dyslexia and eye movements and to assess whether this method can be added to the workup of dyslexic patients. The sample was comprised of 11 children with a diagnosis of dyslexia and 11 normal between 8 and 13 years of age. All subjects underwent orthoptic evaluation, ophthalmological examinations, and eye movement analysis, specifically, stability analysis on fixating a still target, tracking saccades, analysis of fixation pauses, speed reading, saccades, and regressions through the reading of a text. Stability analysis on fixating a still target showed a significant (p < 0.001) difference between the two groups showing an increased amount of loss of fixation among dyslexic subjects (5.36 ± 2.5 s and 0.82 ± 2.1, respectively). Tracking saccades (left and right horizontal axis) did not show a significant difference. When reading parameters were looked into (number of saccades, number of regressions, reading time through the reading of a text), a significant (p < 0.001) difference was found between the groups. This study supports the belief that the alteration of eye movement does not depend on oculo-motor dysfunction but is secondary to a defect in the visual processing of linguistic material. Inclusion of assessment of this defect might prove beneficial in determining the presence of dyslexia in young children at a younger age, and an earlier intervention could be initiated.\n",

It has also frequently been observed that literacy influences spoken language processing. Here, we investigated whether anticipatory spoken language processing is related to individuals' word reading abilities. Dutch adults with dyslexia and a control group participated in two eye-tracking experiments. Experiment 1 was conducted to assess whether adults with dyslexia show the typical language-mediated eye gaze patterns. Eye movements of both adults with and without dyslexia closely replicated earlier research: spoken language is used to direct attention to relevant objects in the environment in a closely time-locked manner. In Experiment 2, participants received instructions (e.g., 'Kijk naar de(COM) afgebeelde piano(COM)', look at the displayed piano) while viewing four objects. Articles (Dutch 'het' or 'de') were gender marked such that the article agreed in gender only with the target, and thus, participants could use gender information from the article to predict the target object. The adults with dyslexia anticipated the target objects but much later than the controls. Moreover, participants' word reading scores correlated positively with their anticipatory eye movements. We conclude by discussing the mechanisms by which reading abilities may influence predictive language processing.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Reading difficulties in Spanish adults with dyslexia.Recent studies show that dyslexia persists into adulthood, even in highly educated and well-read people. The main characteristic that adults with dyslexia present is a low speed when reading. In Spanish, a shallow orthographic system, no studies about adults with dyslexia are available; and it is possible that the consistency of the orthographic system favours the reading fluency. The aim of this study was to get an insight of the reading characteristics of Spanish adults with dyslexia and also to infer the reading strategies that they are using. For that purpose, a group of 30 dyslexics (M age = 32 years old) and an age-matched group of 30 adults without reading disabilities completed several phonological and reading tasks: phonological awareness tasks, rapid automatic naming, lexical decision, word and pseudoword reading, letter detection and text reading. The results showed that highly educated Spanish dyslexics performed significantly worse than the control group in the majority of the tasks. Specifically, they showed difficulties reading long pseudowords, indicating problems in automating the grapheme-phoneme rules, but they also seem to present difficulties reading words, which indicate problems with the lexical route. It seems that the Spanish dyslexic adults, as in deep orthographies, continue having difficulties in phonological awareness tasks, rapid naming and reading.\n",

Subsequent individual genotyping of those 100 individuals, and additional cases and controls from the Finnish and German populations, validated 92 out of 111 different single-nucleotide variants. A nonsynonymous polymorphism in DCDC2 (corrected P = 0.002) and a noncoding variant in S100B (corrected P = 0.016) showed a significant association with spelling performance in families of German origin. No significant association was found for the variants neither in the Finnish case-control sample set nor in the Finnish family sample set.

Some alterations are consistently reported, but others failed to reach significance. We investigated GM alterations in a large sample of Dutch students (37 dyslexics and 57 non-dyslexics) with two analyses: group differences in local GM and total GM and WM volume and correlations between GM and WM volumes and five behavioural measures. We found no significant group differences after corrections for multiple comparisons although total WM volume was lower in the group of dyslexics when age was partialled out. We presented an overview of uncorrected clusters of voxels (p < 0.05, cluster size k > 200) with reduced or increased GM volume. We found four significant correlations between factors of dyslexia representing various behavioural measures and the clusters found in the first analysis. In the whole sample, a factor related to performances in spelling correlated negatively with GM volume in the left posterior cerebellum. Within the group of dyslexics, a factor related to performances in Dutch-English rhyme words correlated positively with GM volume in the left and right caudate nucleus and negatively with increased total WM volume. Most of our findings were in accordance with previous reports. A relatively new finding was the involvement of the caudate nucleus. We confirmed the multiple cognitive nature of dyslexia and suggested that experience greatly influences anatomical alterations depending on various subtypes of dyslexia, especially in a student sample.\n",

The set of VEPs consisted of the pattern-reversal VEPs with check sizes of 20', two types of translational motion (with low and high contrast) and two types of radial motion (in the full field or the periphery). While the P100 peak parameters in pattern-reversal VEPs did not differ between the group of dyslexics and controls, the group of dyslexics displayed significantly longer N2 latencies in all types of M-VEPs. Abnormal N2 latencies were found in 35-56% of dyslexics in different types of M-VEPs, with translational motion with high contrast being the most sensitive stimulation. A receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the latencies of M-VEPs displayed higher discrimination potential than M-VEPs amplitudes.

      "ABSTRACT An assessment of gene-by-gene interactions as a tool to unfold missing heritability in dyslexia.Even if substantial heritability has been reported and candidate genes have been identified extensively, all known marker associations explain only a small proportion of the phenotypic variance of developmental dyslexia (DD) and related quantitative phenotypes. Gene-by-gene interaction (also known as \"epistasis\"--G × G) triggers a non-additive effect of genes at different loci and should be taken into account in explaining part of the missing heritability of this complex trait. We assessed potential G × G interactions among five DD candidate genes, i.e., DYX1C1, DCDC2, KIAA0319, ROBO1, and GRIN2B, upon DD-related neuropsychological phenotypes in 493 nuclear families with DD, by implementing two complementary regression-based approaches: (1) a general linear model equation whereby the trait is predicted by the main effect of the number of rare alleles of the two genes and by the effect of the interaction between them, and (2) a family-based association test to detect G × G interactions between two unlinked markers by splitting up the association effect into a between- and a within-family genetic orthogonal components. After applying 500,000 permutations and correcting for multiple testing, both methods show that G × G effects between markers within the DYX1C1, KIAA0319/TTRAP, and GRIN2B genes lower the memory letters composite z-score of on average 0.55 standard deviation. We provided initial evidence that the effects of familial transmission of synergistic interactions between genetic risk variants can be exploited in the study of the etiology of DD, explain part of its missing heritability, and assist in designing customized charts of individualized neurocognitive impairments in complex disorders, such as DD.\n",

      "ABSTRACT A cross-sectional study to assess the prevalence of DSM-5 specific learning disorders in representative school samples from the second to sixth grade in Brazil.Little is known about specific learning disorder (SLD) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and even less from representative school samples in small size cities outside huge urban centers. Few studies addressed the new DSM-5 criteria for SLDs. We investigated the prevalence of DSM-5 SLDs, their comorbidities and correlates in school samples of students from the second to sixth grades living in median cities from four different geographic regions in Brazil. A national test for academic performance covering reading, writing and mathematical abilities was applied. Psychiatric diagnoses were assessed by the K-SADS-PL applied to the primary caregiver. A total of 1618 children and adolescents were included in the study. The following prevalence rates of SLDs were found: 7.6% for global impairment, 5.4% for writing, 6.0% for arithmetic, and 7.5% for reading impairment. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was the only comorbidity significantly associated with SLD with global impairment (p = 0.031). Anxiety disorders and ADHD were associated with SLD with arithmetic impairment. Significant differences were detected in prevalence rates among cities, and several socio-demographic correlates (age, gender, IQ, and socioeconomic status) were significantly associated with SLD with global impairment in our sample. Careful validation and normatization of instruments to assess academic performance is a major problem in LMICs. As expected, we found a significant heterogeneity in prevalence rates of SLD according to geographic regions considering that Brazil is a country with a robust diversity. SLD with global and arithmetic impairment was significantly associated with psychiatric comorbidities.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Functional MRI in medulloblastoma survivors supports prophylactic reading intervention during tumor treatment.Development of reading skills is vulnerable to disruption in children treated for brain tumors. Interventions, remedial and prophylactic, are needed to mitigate reading and other learning difficulties faced by survivors. A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was conducted to investigate long-term effects of a prophylactic reading intervention administered during radiation therapy in children treated for medulloblastoma. The fMRI study included 19 reading-intervention (age 11.7 ± 0.6 years) and 21 standard-of-care (age 12.1 ± 0.6 years) medulloblastoma survivors, and 21 typically developing children (age 12.3 ± 0.6 years). The survivors were 2.5 [1.2, 5.4] years after completion of tumor therapies and reading-intervention survivors were 2.9 [1.6, 5.9] years after intervention. Five fMRI tasks (Rapid Automatized Naming, Continuous Performance Test using faces and letters, orthographic and phonological processing of letter pairs, implicit word reading, and story reading) were used to probe reading-related neural activation. Woodcock-Johnson Reading Fluency, Word Attack, and Sound Awareness subtests were used to evaluate reading abilities. At the time of fMRI, Sound Awareness scores were significantly higher in the reading-intervention group than in the standard-of-care group (p = 0.046). Brain activation during the fMRI tasks was detected in left inferior frontal, temporal, ventral occipitotemporal, and subcortical regions, and differed among the groups (p < 0.05, FWE). The pattern of group activation differences, across brain areas and tasks, was a normative trend in the reading-intervention group. Standardized reading scores and patterns of brain activation provide evidence of long-term effects of prophylactic reading intervention in children treated for medulloblastoma.\n",

Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that a two-factor model with separate naming speed (NS) and phonological awareness (PA) constructs was superior to a one-factor model, supporting the assumption within the DDH that NS is a source of reading dysfunction separable from PA. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses resulted in findings that were only partially supportive of the DDH. NS was predictive of word reading, spelling, and reading fluency beyond PA and verbal intellectual ability, but not pseudoword reading and timed and untimed reading comprehension. Examination of DDH subtypes did not support the core assumption of the DDH that the double-deficit subtype would have more impaired reading skills than both of the single-deficit subtypes. The NS deficit subtype was found to be more prevalent than the double-deficit and PA deficit subtypes within the subgroup of dyslexics with impairment in reading fluency. Overall results provided mixed support for the DDH and pointed to the need for the inclusion of additional abilities within theories of the underlying mechanisms disrupted in dyslexia.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Deficits in learning and memory in mice with a mutation of the candidate dyslexia susceptibility gene Dyx1c1.Dyslexia is a learning disability characterized by difficulty learning to read and write. The underlying biological and genetic etiology remains poorly understood. One candidate gene, dyslexia susceptibility 1 candidate 1 (DYX1C1), has been shown to be associated with deficits in short-term memory in dyslexic populations. The purpose of the current study was to examine the behavioral phenotype of a mouse model with a homozygous conditional (forebrain) knockout of the rodent homolog Dyx1c1. Twelve Dyx1c1 conditional homozygous knockouts, 7 Dyx1c1 conditional heterozygous knockouts and 6 wild-type controls were behaviorally assessed. Mice with the homozygous Dyx1c1 knockout showed deficits on memory and learning, but not on auditory or motor tasks. These findings affirm existing evidence that DYX1C1 may play an underlying role in the development of neural systems important to learning and memory, and disruption of this function could contribute to the learning deficits seen in individuals with dyslexia.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Magnetic resonance imaging findings for dyslexia: a review.Developmental dyslexia is a brain disorder that is associated with a disability to read, which affects both the behavior and the learning abilities of children. Recent advances in MRI techniques have enabled imaging of different brain structures and correlating the results to clinical findings. The goal of this paper is to cover these imaging studies in order to provide a better understanding of dyslexia and its associated brain abnormalities. In addition, this survey covers the noninvasive MRI-based diagnostics methods that can offer early detection of dyslexia. We focus on three MRI techniques: structural MRI, functional MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging. Structural MRI reveals dyslexia-associated volumetric and shape-based abnormalities in different brain structures (e.g., reduced grey matter volumes, decreased cerebral white matter gyrifications, increased corpus callosum size, and abnormal asymmetry of the cerebellum and planum temporale structures). Functional MRI reports abnormal activation patterns in dyslexia during reading operations (e.g., aggregated studies observed under-activations in the left hemisphere fusiform and supramarginal. gyri and over-activation in the left cerebellum in dyslexic subjects compared with controls). Finally, diffusion tensor imaging reveals abnormal orientations in areas within the white matter micro-structures of dyslexic brains (e.g., aggregated studies reported a reduction of the fraction anisotropy values in bilateral areas within the white matter). Herein, we will discuss all of these MRI findings focusing on various aspects of implemented methodologies, testing databases, as well as the reported findings. Finally, the paper addresses the correlation between the MRI findings in the literature, various aspects of research challenges, and future trends in this active research field.\n",

Previous studies have failed to isolate a single cause of the disorder, but several candidate genes have been reported. We measured motion perception in two groups of dyslexics, with and without a deletion within the DCDC2 gene, a risk gene for dyslexia. We found impairment for motion particularly strong at high spatial frequencies in the population carrying the deletion. The data suggest that deficits in motion processing occur in a specific genotype, rather than the entire dyslexia population, contributing to the large variability in impairment of motion thresholds in dyslexia reported in the literature.\n",

We explored their relationship in a sample of 259 college students (age range: 17 to 38 years-old) from three Chilean universities. The students were tested on their verbal ability, creativity, and insight. A simple linear regression was performed on the complete sample, and on high- and low-achievement groups that were formed based on reading test scores. We observed a significant correlation in the total sample between outcomes on the verbal ability tasks, and on the creativity and insight tasks (range r =. 152 to r =. 356, ps <.001). Scores on the reading comprehension and phonological awareness tasks were the best predictors of performance on creativity and insight tasks (range β = .315 to β = .155, ps <.05). A comparison of the low- and high-scoring groups on verbal ability tasks yielded results to the same effect. These findings do not support the hypothesis that specific reading disability is associated with better performance on creative tasks.

      "ABSTRACT The attentional blink in typically developing and reading-disabled children.This study's research question was whether selective visual attention, and specifically the attentional blink (AB) as operationalized by a dual target rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task, can explain individual differences in word reading (WR) and reading-related phonological performances in typically developing children and reading-disabled subgroups. A total of 407 Dutch school children (Grades 3-6) were classified either as typically developing (n = 302) or as belonging to one of three reading-disabled subgroups: reading disabilities only (RD-only, n = 69), both RD and attention problems (RD+ADHD, n = 16), or both RD and a specific language impairment (RD+SLI, n = 20). The RSVP task employed alphanumeric stimuli that were presented in two blocks. Standardized Dutch tests were used to measure WR, phonemic awareness (PA), and alphanumeric rapid naming (RAN). Results indicate that, controlling for PA and RAN performance, general RSVP task performance contributes significant unique variance to the prediction of WR. Specifically, consistent group main effects for the parameter of AB(minimum) were found, whereas there were no AB-specific effects (i.e., AB(width) and AB(amplitude)) except for the RD+SLI group. Finally, there was a group by measurement interaction, indicating that the RD-only and comorbid groups are differentially sensitive for prolonged testing sessions. These results suggest that more general factors involved in RSVP processing may explain the group differences found.\n",

This study provides data on the comorbidity rates of specific learning difficulties and ADHD symptoms. We analyzed the data of 273 children with learning difficulties despite an at least average IQ, 57 children with low IQ, and 270 children without learning difficulties and average IQ (comparison group). We assessed children’s IQ and school achievement using standardized achievement tests. ADHD symptoms were assessed via parents’ ratings. Our results showed that only 5 % of both the control group and the group with solely mathematical difficulties fulfilled the criteria of an ADHD subtype according to the DSM-IV based on parents’ ratings. In contrast, this was the case in even 20 % of the children with difficulties in reading/writing and of those with low IQ. Compared to girls, boys in the control group had a 150% higher risk for matching the criteria of one of the ADHD subtypes in parents’ ratings, whereas boys with learning difficulties and those with low IQ had an even 200% to 600% higher risk for it. The relationship between learning difficulties and ADHD symptoms can be found predominantly in the inattentive type. Possible reasons for the results are discussed.\n",

First, our results demonstrate that adults with dyslexia are fundamentally impaired in the long-term acquisition of serial-order information. Second, dyslexic and control participants show comparable retention of the long-term serial-order representations in memory over a period of 1 month.

Dyslexia is classified into neurodevelopmental disorder in DSM-5 and is described as an alternative term for specific learning disorder that includes reading impairment. It seems that dyslexia will be recognized as a separate clinical entity. As in our country, clinical research for diagnosis and treatment is continually progressing. Our original reading aloud test is recognized as an official examination for dyslexia diagnosis and is indicated as a mark of the fee-for-service. The time has come when we must regard this disorder not only as a special needs education issue but also as a medical subject.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Metacognition and Reading: Comparing Three Forms of Metacognition in Normally Developing Readers and Readers with Dyslexia.Metacognition refers to 'cognition about cognition' and includes metacognitive knowledge, strategies and experiences (Efklides, 2008; Flavell, 1979). Research on reading has shown that better readers demonstrate more metacognitive knowledge than poor readers (Baker & Beall, 2009), and that reading ability improves through strategy instruction (Gersten, Fuchs, Williams, & Baker, 2001). The current study is the first to specifically compare the three forms of metacognition in dyslexic (N = 22) versus normally developing readers (N = 22). Participants read two factual texts, with learning outcome measured by a memory task. Metacognitive knowledge and skills were assessed by self-report. Metacognitive experiences were measured by predictions of performance and judgments of learning. Individuals with dyslexia showed insight into their reading problems, but less general knowledge of how to approach text reading. They more often reported lack of available reading strategies, but groups did not differ in the use of deep and surface strategies. Learning outcome and mean ratings of predictions of performance and judgments of learning were lower in dyslexic readers, but not the accuracy with which metacognitive experiences predicted learning. Overall, the results indicate that dyslexic reading and spelling problems are not generally associated with lower levels of metacognitive knowledge, metacognitive strategies or sensitivity to metacognitive experiences in reading situations.\n",

Their frequent association could be justified by a deficit of the procedural memory system, that subtends many of the cognitive, motor and linguistic abilities that are impaired in both DD and DCD.

      "ABSTRACT In search of methods enhancing fluency in reading: An examination of the relations between time constraints and processes of reading in readers of German.The attainment of fluency in reading is a major difficulty for reading-disabled people. Manipulations applied on the presentation of texts, leading to \"on-line\" effects on reading (i.e., while texts are manipulated), are one direction of examinations in search of methods affecting reading. The imposing of time constraints, by deleting one letter after the other from texts presented on a computer screen, has been established as such a method. In an attempt to further understand its nature, we tested the relations between time constraints and processes of reading: phonological decoding of small orthogrpahic units and the addressing of orthographic representations from the mental lexicon. We also examined whether the type of orthogrpahic unit deleted (lexical, sublexical, or nonlexical unit) has any additional effect. Participants were German fifth graders with (n = 29) or without (n = 34) reading disability. Time constraints enhanced fluency in reading in both groups, and to a similar extent, across conditions. Comprehension was unimpaired. These results place the very principle of time constraints, regardless of the orthographic unit manipulated, as a critical factor affecting fluency in reading. However, phonological decoding explained a significant amount of variance in fluency in reading across all conditions in reading-disabled children, whereas the addressing of orthographic representations was the consistent predictor of fluency in reading in regular readers. These results indicate a qualitative difference in the processes explaining the variance in fluency in reading in regular and reading-disabled readers and suggest that time constraints might not have an effect on the relations between these processes and reading performance.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Acquired spatial dyslexia.Acquired spatial dyslexia is a reading disorder frequently occurring after left or right posterior brain lesions. This article describes several types of spatial dyslexia with an attentional approach. After right posterior lesions, patients show left neglect dyslexia with errors on the left side of text, words, and non-words. The deficit is frequently associated with left unilateral spatial neglect. Severe left neglect dyslexia can be detected with unlimited exposure duration of words or non-words. Minor neglect dyslexia is detected with brief presentation of bilateral words, one in the left and one in the right visual field (phenomenon of contralesional extinction). Neglect dyslexia can be explained as a difficulty in orienting attention to the left side of verbal stimuli. With left posterior lesions, spatial dyslexia is also frequent but multiform. Right neglect dyslexia is frequent, but right unilateral spatial neglect is rare. Attentional dyslexia represents difficulty in selecting a stimulus, letter or word among other similar stimuli; it is a deficit of attentional selection, and the left hemisphere plays a crucial role in selection. Two other types of spatial dyslexia can be found after left posterior lesions: paradoxical ipsilesional extinction and stimulus-centred neglect dyslexia. Disconnections between left or right parietal attentional areas and the left temporal visual word form area could explain these deficits. Overall, a model of attention dissociating modulation, selection control, and selection positioning can help in understanding these reading disorders.\n",

Two hundred and forty-six pre-service teachers and 267 in-service teachers completed the Knowledge and Beliefs about Developmental Dyslexia Scale (KBDDS). In-service teachers scored significantly higher on the total scale, and on the symptoms/diagnosis and general information subscales, than pre-service teachers. The percentages for misconceptions and lack of information (\"do not know responses\") were higher for PSTs than for ISTs on the general information subscale, the symptoms/diagnosis subscale, and the treatment subscale. Analyses of individual items were conducted to differentiate concepts that teachers did not know from misconceptions. In-service teacher self-efficacy, years of teaching experience, post-graduate training in dyslexia, and prior exposure to a child with dyslexia were positively related to knowledge about dyslexia.

      "ABSTRACT Thinking outside the boxes: Using current reading models to assess and treat developmental surface dyslexia.Improving the reading performance of children with developmental surface dyslexia has proved challenging, with limited generalisation of reading skills typically reported after intervention. The aim of this study was to provide tailored, theoretically motivated intervention to two children with developmental surface dyslexia. Our objectives were to improve their reading performance, and to evaluate the utility of current reading models in therapeutic practice. Detailed reading and cognitive profiles for two male children with developmental surface dyslexia were compared to the results obtained by age-matched control groups. The specific area of single-word reading difficulty for each child was identified within the dual route model (DRM) of reading, following which a theoretically motivated intervention programme was devised. Both children showed significant improvements in single-word reading ability after training, with generalisation effects observed for untrained words. However, the assessment and intervention results also differed for each child, reinforcing the view that the causes and consequences of developmental dyslexia, even within subtypes, are not homogeneous. Overall, the results of the interventions corresponded more closely with the DRM than other current reading models, in that real word reading improved in the absence of enhanced nonword reading for both children.\n",

In addition, children with dyslexia also show problems in mathematics. However, for the latter, the underlying structural correlates have not been investigated. Sixteen children with dyslexia (mean age 9.8 years [0.39]) and 24 typically developing children (mean age 9.9 years [0.29]) group matched for age, gender, IQ, and handedness underwent 3 T MR diffusion tensor imaging as well as cognitive testing. Tract-Based Spatial Statistics were performed to correlate behavioral data with diffusion data. Children with dyslexia performed worse than controls in standardized verbal number tasks, such as arithmetic efficiency tests (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). In contrast, the two groups did not differ in the nonverbal number line task. Arithmetic efficiency, representing the total score of the four arithmetic tasks, multiplication, and division, correlated with diffusion measures in widespread areas of the white matter, including bilateral superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi in children with dyslexia compared to controls. Children with dyslexia demonstrated lower performance in verbal number tasks but performed similarly to controls in a nonverbal number task. Further, an association between verbal arithmetic efficiency and diffusion measures was demonstrated in widespread areas of the white matter suggesting compensatory mechanisms in children with dyslexia compared to controls. Taken together, poor fact retrieval in children with dyslexia is likely a consequence of deficits in the language system, which not only affects literacy skills but also impacts on arithmetic skills.\n",

Deficits in each of these skills appear causally related to problems in learning to read, and deficits in letter-sound knowledge and phonemic awareness appear to be remediable by suitable teaching.

Building on previous findings of decreased volume in the anterior lobe of the cerebellum, we utilized novel cerebellar segmentation procedures and probabilistic tractography to examine tracts that connect the anterior lobe of the cerebellum and cortical regions typically associated with reading: the temporoparietal (TP), occipitotemporal (OT), and inferior frontal (IF) regions. The sample included 29 reading impaired children and 27 typical readers. We found greater fractional anisotropy (FA) for the poor readers in tracts connecting the cerebellum with TP and IF regions relative to typical readers. In the OT region, FA was greater for the older poor readers, but smaller for the younger ones. This study provides evidence for discrete, regionally-bound functions of the cerebellum and suggests that projections from the anterior cerebellum appear to have a regulatory effect on cortical pathways important for reading.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Impaired Driving Performance as Evidence of a Magnocellular Deficit in Dyslexia and Visual Stress.High comorbidity and an overlap in symptomology have been demonstrated between dyslexia and visual stress. Several researchers have hypothesized an underlying or causal influence that may account for this relationship. The magnocellular theory of dyslexia proposes that a deficit in visuo-temporal processing can explain symptomology for both disorders. If the magnocellular theory holds true, individuals who experience symptomology for these disorders should show impairment on a visuo-temporal task, such as driving. Eighteen male participants formed the sample for this study. Self-report measures assessed dyslexia and visual stress symptomology as well as participant IQ. Participants completed a drive simulation in which errors in response to road signs were measured. Bivariate correlations revealed significant associations between scores on measures of dyslexia and visual stress. Results also demonstrated that self-reported symptomology predicts magnocellular impairment as measured by performance on a driving task. Results from this study suggest that a magnocellular deficit offers a likely explanation for individuals who report high symptomology across both conditions. While conclusions about the impact of these disorders on driving performance should not be derived from this research alone, this study provides a platform for the development of future research, utilizing a clinical population and on-road driving assessment techniques.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Pay Attention!: Sluggish Multisensory Attentional Shifting as a Core Deficit in Developmental Dyslexia.The aim of this review is to provide a background on the neurocognitive aspects of the reading process and review neuroscientific studies of individuals with developmental dyslexia, which provide evidence for amodal processing deficits. Hari, Renvall, and Tanskanen (2001) propose amodal sluggish attentional shifting (SAS) as a causal factor for temporal processing deficits in dyslexia. Undergirding this theory is the notion that when dyslexics are faced with rapid sequences of stimuli, their automatic attentional systems fail to disengage efficiently, which leads to difficulty when moving from one item to the next (Lallier et al., ). This results in atypical perception of rapid stimulus sequences. Until recently, the SAS theory, particularly the examination of amodal attentional deficits, was studied solely through the use of behavioural measures (Facoetti et al., ; Facoetti, Lorusso, Cattaneo, Galli, & Molteni, ). This paper examines evidence within the literature that provides a basis for further exploration of amodal SAS as an underlying deficit in developmental dyslexia.\n",

      "ABSTRACT A Computational Model of Implicit Memory Captures Dyslexics' Perceptual Deficits.Dyslexics are diagnosed for their poor reading skills, yet they characteristically also suffer from poor verbal memory and often from poor auditory skills. To date, this combined profile has been accounted for in broad cognitive terms. Here we hypothesize that the perceptual deficits associated with dyslexia can be understood computationally as a deficit in integrating prior information with noisy observations. To test this hypothesis we analyzed the performance of human participants in an auditory discrimination task using a two-parameter computational model. One parameter captures the internal noise in representing the current event, and the other captures the impact of recently acquired prior information. Our findings show that dyslexics' perceptual deficit can be accounted for by inadequate adjustment of these components; namely, low weighting of their implicit memory of past trials relative to their internal noise. Underweighting the stimulus statistics decreased dyslexics' ability to compensate for noisy observations. ERP measurements (P2 component) while participants watched a silent movie indicated that dyslexics' perceptual deficiency may stem from poor automatic integration of stimulus statistics. This study provides the first description of a specific computational deficit associated with dyslexia.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Developmental evaluation of atypical auditory sampling in dyslexia: Functional and structural evidence.Whether phonological deficits in developmental dyslexia are associated with impaired neural sampling of auditory information at either syllabic- or phonemic-rates is still under debate. In addition, whereas neuroanatomical alterations in auditory regions have been documented in dyslexic readers, whether and how these structural anomalies are linked to auditory sampling and reading deficits remains poorly understood. In this study, we measured auditory neural synchronization at different frequencies corresponding to relevant phonological spectral components of speech in children and adults with and without dyslexia, using magnetoencephalography. Furthermore, structural MRI was used to estimate cortical thickness of the auditory cortex of participants. Dyslexics showed atypical brain synchronization at both syllabic (slow) and phonemic (fast) rates. Interestingly, while a left hemispheric asymmetry in cortical thickness was functionally related to a stronger left hemispheric lateralization of neural synchronization to stimuli presented at the phonemic rate in skilled readers, the same anatomical index in dyslexics was related to a stronger right hemispheric dominance for neural synchronization to syllabic-rate auditory stimuli. These data suggest that the acoustic sampling deficit in development dyslexia might be linked to an atypical specialization of the auditory cortex to both low and high frequency amplitude modulations.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Relative Ease in Creating Detailed Orthographic Representations Contrasted with Severe Difficulties to Maintain Them in Long-term Memory Among Dyslexic Children.Most research into orthographic learning abilities has been conducted in English with typically developing children using reading-based tasks. In the present study, we examined the abilities of French-speaking children with dyslexia to create novel orthographic representations for subsequent use in spelling and to maintain them in long-term memory. Their performance was compared with that of chronological age (CA)-matched and reading age (RA)-matched control children. We used an experimental task designed to provide optimal learning conditions (i.e. 10 spelling practice trials) ensuring the short-term acquisition of the spelling of the target orthographic word forms. After a 1-week delay, the long-term retention of the targets was assessed by a spelling post-test. Analysis of the results revealed that, in the short term, children with dyslexia learned the novel orthographic word forms well, only differing from both CA and RA controls on the initial decoding of the targets and from CA controls on the first two practice trials. In contrast, a dramatic drop was observed in their long-term retention relative to CA and RA controls. These results support the suggestion of the self-teaching hypothesis (Share, 1995) that initial errors in the decoding and spelling of unfamiliar words may hinder the establishment of fully specified novel orthographic representations.\n",

Here, structural magnetic resonance imaging data of 17 Chinese reading disabled (RD) and 17 age-matched typically developing (TD) children were used to construct cortical thickness (sensitive to postnatal development) and surface area (sensitive to prenatal development) networks. In the thickness network, compared to TD, RD showed reduced nodal network properties (e.g., degree and betweenness) in the left hemisphere along with enhanced nodal properties mainly in the right hemisphere. As for the surface area network, compared to TD, RD demonstrated lower nodal properties in the posterior brain regions and higher nodal properties in the anterior brain regions. Furthermore, hubs in both the thickness and surface area networks in RD were more distributed in frontal areas and less distributed in parietal areas, whereas TD showed the opposite pattern. Altogether, these findings indicate that the aberrant structural connectivity in the dyslexic individuals was not only due to a late developmental effect reflected in the altered thickness network, but may also be a congenital effect during prenatal development, reflected in the altered surface network.\n",

Parafoveal preview benefits and parafoveal load costs in dyslexic adults.Two different forms of parafoveal dysfunction have been hypothesized as core deficits of dyslexic individuals: reduced parafoveal preview benefits (\"too little parafovea\") and increased costs of parafoveal load (\"too much parafovea\"). We tested both hypotheses in a single eye-tracking experiment using a modified serial rapid automatized naming (RAN) task. Comparisons between dyslexic and non-dyslexic adults showed reduced parafoveal preview benefits in dyslexics, without increased costs of parafoveal load. Reduced parafoveal preview benefits were observed in a naming task, but not in a silent letter-finding task, indicating that the parafoveal dysfunction may be consequent to the overload with extracting phonological information from orthographic input. Our results suggest that dyslexics' parafoveal dysfunction is not based on strict visuo-attentional factors, but nevertheless they stress the importance of extra-phonological processing. Furthermore, evidence of reduced parafoveal preview benefits in dyslexia may help understand why serial RAN is an important reading predictor in adulthood.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Mutation in CEP63 co-segregating with developmental dyslexia in a Swedish family.Developmental dyslexia is the most common learning disorder in children. Problems in reading and writing are likely due to a complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors, resulting in reduced power of studies of the genetic factors underlying developmental dyslexia. Our approach in the current study was to perform exome sequencing of affected and unaffected individuals within an extended pedigree with a familial form of developmental dyslexia. We identified a two-base mutation, causing a p.R229L amino acid substitution in the centrosomal protein 63 kDa (CEP63), co-segregating with developmental dyslexia in this pedigree. This mutation is novel, and predicted to be highly damaging for the function of the protein. 3D modelling suggested a distinct conformational change caused by the mutation. CEP63 is localised to the centrosome in eukaryotic cells and is required for maintaining normal centriole duplication and control of cell cycle progression. We found that a common polymorphism in the CEP63 gene had a significant association with brain white matter volume. The brain regions were partly overlapping with the previously reported region influenced by polymorphisms in the dyslexia susceptibility genes DYX1C1 and KIAA0319. We hypothesise that CEP63 is particularly important for brain development and might control the proliferation and migration of cells when those two events need to be highly coordinated.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Music Training Increases Phonological Awareness and Reading Skills in Developmental Dyslexia: A Randomized Control Trial.There is some evidence for a role of music training in boosting phonological awareness, word segmentation, working memory, as well as reading abilities in children with typical development. Poor performance in tasks requiring temporal processing, rhythm perception and sensorimotor synchronization seems to be a crucial factor underlying dyslexia in children. Interestingly, children with dyslexia show deficits in temporal processing, both in language and in music. Within this framework, we test the hypothesis that music training, by improving temporal processing and rhythm abilities, improves phonological awareness and reading skills in children with dyslexia. The study is a prospective, multicenter, open randomized controlled trial, consisting of test, rehabilitation and re-test (ID NCT02316873). After rehabilitation, the music group (N = 24) performed better than the control group (N = 22) in tasks assessing rhythmic abilities, phonological awareness and reading skills. This is the first randomized control trial testing the effect of music training in enhancing phonological and reading abilities in children with dyslexia. The findings show that music training can modify reading and phonological abilities even when these skills are severely impaired. Through the enhancement of temporal processing and rhythmic skills, music might become an important tool in both remediation and early intervention programs.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02316873\n",

      "ABSTRACT What automaticity deficit? Activation of lexical information by readers with dyslexia in a rapid automatized naming Stroop-switch task.Reading fluency is often predicted by rapid automatized naming (RAN) speed, which as the name implies, measures the automaticity with which familiar stimuli (e.g., letters) can be retrieved and named. Readers with dyslexia are considered to have less \"automatized\" access to lexical information, reflected in longer RAN times compared with nondyslexic readers. We combined the RAN task with a Stroop-switch manipulation to test the automaticity of dyslexic and nondyslexic readers' lexical access directly within a fluency task. Participants named letters in 10 × 4 arrays while eye movements and speech responses were recorded. Upon fixation, specific letter font colors changed from black to a different color, whereupon the participant was required to rapidly switch from naming the letter to naming the letter color. We could therefore measure reading group differences on \"automatic\" lexical processing, insofar as it was task-irrelevant. Readers with dyslexia showed obligatory lexical processing and a timeline for recognition that was overall similar to typical readers, but a delay emerged in the output (naming) phase. Further delay was caused by visual-orthographic competition between neighboring stimuli. Our findings outline the specific processes involved when researchers speak of \"impaired automaticity\" in dyslexic readers' fluency, and are discussed in the context of the broader literature in this field.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Verbal Short-Term Memory Deficits in Chinese Children with Dyslexia may not be a Problem with the Activation of Phonological Representations.This study explored the underlying mechanism of the verbal short-term memory deficit in Chinese children with developmental dyslexia. Twenty-four children with dyslexia and 28 age-matched normal readers participated in the study. They were required to memorize a visually presented series of six Chinese characters and identify them from a list also including code-specific distracters and non-code-specific distracters. Error rates were recorded and were higher for code-specific distracters in all three conditions, revealing phonological, visual, and semantic similarity effects respectively. Group comparisons showed a stronger phonological similarity effect in dyslexic group, suggesting intact activation of phonological representations of target characters. Children with dyslexia also exhibited a greater semantic similarity effect, revealing stronger activation of semantic representations, while visual similarity effects were equivalent to controls. These results suggest that the verbal short-term memory deficit in Chinese dyslexics might not stem from insufficient activation of phonological information. Based the semantic activation of target characters in dyslexics is greater than in controls, it is possible that the memory deficit of dyslexia is related with deficient inhibition of target semantic representations in short-term memory.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The relations between reading and spelling: an examination of subtypes of reading disability.Three groups of reading-disabled children were found in studies of English, German, and French: a group with a double deficit in reading and spelling, a group with a single spelling deficit, and a more rarely reported group presenting a single reading deficit. This study set out to examine whether these groups can be found in adults, readers and spellers of Hebrew, which differs from the previously studied orthographies in many aspects. To this end, Hebrew-speaking adults with or without reading disability were administered various literacy and literacy-related tests. Results confirm the existence of the same three groups. While all shared a phonological deficit, subtle differences in phonological decoding ability and in speed of processing distinguished between the groups. The study therefore suggests that the previously reported associations and dissociations between reading and spelling are not restricted to English, German, or French and may not be only developmental in nature.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Genetic variant in DIP2A gene is associated with developmental dyslexia in Chinese population.Increasing evidence suggests that there is a substantial heritable component including several risk loci and candidate genes for developmental dyslexia (DD). DIP2A has been identified to be partially deleted on chromosome region 21q22.3, which cosegregates with DD. And it fits into a theoretical molecular network of DD implicated in the development of DD. Compared with some DD candidate genes that have been extensively studied (e.g., DYX1C1, DCDC2, KIAA0319, and ROBO1), very little is known about the association between candidate gene DIP2A and DD susceptibility. And given the linguistic and genetic differences between Chinese and other Western populations, it is worthwhile validating the association of DIP2A in Chinese dyslexic children. Here, we investigated two genetic variants, selected by bioinformatics analysis, in DIP2A in a Chinese population with 409 dyslexic cases and 410 healthy controls. We observed a significantly increased DD risk associated with rs2255526 G allele (OR = 1.297, 95% CI = 1.036-1.623, Padjusted  = 0.023) and GG genotypes (OR = 1.833, 95% CI = 1.043-3.223, Padjusted  = 0.035), compared with their wild-type counterparts. In addition, it was marginally significantly associated with DD under the recessive model (OR = 1.677, 95% CI = 0.967-2.908, Padjusted  = 0.066) and the dominant model (OR = 1.314, 95% CI = 0.992-1.741, Padjusted  = 0.057). However, we found no evidence of an association of SNP rs16979358 with DD. In conclusion, this study showed that a genetic variant in the DIP2A gene was associated with increased DD risk in China.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Academic Achievement of University Students with Dyslexia.Broadened recruitment to higher education is on the agenda in many countries, and it is also widely recognized that the number of dyslexic students entering higher education is increasing. In Sweden, as in many other European countries, higher education institutions are required to accommodate students with dyslexia. The present study focuses on the study outcome for 50 students with diagnosed dyslexia, mainly in teacher education and nurses' training, at three universities in Northern Sweden. The students trusted their own ability to find information on the Internet but mistrusted their own abilities in reading course books and articles in English and in taking notes. The mean rate of study was 23.5 European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System credits per semester, which is slightly below the national baseline of 26.7. The results show that more than half of the students are examined at a normal rate of study but that about one fifth have a very low rate of study. Messages Most students with dyslexia can compensate for their reading problems. Taking notes during lessons and reading in foreign language may be especially difficult for students with dyslexia. Diagnoses should distinguish between reading comprehension and word decoding. More than half of the students with dyslexia can achieve at a normal rate of study. One-fifth of the students with dyslexia may need a longer period of study than other students.\n",

      "ABSTRACT DOES DYSLEXIA DEVELOP FROM LEFT-EYE DOMINANCE?The purpose of this theoretical analysis and synthesis is to indicate how left-eye sighting dominance may lead to reading failure through dysfunctional right hemisphere letter encoding. Differing compensatory strategies are postulated to lead to outcomes that include the development of the phonologically impaired and phonologically proficient subtypes of dyslexia as well as specific spelling disability. Evidence is presented indicating that these disorders might be prevented by delaying the introduction of letter writing until the age of 8 years. Early childhood speech categorization in children genetically at-risk of developing dyslexia is also considered from this perspective. Convergent support for this premature writing hypothesis is provided by a comparison with the development of the left-hand inverted writing posture.\n",

A second objective was to investigate whether comorbidity of RD and ADHD should be considered as an additive phenomenon as to RAN and PA. A total of 1,262 children, aged 8 to 13 years, were classified as RD ( n = 121), ADHD ( n = 17), comorbid (RD+ADHD; n = 16), or control ( n = 1,108). Phonological processing was assessed by standardized tests of PA and RAN. Disability groups were compared to each other and contrasted to the control group. Although results indicate substantial effects for all three disability groups on both types of phonological processing, and the RAN/PA compound measure in particular, effect sizes were considerably larger for the RD groups, as compared to the ADHD-only group.

      "ABSTRACT Facial speech gestures: the relation between visual speech processing, phonological awareness, and developmental dyslexia in 10-year-olds.Successful communication in everyday life crucially involves the processing of auditory and visual components of speech. Viewing our interlocutor and processing visual components of speech facilitates speech processing by triggering auditory processing. Auditory phoneme processing, analyzed by event-related brain potentials (ERP), has been shown to be associated with impairments in reading and spelling (i.e. developmental dyslexia), but visual aspects of phoneme processing have not been investigated in individuals with such deficits. The present study analyzed the passive visual Mismatch Response (vMMR) in school children with and without developmental dyslexia in response to video-recorded mouth movements pronouncing syllables silently. Our results reveal that both groups of children showed processing of visual speech stimuli, but with different scalp distribution. Children without developmental dyslexia showed a vMMR with typical posterior distribution. In contrast, children with developmental dyslexia showed a vMMR with anterior distribution, which was even more pronounced in children with severe phonological deficits and very low spelling abilities. As anterior scalp distributions are typically reported for auditory speech processing, the anterior vMMR of children with developmental dyslexia might suggest an attempt to anticipate potentially upcoming auditory speech information in order to support phonological processing, which has been shown to be deficient in children with developmental dyslexia.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Implicit learning of non-linguistic and linguistic regularities in children with dyslexia.One of the hallmarks of dyslexia is the failure to automatise written patterns despite repeated exposure to print. Although many explanations have been proposed to explain this problem, researchers have recently begun to explore the possibility that an underlying implicit learning deficit may play a role in dyslexia. This hypothesis has been investigated through non-linguistic tasks exploring implicit learning in a general domain. In this study, we examined the abilities of children with dyslexia to implicitly acquire positional regularities embedded in both non-linguistic and linguistic stimuli. In experiment 1, 42 children (21 with dyslexia and 21 typically developing) were exposed to rule-governed shape sequences; whereas in experiment 2, a new group of 42 children were exposed to rule-governed letter strings. Implicit learning was assessed in both experiments via a forced-choice task. Experiments 1 and 2 showed a similar pattern of results. ANOVA analyses revealed no significant differences between the dyslexic and the typically developing group, indicating that children with dyslexia are not impaired in the acquisition of simple positional regularities, regardless of the nature of the stimuli. However, within group t-tests suggested that children from the dyslexic group could not transfer the underlying positional rules to novel instances as efficiently as typically developing children.\n",

In the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children and Das-Naglieri Cognitive Assessment System, his performance was poor at simultaneous processing compared to sequential processing. He could not copy three-dimensional figures, and he could place only two out of eight blocks correctly in the second level models of Benton three-dimensional block construction test, showing visuospatial impairment typical of patients with PVL. Despite the relatively high score in VIQ, there was a gap among the scores of the subtests in the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities. He tended to get low scores in tests that required visual abilities. In addition, there was also an impairment in reading fluency tested by the Diagnostic Criteria and Medical Guideline for Specific Developmental Disorders. He was much less fluent in reading syllables, words or sentences (6.0 SD or more compared to 12-year-old boys). The relatively higher score in VIQ superficially suggests adequate language ability. However, in the present study, precise investigation revealed some discrepancies even within the field of language. Thus, defining stronger and weaker points of a patient is important in order to determine optimal medical or educational approaches.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Neurocognitive Development and Predictors of L1 and L2 Literacy Skills in Dyslexia: A Longitudinal Study of Children 5-11 Years Old.The aim of this study was to find valid neurocognitive precursors of literacy development in first language (L1, Norwegian) and second language (L2, English) in a group of children during their Pre-literacy, Emergent Literacy and Literacy stages, by comparing children with dyslexia and a typical group. Children who were 5 years old at project start were followed until the age of 11, when dyslexia was identified and data could be analysed in retrospect. The children's neurocognitive pattern changed both by literacy stage and domain. Visuo-spatial recall and RAN appeared as early precursors of L1 literacy, while phonological awareness appeared as early precursor of L2 English. Verbal long term memory was associated with both L1 and L2 skills in the Literacy stage. Significant group differences seen in the Pre-literacy and Emergent literacy stages decreased in the Literacy stage. The developmental variations by stage and domain may explain some of the inconsistencies seen in dyslexia research. Early identification and training are essential to avoid academic failure, and our data show that visuo-spatial memory and RAN could be suitable early markers in transparent orthographies like Norwegian. Phonological awareness was here seen as an early precursor of L2 English, but not of L1 Norwegian.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Prosody and reading: Temporal and melodic characteristics in the dyslexic child in reading and narration].Dyslexia is widely associated to a massive phonological awareness deficit. This deficit leads to difficulties in grapheme to phoneme conversions in reading and difficulties in words and sentences productions. The origin of the phonological deficit is partially explained by the magnocellular, cerebellar and articulatory theories. Recently, an increasing number of studies demonstrated the relationship between prosody and reading and, more specifically, the potential key role of suprasegmental phonology in the healthy development of phonological representations. The aim of this study is to explore part of prosodic features in dyslexics and normal developing children in reading and narration tasks, in French. We examined reading accuracy, reading rate, pauses frequency and duration, inter-pausal units (IPUs) duration and instantaneous variations of F0. Results show correct decoding skills for all subjects but a lack of automation of this procedure for dyslexics. Differences in pauses frequency and duration, IPUS duration and F0 variations observed between dyslexics and controls confirm the link between prosodic reading and automaticity. The longer pause duration in narrative form a temporal feature of dyslexic's production. This temporal characteristic reflects the cognitive cost done by a speech generation task involving lexical selection, syntactic planning and articulatory programming processes. This result is a first step towards evidence of a suprasegmental phonological deficit in spoken language that could be an early marker of later reading difficulties.\n",

Neuroimaging studies further indicate functional disruptions during language and print processing in school-age children with a retrospective report of early language delay. Behavioral data of 114 5-year-olds with a retrospective report of early language delay in infancy (N = 34) and those without (N = 80) and with a familial risk for dyslexia and those without are presented. Behaviorally, children with a retrospective report of early language delay exhibited reduced performance in language/reading-related measures. A voxel-based morphometry analysis in a subset (N = 46) demonstrated an association between reduced gray matter volume and early language delay in left-hemispheric middle temporal, occipital, and frontal regions. Alterations in middle temporal cortex in children with a retrospective report of early language delay were observed regardless of familial risk for dyslexia. Additionally, while children with isolated familial risk for dyslexia showed gray matter reductions in temporoparietal and occipitotemporal regions, these effects were most profound in children with both risk factors. An interaction effect of early language delay and familial risk was revealed in temporoparietal, occipital, and frontal cortex. Our findings support a cumulative effect of early behavioral and genetic risk factors on brain development and may ultimately inform diagnosis/treatment.\n",

The children with dyslexia showed substantial reading gains for the main word reading and spelling measures after training, improving at a faster rate than typical readers and waiting-list controls.

      "ABSTRACT Print-Tuning Lateralization and Handedness: an Event-Related Potential Study in Dyslexic Higher Education Students.Despite their ample reading experience, higher education students with dyslexia still show deficits in reading and reading-related skills. Lateralized print tuning, the early sensitivity to print of the left parietal cortex signalled by the N1 event-related potential (ERP) component, differs between beginning dyslexic readers and controls. For adults, the findings are mixed. The present study aims to investigate whether print tuning, as indexed by the N1 component, differs between 24 students with dyslexia and 15 non-dyslexic controls. Because handedness has been linked to lateralization, first, a separate analysis was conducted including only right-handed participants (n = 12 in both groups), like in most previous studies. ERPs were measured during a judgement task, requiring visual, phonological, or semantic judgments. In both groups, the N1 was earlier and stronger in the left than in the right hemisphere. However, when only strongly right-handed participants were evaluated, the N1 was less left-lateralized for participants with dyslexia as compared with controls. Participants with dyslexia had longer reaction times during the ERP experiment and performed worse on many reading (-related) tasks. These findings suggest that abnormal print tuning can still be found among higher education students with dyslexia and that handedness should be regarded in the study of print tuning.\n",

      "ABSTRACT White Matter Alterations in Infants at Risk for Developmental Dyslexia.Developmental dyslexia (DD) is a heritable condition characterized by persistent difficulties in learning to read. White matter alterations in left-lateralized language areas, particularly in the arcuate fasciculus (AF), have been observed in DD, and diffusion properties within the AF correlate with (pre-)reading skills as early as kindergarten. However, it is unclear how early these alterations can be observed. We investigated white matter structure in 14 infants with (FHD+; ages 6.6-17.6 months) and 18 without (FHD-; ages 5.1-17.6 months) familial risk for DD. Diffusion scans were acquired during natural sleep, and early language skills were assessed. Tractography for bilateral AF was reconstructed using manual and automated methods, allowing for independent validation of results. Fractional anisotropy (FA) was calculated at multiple nodes along the tracts for more precise localization of group differences. The analyses revealed significantly lower FA in the left AF for FHD+ compared with FHD- infants, particularly in the central portion of the tract. Moreover, expressive language positively correlated with FA across groups. Our results demonstrate that atypical brain development associated with DD is already present within the first 18 months of life, suggesting that the deficits associated with DD may result from altered structural connectivity in left-hemispheric regions.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Time-based prospective memory in adults with developmental dyslexia.Prospective memory (PM) is memory for delayed intentions. Despite its importance to everyday life, the few studies on PM function in adults with dyslexia which exist have relied on self-report measures. To determine whether self-reported PM deficits can be measured objectively, laboratory-based PM tasks were administered to 24 adults with dyslexia and 25 age- and IQ-matched adults without dyslexia. Self-report data indicated that people with dyslexia felt that time-based PM (TBPM; requiring responses at certain times in the future) was most problematic for them and so this form of PM was the focus of investigation. Whilst performing the ongoing task from which they were required to break out every 3 min to make a PM-related response, the participants were allowed to make clock checks whenever they wished. The cognitive demands made on ongoing behaviour were manipulated to determine whether loading executive resources had a mediating role in dyslexia-related deficits in PM, resulting in three tasks with varying working memory load. A semi-naturalistic TBPM task was also administered, in which the participants were asked to remind the experimenter to save a data file 40 min after being given this instruction. Dyslexia-related differences were found across all three computerized tasks, regardless of cognitive load. The adults with dyslexia made fewer correct PM responses and also fewer clock checks. On the semi-naturalistic task, the participants with dyslexia were less likely to remember to remind the experimenter to save the file. This is the first study to document PM deficits in dyslexia using objective measures of performance. Since TBPM impairments were found under more naturalistic conditions as well as on computerized tasks, the results have implications for workplace support for adults with dyslexia.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Predictability effect on N400 reflects the severity of reading comprehension deficits in aphasia.Predictability effect on N400, in which low predictability words elicited a larger N400 than high predictability words did over central to posterior electrodes, has been used to index difficulty of lexical retrieval and semantic integration of words in sentence comprehension. This study examined predictability effect on N400 in aphasic patients to determine if the properties of N400 are suited to indexing the severity of reading comprehension deficits. Patients with aphasia were divided into high and low ability groups based on scores on the reading comprehension subtest in the Chinese Concise Aphasia Test (CCAT). The two aphasia groups, a group of healthy elders who were age-matched to the aphasic participants, and a group of young adults, were requested to read sentences that either ended with highly predictable words or unexpected but plausible words, while undergoing electroencephalography (EEG). The young adult and healthy elderly groups exhibited the typical centro-parietal distributed effect of predictability on N400; however, healthy elders exhibited a reduced N400 effect in a delayed time window compared to the young adults. Compared with the elderly control, the high ability aphasia group exhibited a comparable N400 effect in a more restricted time window; by contrast, the low ability aphasia group exhibited a frontal distributed N400 in a much later time window (400-700 ms). These data suggest that the severity of reading comprehension deficits affects predictability effect on a set of N400 characteristics (i.e., amplitude, time window, and topographic distribution), which may be effective as ERP signatures in the evaluation of language recovery in aphasia.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Prefixes repel stress in reading aloud: Evidence from surface dyslexia.This study examined the importance of prefixes as sublexical cues for stress assignment during reading aloud English disyllabic words. In particular, we tested the hypothesis that prefixes repel stress (Rastle & Coltheart, 2000) by investigating the likelihood with which patients with surface dyslexia assign second-syllable stress to prefixed words. Five such patients were presented with three types of disyllabic words for reading aloud: 'regular' prefixed words with weak-strong stress pattern (e.g., remind); 'irregular' prefixed words with strong-weak stress pattern (e.g., reflex); and non-prefixed words with strong-weak stress pattern (e.g., scandal). Results showed that all five patients frequently regularized the strong-weak prefixed words by pronouncing them with second syllable stress. These regularization errors provide strong evidence for the functional role of prefixes in stress assignment during reading. Additional computational simulations using the rule-based algorithm for pronouncing disyllables developed by Rastle and Coltheart (2000) and the CDP++ model of reading aloud (Perry et al., 2010) allowed us to evaluate how these two opponent approaches to reading aloud fare in respect of the patient data.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Does Growth in the Executive System of Working Memory Underlie Growth in Literacy for Bilingual Children With and Without Reading Disabilities?This cohort-sequential study explored the components of working memory (WM) that underlie second language (L2) reading growth in 450 children at risk and not at risk for reading disabilities (RD) whose first language is Spanish. English language learners designated as balanced and nonbalanced bilinguals with and without risk for RD in Grades 1, 2, and 3 at Wave 1 were administered a battery of cognitive (short-term memory, WM, naming speed, and inhibition), vocabulary, and reading measures in Spanish and English. These same measures were administered 1 and 2 years later. Two important findings occurred: First, growth in the WM executive component was significantly related to growth in English word identification and passage comprehension when competing measures (phonological processing, naming speed, inhibition, and fluid intelligence) were entered into the multilevel growth model. Second, children defined as at risk for RD in Wave 1 had lower intercepts than children not at risk at Wave 3 across several measures of cognition, language, and achievement. However, except on measures of the executive component of WM, no significant group differences in linear growth emerged. These findings suggest that growth in L2 reading was tied to growth in the executive system of WM.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [A girl with dyslexia suspected to have Irlen syndrome, completely relieved by wearing tinted lenses].Irlen syndrome is a proposed perceptual processing disorder characterized by visual distortions while reading. Patients with this syndrome may experience light sensitivity, visual stress, and other related problems such as dyslexia. Tinted lenses and colored overlays have been designed to help individuals with the symptoms of Irlen syndrome. However, there is still debate over the effectiveness of these interventions and whether this syndrome actually exists. In this report, we describe a case involving an 8-year-old girl with dyslexia who experienced severe visual hypersensitivity and whose symptoms completely resolved after wearing tinted lenses. While it is possible that she experienced a psychogenic visual disturbance that was relieved because of the placebo effect, the clinical course of her symptoms matched the findings previously described by Irlen. The patient was unable to read without tinted lenses. With tinted lenses, she could read at the appropriate age level, suggesting that her difficulty was due to a problem in optical information processing. The concepts underlying Irlen syndrome are vaguely defined, and several groups insist that the visual stress associated with this syndrome might be responsible for dyslexia as well as other disorders. These ambiguous criteria may be responsible for the criticism over the validity of this condition. Although this was only an anecdotal case, our patient exhibited the core functional deficit described in Irlen syndrome and showed a dramatic improvement with tinted lenses; therefore, this case may facilitate investigations into the mechanism underlying Irlen syndrome, if it actually exists. Although further studies are required to confirm the validity of this syndrome and the treatment approach, Irlen syndrome should be recognized as a disorder since its symptoms can be easily relieved by wearing tinted lenses or color filters.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Neuropsychological status of French children with developmental dyslexia and/or developmental coordination disorder: Are both necessarily worse than one?Developmental dyslexia (DD) and developmental coordination disorder (DCD) co-occur frequently, raising the underlying question of shared etiological bases. We investigated the cognitive profile of children with DD, children with DCD, and children with the dual association (DD + DCD) to determine the inherent characteristics of each disorder and explore the possible additional impact of co-morbidity on intellectual, attentional, and psychosocial functioning. The participants were 8- to 12-year-olds (20 DD, 22 DCD, and 23 DD + DCD). Cognitive abilities were assessed by the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - Fourth Edition (WISC-IV) and the Continuous Performance Test - Second Edition (CPT-II) and behavioral impairments were evaluated by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). No differences were found between the three groups on attention testing (CPT-II) or psychosocial characteristics (CBCL), but a higher percentage of DD + DCD children had pathological scores on psychosocial scales. Significant between-group differences were observed on Processing Speed Index scores and the block design and symbol search subtests, where DD children fared better than DCD children. No significant differences were evident between the co-morbid vs. the pure groups. Our results clearly show significant differences between children with DD only and children with DCD only. In particular, visuo-spatial disabilities and heterogeneity of intellectual profile seem to be good markers of DCD. However, it should be noted that despite these distinct and separate characteristics, a common cognitive profile (weaknesses and strengths) is likely shared by both neurodevelopmental disorders. Surprisingly, concerning co-morbidity, DD + DCD association is not associated with a decrease in intellectual or attentional capacities.\n",

Prior attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis was correlated only with impaired handwriting. Parental ratings of inattention, but not hyperactivity, correlated with measures of written language but not oral language. Sustaining switching attention correlated with writing the alphabet from memory in manuscript or by keyboard and fast copying of a sentence with all the letters of the alphabet. Multiple regressions based on a principal component for composites of multiple levels of language (subword, word, and syntax/text) showed that measures of attention and executive function involving language processing rather than ratings of attention and executive function not specifically related to language accounted for more variance and identified more unique predictors in the composite outcomes for oral language, reading, and writing systems. Inhibition related to focused attention uniquely predicted outcomes for the oral language system. Findings are discussed in reference to implications for assessing and teaching students who are still learning to pay attention to heard and written language and self-regulate their language learning during middle childhood and adolescence.\n",

A large archival sample of university students with dyslexia (n = 193) and students with no reported literacy difficulties (n = 40) were compared on the BDT as well as on literacy and cognitive measures. Statistical analyses revealed the BDT to be a reliable (α = .72) and valid dyslexia screening tool with the capacity to effectively identify adults at risk of the disorder with an overall classification rate of 94% (sensitivity 96.4% and specificity 82.5%). In addition, higher indices of dyslexia risk on the BDT were associated with lower scores on standardized measures of literacy.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Executive Functions Contribute Uniquely to Reading Competence in Minority Youth.Competent reading requires various skills beyond those for basic word reading (i.e., core language skills, rapid naming, phonological processing). Contributing \"higher-level\" or domain-general processes include information processing speed and executive functions (working memory, strategic problem solving, attentional switching). Research in this area has relied on largely Caucasian samples, with limited representation of children from racial or ethnic minority groups. This study examined contributions of executive skills to reading competence in 761 children of minority backgrounds. Hierarchical linear regressions examined unique contributions of executive functions (EF) to word reading, fluency, and comprehension. EF contributed uniquely to reading performance, over and above reading-related language skills; working memory contributed uniquely to all components of reading; while attentional switching, but not problem solving, contributed to isolated and contextual word reading and reading fluency. Problem solving uniquely predicted comprehension, suggesting that this skill may be especially important for reading comprehension in minority youth. Attentional switching may play a unique role in development of reading fluency in minority youth, perhaps as a result of the increased demand for switching between spoken versus written dialects. Findings have implications for educational and clinical practice with regard to reading instruction, remedial reading intervention, and assessment of individuals with reading difficulty.\n",

NS is an established predictor of reading ability, but controversy remains over why it is related to reading. We used three techniques (stimulus manipulations to emphasize phonological and/or visual aspects, decomposition of NS times into pause and articulation components, and analysis of eye movements during task performance) with three groups of participants (children with dyslexia, ages 9-10; chronological-age [CA] controls, ages 9-10; reading-level [RL] controls, ages 6-7) to examine NS and the NS-reading relationship. Results indicated (a) for all groups, increasing visual similarity of the letters decreased letter naming efficiency and increased naming errors, saccades, regressions (rapid eye movements back to letters already fixated), pause times, and fixation durations; (b) children with dyslexia performed like RL controls and were less efficient, had longer articulation times, pause times, fixation durations, and made more errors and regressions than CA controls; and (c) pause time and fixation duration were the most powerful predictors of reading. We conclude that NS is related to reading via fixation durations and pause times: Longer fixation durations and pause times reflect the greater amount of time needed to acquire visual/orthographic information from stimuli and prepare the correct response.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Dyslexia and Substance Use in a University Undergraduate Population.A number of cognitive deficits are associated with dyslexia. However, only a limited amount of research has been performed exploring a putative link between dyslexia and substance use. As substance use is thought to involve a cognitive component, it is possible that the pattern of substance use would be different for dyslexic participants, when compared to nondyslexic controls. During the current study, a guiding hypothesis was that people with dyslexia would demonstrate less substance use than nondyslexic controls. Theories of memory activation, automaticity, and attentional bias in substance use suggest that cognitive components of substance use are important in the development and maintenance of continued substance use and it is thought that, at least some of these components, would be impaired in a dyslexic population.\n",

Multiple 2 (RD vs. No RD) × 2 (AD vs. No AD) factorial ANCOVAs showed that children with RD had selective impairments in counting and number transcoding efficiency. In contrast, children with AD performed poorly in most tasks, including symbolic and nonsymbolic magnitude comparisons, subitizing, number line estimation, number sets, number transcoding accuracy, and calculation. These findings provide further support that AD is characterized by multiple, heterogeneous underlying deficits.

      "ABSTRACT Orthographic processing deficits in developmental dyslexia: Beyond the ventral visual stream.Fast effortless reading has been associated with the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA), a region in the ventral visual stream that specializes in the recognition of letter strings. Several neuroimaging studies of dyslexia revealed an underactivation of this region. However, most of these studies used reading tasks and/or were carried out on adults. Given that fluent reading is severely impaired in dyslexics, any underactivation might simply reflect a well-established reading deficit in impaired readers and could be the consequence rather than the cause of dyslexia. Here, we designed a task that does not rely on reading per se but that tapped early visual orthographic processing that forms the basis of reading. Dyslexic children aged 8-12years and age-matched controls were asked to search for letters, digits, and symbols in 5-element strings (Experiment 1). This novel task was complemented by a classic task known to activate the VWFA, namely the passive viewing of pseudowords and falsefonts (Experiment 2). We found that in addition to significant group differences in the VWFA, dyslexic children showed a significant underactivation of the middle occipital gyrus (MOG) relative to the control group. Several areas in the MOG are known for their engagement in visuospatial processing, and it has been proposed that the MOG is necessary for ordering the symbols in unfamiliar strings. Our results suggest that the VWFA deficit might be secondary to an impairment of visuospatial processing in the MOG. We argue that efficient processing in MOG in the course of reading acquisition is critical for the development of effortless fast visual word recognition in the VWFA.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Disrupted white matter connectivity underlying developmental dyslexia: A machine learning approach.Developmental dyslexia has been hypothesized to result from multiple causes and exhibit multiple manifestations, implying a distributed multidimensional effect on human brain. The disruption of specific white-matter (WM) tracts/regions has been observed in dyslexic children. However, it remains unknown if developmental dyslexia affects the human brain WM in a multidimensional manner. Being a natural tool for evaluating this hypothesis, the multivariate machine learning approach was applied in this study to compare 28 school-aged dyslexic children with 33 age-matched controls. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging were acquired to extract five multitype WM features at a regional level: white matter volume, fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity. A linear support vector machine (LSVM) classifier achieved an accuracy of 83.61% using these MRI features to distinguish dyslexic children from controls. Notably, the most discriminative features that contributed to the classification were primarily associated with WM regions within the putative reading network/system (e.g., the superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, thalamocortical projections, and corpus callosum), the limbic system (e.g., the cingulum and fornix), and the motor system (e.g., the cerebellar peduncle, corona radiata, and corticospinal tract). These results were well replicated using a logistic regression classifier. These findings provided direct evidence supporting a multidimensional effect of developmental dyslexia on WM connectivity of human brain, and highlighted the involvement of WM tracts/regions beyond the well-recognized reading system in dyslexia. Finally, the discriminating results demonstrated a potential of WM neuroimaging features as imaging markers for identifying dyslexic individuals.\n",

Some authors maintain that, given the transparency of the reading system, non-lexical reading is the strategy followed predominantly by Spanish readers and for that reason these models are not appropriate to explain alexias (acquired dyslexias) in Spanish. Other authors, consider that since several cases of phonological, surface and deep alexia have been reported, dual-route reading models are applicable to Spanish in the same way that to the irregular writing systems. In order to contrast these two points of view, an analysis of the two main factors that influence the reading is made: characteristics of the Spanish orthography and characteristics of the Spanish readers. It is conclude that, (1) Due to its transparency, non-lexical reading represents -as in other transparent orthographies-- the initial reading strategy in Spanish; (2) the \"reading threshold\" (i.e., time required to become literate) is lower in Spanish because there are no irregular words to learn; (3) as reading experience increases, speed increases and lexical reading becomes used more; (4) Given the characteristics of the Spanish reading system, it is understandable that frequency of deep dyslexia is so low.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Tackling the 'dyslexia paradox': reading brain and behavior for early markers of developmental dyslexia.Developmental dyslexia is an unexplained inability to acquire accurate or fluent reading that affects approximately 5-17% of children. Dyslexia is associated with structural and functional alterations in various brain regions that support reading. Neuroimaging studies in infants and pre-reading children suggest that these alterations predate reading instruction and reading failure, supporting the hypothesis that variant function in dyslexia susceptibility genes lead to atypical neural migration and/or axonal growth during early, most likely in utero, brain development. Yet, dyslexia is typically not diagnosed until a child has failed to learn to read as expected (usually in second grade or later). There is emerging evidence that neuroimaging measures, when combined with key behavioral measures, can enhance the accuracy of identification of dyslexia risk in pre-reading children but its sensitivity, specificity, and cost-efficiency is still unclear. Early identification of dyslexia risk carries important implications for dyslexia remediation and the amelioration of the psychosocial consequences commonly associated with reading failure.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Reading changes in children and adolescents with dyslexia after transcranial direct current stimulation.Noninvasive brain stimulation offers the possibility to induce changes in cortical excitability and it is an interesting option as a remediation tool for the treatment of developmental disorders. This study aimed to investigate the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on reading and reading-related skills of children and adolescents with dyslexia. Nineteen children and adolescents with dyslexia performed different reading and reading-related tasks (word, nonword, and text reading; lexical decision; phonemic blending; verbal working memory; rapid automatized naming) in a baseline condition without tDCS and after 20 min of exposure to three different tDCS conditions: left anodal/right cathodal tDCS to enhance left lateralization of the parietotemporal region, right anodal/left cathodal tDCS to enhance right lateralization of the parietotemporal region, and sham tDCS. In text reading, results showed a significant reduction in errors after left anodal/right cathodal tDCS and an increase in errors after left cathodal/right anodal tDCS. No effect was found in the other reading and reading-related tasks. Our findings indicate for the first time that one session of tDCS modulates some aspects of reading performance of children and adolescents with dyslexia and that the effect is polarity dependent. These single-session results support a potential role of tDCS for developing treatment protocols and suggest possible parameters for tDCS treatment customization in children and adolescents with dyslexia.\n",

Following comprehensive, evidence-based differential diagnosis for dysgraphia (impaired handwriting), dyslexia (impaired word reading and spelling), and oral and written language learning disability (OWL LD), students completed 18 sessions of computerized instruction over about 3 months. The 11 students taught letter formation with sequential, numbered, colored arrow cues with full contours who wrote letters on lines added to iPAD screen showed more and stronger treatment effects than the 21 students taught using only visual motion cues for letter formation who wrote on an unlined computer monitor. Teaching to all levels of language in multiple functional language systems (by ear, eye, mouth, and hand) close in time resulted in significant gains in reading and writing skills for the group and in diagnosed SLD hallmark impairments for individuals; also, performance on computerized learning activities correlated with treatment gains. Results are discussed in reference to need for both accommodations and explicit instruction for persisting SLDs and the potential for computers to teach handwriting, morphophonemic orthographies, comprehension, and composition.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Implicit learning deficits among adults with developmental dyslexia.The aim of the present study was to investigate implicit learning processes among adults with developmental dyslexia (DD) using a visual linguistic artificial grammar learning (AGL) task. Specifically, it was designed to explore whether the intact learning reported in previous studies would also occur under conditions including minimal training and instructions that do not reveal the grammatical nature of the strings. Twenty-nine (14 DD and 15 typical development (TD)) adults were presented with letter sequences in the training phase and were asked to classify the test strings for their grammaticality. The results of the d' measures in the implicit task indicated that learning had occurred for both groups, as the proportion of hits exceeded the proportion of false alarms. However, a significant difference was found between the groups in their learning measures, as TD readers performed significantly better than individuals with DD, supporting the assumption of a deficit in implicit sequential learning processes among individuals with DD. In order to examine whether the deficit found in the first experiment was indeed due to a deficit in implicit processes, a second experiment was designed in which explicit instructions were given during an AGL task. Results of the explicit task strengthen the assumption that the deficit is indeed specific to implicit sequential processes, as no difference between the groups was found when participants were aware of the existence of the grammar underlying the strings. Theoretical and clinical implications are discussed.\n",

Children's trait anxiety had a significant direct negative relationship with RC and also mediated the association between preoccupation with RD and RC. Mothers' preoccupation with their children's RDs had a direct negative association with their children's RC. This association was also mediated through children's trait anxiety. No association was found between mothers' trait anxiety and children's RC. In a final model, RC was explained significantly by children's word reading fluency and trait anxiety as well as by their mothers' preoccupation with their children's RDs.

      "ABSTRACT Child and environmental risk factors predicting readiness for learning in children at high risk of dyslexia.We investigate the role of distal, proximal, and child risk factors as predictors of reading readiness and attention and behavior in children at risk of dyslexia. The parents of a longitudinal sample of 251 preschool children, including children at family risk of dyslexia and children with preschool language difficulties, provided measures of socioeconomic status, home literacy environment, family stresses, and child health via interviews and questionnaires. Assessments of children's reading-related skills, behavior, and attention were used to define their readiness for learning at school entry. Children at family risk of dyslexia and children with preschool language difficulties experienced more environmental adversities and health risks than controls. The risks associated with family risk of dyslexia and with language status were additive. Both home literacy environment and child health predicted reading readiness while home literacy environment and family stresses predicted attention and behavior. Family risk of dyslexia did not predict readiness to learn once other risks were controlled and so seems likely to be best conceptualized as representing gene-environment correlations. Pooling across risks defined a cumulative risk index, which was a significant predictor of reading readiness and, together with nonverbal ability, accounted for 31% of the variance between children.\n",

Subsequent longitudinal investigation of these patients was carried out, involving annual tests of early visual, visuoperceptual and visuospatial processing and assessment of reading ability. Follow-up assessments identified the evolution of a particular early visual processing deficit, excessive visual crowding; this deficit has been previously implicated in forms of dyslexia. Consistent with the link between crowding and reading dysfunction, follow-up assessments also revealed deterioration in both patients' reading ability. The current findings demonstrate a neurodegenerative approach towards understanding the relationship between visual crowding and the reading system, and suggest possible mechanisms for how excessive crowding may disrupt word recognition.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Neural basis of phonological awareness in beginning readers with familial risk of dyslexia-Results from shallow orthography.Phonological processing ability is a key factor in reading acquisition, predicting its later success or causing reading problems when it is weakened. Our aim here was to establish the neural correlates of auditory word rhyming (a standard phonological measure) in 102 young children with (FHD+) and without familial history of dyslexia (FHD-) in a shallow orthography (i.e. Polish). Secondly, in order to gain a deeper understanding on how schooling shapes brain activity to phonological awareness, a comparison was made of children who had had formal literacy instruction for several months (in first grade) and those who had not yet had any formal instruction in literacy (in kindergarten). FHD+ children compared to FHD- children in the first grade scored lower in an early print task and showed longer reaction times in the in-scanner rhyme task. No behavioral differences between FHD+ and FHD- were found in the kindergarten group. On the neuronal level, overall familial risk was associated with reduced activation in the bilateral temporal, tempo-parietal and inferior temporal-occipital regions, as well as the bilateral inferior and middle frontal gyri. Subcortically, hypoactivation was found in the bilateral thalami, caudate, and right putamen in FHD+. A main effect of the children's grade was present only in the left inferior frontal gyrus, where reduced activation for rhyming was shown in first-graders. Several regions in the ventral occipital cortex, including the fusiform gyrus, and in the right middle frontal and postcentral gyri, displayed an interaction between familial risk and grade. The present results show strong influence of familial risk that may actually increase with formal literacy instruction.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Reading prosody in Spanish dyslexics.Reading becomes expressive when word and text reading are quick, accurate and automatic. Recent studies have reported that skilled readers use greater pitch changes and fewer irrelevant pauses than poor readers. Given that developmental dyslexics have difficulty acquiring and automating the alphabetic code and developing orthographic representations of words, it is possible that their use of prosody when reading differs from that of typical readers. The goal of this study was to investigate whether the reading prosody of Spanish-speaking dyslexics differs from that of typical Spanish readers. Two experiments were performed. The first experiment involved 36 children (18 with dyslexia), and the second involved 46 adults (23 with dyslexia). Participants were asked to read aloud a text which included declarative, exclamatory and interrogative sentences. Data on pausing and reading rate (number of pauses, duration of pauses and utterances), pitch changes, intensity changes and syllable lengthening were extracted from the recordings. We found that dyslexic people read more slowly than typical readers and they also made more inappropriate and longer pauses, even as adults with considerable reading experience. We also observed that dyslexics differed from skilled readers in their use of some prosodic features, particularly pitch changes at the end of sentences. This is probably because they have trouble anticipating some structural features of prose, such as sentence ends.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Surface errors without semantic impairment in acquired dyslexia: a voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping study.Patients with surface dyslexia have disproportionate difficulty pronouncing irregularly spelled words (e.g. pint), suggesting impaired use of lexical-semantic information to mediate phonological retrieval. Patients with this deficit also make characteristic 'regularization' errors, in which an irregularly spelled word is mispronounced by incorrect application of regular spelling-sound correspondences (e.g. reading plaid as 'played'), indicating over-reliance on sublexical grapheme-phoneme correspondences. We examined the neuroanatomical correlates of this specific error type in 45 patients with left hemisphere chronic stroke. Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping showed a strong positive relationship between the rate of regularization errors and damage to the posterior half of the left middle temporal gyrus. Semantic deficits on tests of single-word comprehension were generally mild, and these deficits were not correlated with the rate of regularization errors. Furthermore, the deep occipital-temporal white matter locus associated with these mild semantic deficits was distinct from the lesion site associated with regularization errors. Thus, in contrast to patients with surface dyslexia and semantic impairment from anterior temporal lobe degeneration, surface errors in our patients were not related to a semantic deficit. We propose that these patients have an inability to link intact semantic representations with phonological representations. The data provide novel evidence for a post-semantic mechanism mediating the production of surface errors, and suggest that the posterior middle temporal gyrus may compute an intermediate representation linking semantics with phonology.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Teacher candidates' mastery of phoneme-grapheme correspondence: massed versus distributed practice in teacher education.Matching phonemes (speech sounds) to graphemes (letters and letter combinations) is an important aspect of decoding (translating print to speech) and encoding (translating speech to print). Yet, many teacher candidates do not receive explicit training in phoneme-grapheme correspondence. Difficulty with accurate phoneme production and/or lack of understanding of sound-symbol correspondence can make it challenging for teachers to (a) identify student errors on common assessments and (b) serve as a model for students when teaching beginning reading or providing remedial reading instruction. For students with dyslexia, lack of teacher proficiency in this area is particularly problematic. This study examined differences between two learning conditions (massed and distributed practice) on teacher candidates' development of phoneme-grapheme correspondence knowledge and skills. An experimental, pretest-posttest-delayed test design was employed with teacher candidates (n = 52) to compare a massed practice condition (one, 60-min session) to a distributed practice condition (four, 15-min sessions distributed over 4 weeks) for learning phonemes associated with letters and letter combinations. Participants in the distributed practice condition significantly outperformed participants in the massed practice condition on their ability to correctly produce phonemes associated with different letters and letter combinations.

      "ABSTRACT Altered neural circuits accompany lower performance during narrative comprehension in children with reading difficulties: an fMRI study.Narrative comprehension is a linguistic ability that is foundational for future reading ability. The aim of the current study was to examine the neural circuitry of children with reading difficulties (RD) compared to typical readers during a narrative-comprehension task. We hypothesized that due to deficient executive functions, which support narrative comprehension abilities, children with RD would display altered activation and functional connectivity, as well as lower performance on a narrative-comprehension task. Children with RD and typical readers were scanned during a narrative-comprehension task and administered reading behavioral tests. Children with RD scored significantly lower on the narrative-comprehension task than did typical readers. Composite activation maps showed more diffused activation during narrative comprehension in the RD group. Maps comparing the two reading groups showed more activation in the frontal lobes (regions responsible for executive functions), and functional connectivity showed higher global efficiency in children with RD than in typical readers. Global efficiency was negatively correlated with phonological awareness and reading and executive function scores in the entire study group. Children with RD may suffer from narrative-comprehension difficulties due to diffused activation of language areas, as was observed during a narrative-comprehension task. Greater effort in this task may be reflected by the engagement of brain regions related to executive functions and higher functional connectivity or attributed to difficulties in phonological processing and reading and executive functions. Therefore, the accommodation given to children with RD of reading aloud may need to be revised due to the observed difficulty in this domain.\n",

Study 1 included 37 participants who completed six trials of four different virtual Hebb-Williams maze configurations. A 2 × 4 × 6 mixed factorial repeated measures ANOVA indicated consistency in performance between humans and mice on these tasks, enabling us to translate across species. Study 2 included a total of 91 participants (age range = 8-13 years). Eighteen participants were identified with reading disorder by performance on the Woodcock-Johnson III Tests of Achievement. Participants completed six trials of five separate virtual Hebb-Williams maze configurations. A 2 × 5 × 6 mixed factorial ANCOVA (gender as covariate) indicated that individuals with reading impairment demonstrated impaired visuo-spatial performance on this task. Overall, results from this study suggest that we are able to translate behavioral deficits observed in genetic animal models of dyslexia to humans with reading impairment.

The deviant stimuli had either partial or full ART or FRT cues. The results showed that ART did not generate an MMR in either group, whereas both partial and full FRT cues generated MMR in control children while only full FRT cues generated MMR in children with dyslexia. These findings suggest that children, both controls and those with dyslexia, discriminate speech based on FRT cues and not ART cues.

      "ABSTRACT Reading disability and enhanced dynamic spatial reasoning: A review of the literature.Previous research on reading disabilities (RD) has primarily focused on the cause and expression of the disability. The vast majority of this research has focused on the disorder itself, although it has been proposed that RD embodies other qualities not necessarily related to language or reading deficits. In fact, strengths in nonverbal processing and visual-spatial talents have been proposed to exist in persons with RD. However, the limited empirical data on this matter have yielded inconsistent results. The purpose of this review was to examine this literature, focusing on research concerning dynamic and complex spatial processing or reasoning in people with dyslexia. Our review suggests that there is little evidence in support of a spatial advantage in people with dyslexia, and, in fact, the data show that RD samples most often perform worse or equal to non-RD samples. An exception to this general conclusion may be performance on holistic visualization of complex figures, where RD samples have consistently demonstrated faster response times even though accuracy rates often do not exceed that of controls. The possibility of a unique spatial processing neurology that develops through right-left hemisphere interactions in persons with RD is discussed based on preliminary fMRI data.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Dyslexic brain activation abnormalities in deep and shallow orthographies: A meta-analysis of 28 functional neuroimaging studies.We used coordinate-based meta-analysis to objectively quantify commonalities and differences of dyslexic functional brain abnormalities between alphabetic languages differing in orthographic depth. Specifically, we compared foci of under- and overactivation in dyslexic readers relative to nonimpaired readers reported in 14 studies in deep orthographies (DO: English) and in 14 studies in shallow orthographies (SO: Dutch, German, Italian, Swedish). The separate meta-analyses of the two sets of studies showed universal reading-related dyslexic underactivation in the left occipitotemporal cortex (including the visual word form area (VWFA)). The direct statistical comparison revealed higher convergence of underactivation for DO compared with SO in bilateral inferior parietal regions, but this abnormality disappeared when foci resulting from stronger dyslexic task-negative activation (i.e., deactivation relative to baseline) were excluded. Higher convergence of underactivation for DO compared with SO was further identified in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) pars triangularis, left precuneus, and right superior temporal gyrus, together with higher convergence of overactivation in the left anterior insula. Higher convergence of underactivation for SO compared with DO was found in the left fusiform gyrus, left temporoparietal cortex, left IFG pars orbitalis, and left frontal operculum, together with higher convergence of overactivation in the left precentral gyrus. Taken together, the findings support the notion of a biological unity of dyslexia, with additional orthography-specific abnormalities and presumably different compensatory mechanisms. The results are discussed in relation to current functional neuroanatomical models of developmental dyslexia.

      "ABSTRACT Out-of-synchrony speech entrainment in developmental dyslexia.Developmental dyslexia is a reading disorder often characterized by reduced awareness of speech units. Whether the neural source of this phonological disorder in dyslexic readers results from the malfunctioning of the primary auditory system or damaged feedback communication between higher-order phonological regions (i.e., left inferior frontal regions) and the auditory cortex is still under dispute. Here we recorded magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals from 20 dyslexic readers and 20 age-matched controls while they were listening to ∼10-s-long spoken sentences. Compared to controls, dyslexic readers had (1) an impaired neural entrainment to speech in the delta band (0.5-1 Hz); (2) a reduced delta synchronization in both the right auditory cortex and the left inferior frontal gyrus; and (3) an impaired feedforward functional coupling between neural oscillations in the right auditory cortex and the left inferior frontal regions. This shows that during speech listening, individuals with developmental dyslexia present reduced neural synchrony to low-frequency speech oscillations in primary auditory regions that hinders higher-order speech processing steps. The present findings, thus, strengthen proposals assuming that improper low-frequency acoustic entrainment affects speech sampling. This low speech-brain synchronization has the strong potential to cause severe consequences for both phonological and reading skills. Interestingly, the reduced speech-brain synchronization in dyslexic readers compared to normal readers (and its higher-order consequences across the speech processing network) appears preserved through the development from childhood to adulthood. Thus, the evaluation of speech-brain synchronization could possibly serve as a diagnostic tool for early detection of children at risk of dyslexia.

      "ABSTRACT Developmental trajectories for children with dyslexia and low IQ poor readers.Reading difficulties are found in children with both high and low IQ and it is now clear that both groups exhibit difficulties in phonological processing. Here, we apply the developmental trajectories approach, a new methodology developed for studying language and cognitive impairments in developmental disorders, to both poor reader groups. The trajectory methodology enables identification of atypical versus delayed development in datasets gathered using group matching designs. Regarding the cognitive predictors of reading, which here are phonological awareness, phonological short-term memory (PSTM) and rapid automatized naming (RAN), the method showed that trajectories for the two groups diverged markedly. Children with dyslexia showed atypical development in phonological awareness, while low IQ poor readers showed developmental delay. Low IQ poor readers showed atypical PSTM and RAN development, but children with dyslexia showed developmental delay. These divergent trajectories may have important ramifications for supporting each type of poor reader, although all poor readers showed weakness in all areas. Regarding auditory processing, the developmental trajectories were very similar for the two poor reader groups. However, children with dyslexia demonstrated developmental delay for auditory discrimination of Duration, while the low IQ children showed atypical development on this measure. The data show that, regardless of IQ, poor readers have developmental trajectories that differ from typically developing children. The trajectories approach enables differences in trajectory classification to be identified across poor reader group, as well as specifying the individual nature of these trajectories.

      "ABSTRACT Development of Tract-Specific White Matter Pathways During Early Reading Development in At-Risk Children and Typical Controls.Developmental dyslexia is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a strong genetic basis. Previous studies observed white matter alterations in the left posterior brain regions in adults and school-age children with dyslexia. However, no study yet has examined the development of tract-specific white matter pathways from the pre-reading to the fluent reading stage in children at familial risk for dyslexia (FHD+) versus controls (FHD-). This study examined white matter integrity at pre-reading, beginning, and fluent reading stages cross-sectionally ( n = 78) and longitudinally (n = 45) using an automated fiber-tract quantification method. Our findings depict white matter alterations and atypical lateralization of the arcuate fasciculus at the pre-reading stage in FHD+ versus FHD- children. Moreover, we demonstrate faster white matter development in subsequent good versus poor readers and a positive association between white matter maturation and reading development using a longitudinal design. Additionally, the combination of white matter maturation, familial risk, and psychometric measures best predicted later reading abilities. Furthermore, within FHD+ children, subsequent good readers exhibited faster white matter development in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus compared with subsequent poor readers, suggesting a compensatory mechanism. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of white matter pathway maturation in the development of typical and atypical reading skills.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Machine learning and dyslexia: Classification of individual structural neuro-imaging scans of students with and without dyslexia.Meta-analytic studies suggest that dyslexia is characterized by subtle and spatially distributed variations in brain anatomy, although many variations failed to be significant after corrections of multiple comparisons. To circumvent issues of significance which are characteristic for conventional analysis techniques, and to provide predictive value, we applied a machine learning technique--support vector machine--to differentiate between subjects with and without dyslexia. In a sample of 22 students with dyslexia (20 women) and 27 students without dyslexia (25 women) (18-21 years), a classification performance of 80% (p < 0.001; d-prime = 1.67) was achieved on the basis of differences in gray matter (sensitivity 82%, specificity 78%). The voxels that were most reliable for classification were found in the left occipital fusiform gyrus (LOFG), in the right occipital fusiform gyrus (ROFG), and in the left inferior parietal lobule (LIPL). Additionally, we found that classification certainty (e.g. the percentage of times a subject was correctly classified) correlated with severity of dyslexia (r = 0.47). Furthermore, various significant correlations were found between the three anatomical regions and behavioural measures of spelling, phonology and whole-word-reading. No correlations were found with behavioural measures of short-term memory and visual/attentional confusion. These data indicate that the LOFG, ROFG and the LIPL are neuro-endophenotype and potentially biomarkers for types of dyslexia related to reading, spelling and phonology. In a second and independent sample of 876 young adults of a general population, the trained classifier of the first sample was tested, resulting in a classification performance of 59% (p = 0.07; d-prime = 0.65). This decline in classification performance resulted from a large percentage of false alarms. This study provided support for the use of machine learning in anatomical brain imaging.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Knockdown of Dyslexia-Gene Dcdc2 Interferes with Speech Sound Discrimination in Continuous Streams.Dyslexia is the most common developmental language disorder and is marked by deficits in reading and phonological awareness. One theory of dyslexia suggests that the phonological awareness deficit is due to abnormal auditory processing of speech sounds. Variants in DCDC2 and several other neural migration genes are associated with dyslexia and may contribute to auditory processing deficits. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that RNAi suppression of Dcdc2 in rats causes abnormal cortical responses to sound and impaired speech sound discrimination. In the current study, rats were subjected in utero to RNA interference targeting of the gene Dcdc2 or a scrambled sequence. Primary auditory cortex (A1) responses were acquired from 11 rats (5 with Dcdc2 RNAi; DC-) before any behavioral training. A separate group of 8 rats (3 DC-) were trained on a variety of speech sound discrimination tasks, and auditory cortex responses were acquired following training. Dcdc2 RNAi nearly eliminated the ability of rats to identify specific speech sounds from a continuous train of speech sounds but did not impair performance during discrimination of isolated speech sounds. The neural responses to speech sounds in A1 were not degraded as a function of presentation rate before training. These results suggest that A1 is not directly involved in the impaired speech discrimination caused by Dcdc2 RNAi. This result contrasts earlier results using Kiaa0319 RNAi and suggests that different dyslexia genes may cause different deficits in the speech processing circuitry, which may explain differential responses to therapy.\n",

Individuals born preterm are at risk of injury to white matter. In this study we compared the associations between diffusion properties of white matter and reading skills in children and adolescents born full term and preterm. 45 participants, aged 9-17 years, included 26 preterms (born < 36 weeks' gestation) and 19 full-terms. Tract fractional anisotropy (FA) profiles were generated for five bilateral white matter tracts previously associated with reading: anterior superior longitudinal fasciculus (aSLF), arcuate fasciculus (Arc), corticospinal tract (CST), uncinate fasciculus (UF) and inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF). Mean scores on reading for the two groups were in the normal range and were not statistically different. In both groups, FA was associated with measures of single word reading and comprehension in the aSLF, AF, CST, and UF. However, correlations were negative in the full term group and positive in the preterm group. These results demonstrate variations in the neurobiology of reading in children born full term and preterm despite comparable reading skills. Findings suggest that efficient information exchange required for strong reading abilities may be accomplished via a different balance of neurobiological mechanisms in different groups of readers.\n",

A group of 18 children with dyslexia in 3rd grade (9.05±0.46years old) was tested before and after following a letter-speech sound mapping training. A group of 20 third-grade typical readers (8.78±0.35years old) performed a single time on the same brain potential task. The training was differentially effective in speeding up reading fluency in the dyslexic children. In some children, training had a beneficial effect on reading fluency ('improvers') while a training effect was absent in others ('non-improvers'). Improvers at pre-training showed larger N170 amplitude to words compared to non-improvers. N170 amplitude decreased following training in improvers but not in non-improvers. But the N170 amplitude pattern in improvers continued to differ from the N170 amplitude pattern across hemispheres seen in typical readers. Finally, we observed a positive relation between the decrease in N170 amplitude and gains in reading fluency. Collectively, the results that emerged from the present study indicate the sensitivity of N170 amplitude to reading fluency and its potential as a predictor of reading fluency acquisition.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Adaptive specialization in position encoding while learning to read.The present experiments focused on how orthographic processing develops during reading acquisition. Specifically, a large, cross-sectional sample of children from grade 2 to grade 4 was exposed to pairs of words, pseudowords, digit strings, and pseudo-letter (Armenian) strings while their sensitivity to transpositions (T) and substitutions (S) of internal characters was investigated in a perceptual matching task. The results showed that the development of identity and position decoding diverged between the four stimulus categories. Most importantly, sensitivity improved with longer exposure to formal education and higher reading level to both S and T pairs for digit strings, but only to S pairs for words and pseudowords. The results were successfully reproduced in two small independent samples. We propose a general framework, the Adaptive Specialization Hypothesis, to accommodate the results. According to this hypothesis, the transposed-letter effect is not a hard-wired feature of the orthographic processing system but an adaptive response of the developing orthographic system to the constraints of lexical access in several orthographies.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The precursors of double dissociation between reading and spelling in a transparent orthography.Research and clinical practitioners have mixed views whether reading and spelling difficulties should be combined or seen as separate. This study examined the following: (a) if double dissociation between reading and spelling can be identified in a transparent orthography (Finnish) and (b) the cognitive and noncognitive precursors of this phenomenon. Finnish-speaking children (n = 1963) were assessed on reading fluency and spelling in grades 1, 2, 3, and 4. Dissociation groups in reading and spelling were formed based on stable difficulties in grades 1-4. The groups were compared in kindergarten phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming, letter knowledge, home literacy environment, and task-avoidant behavior. The results indicated that the double dissociation groups could be identified even in the context of a highly transparent orthography: 41 children were unexpected poor spellers (SD), 36 were unexpected poor readers (RD), and 59 were poor in both reading and spelling (RSD). The RSD group performed poorest on all cognitive skills and showed the most task-avoidant behavior, the RD group performed poorly particularly on rapid automatized naming and letter knowledge, and the SD group had difficulties on phonological awareness and letter knowledge. Fathers' shared book reading was less frequent in the RD and RSD groups than in the other groups. The findings suggest that there are discernible double dissociation groups with distinct cognitive profiles. This further suggests that the identification of difficulties in Finnish and the planning of teaching and remediation practices should include both reading and spelling assessments.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Development of parent’s judgment of behavioral problems from kindergarten to second grade in children dependent on their reading performance: First results of a longitudinal study].The development of reading disorders is complicated by frequently occurring comorbid behavioral disorders. Studies have shown this relation between behavior problems and learning disabilities but the causal relation is unclear so far. The present study investigates whether and in what way parents’ judgment (CBCL) of behavioral problems of children change from kindergarten to the end of second grade depending on children’s reading performance. Reading performance of 241 children was assessed every year from kindergarten to second grade. Parents judged children’s behavioral problems on CBCL. Variance analyses showed that poor readers are judged higher on the CBCL problem score and on externalizing behavior in first grade in comparison to kindergarten. In kindergarten, those children who were later classified as poor readers did not differ in externalizing and internalizing symptoms from good readers, but they had more attention problems. In first and second grade poor readers showed overall more behavior problems than good readers. Also the proportion of children with clinical relevant behavior disorders increased in the group of weak readers during first and second grade. The results indicate that the confrontation with performance requirements in school put a high burden on the children.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Association, characterisation and meta-analysis of SNPs linked to general reading ability in a German dyslexia case-control cohort.Dyslexia is a severe disorder in the acquisition of reading and writing. Several studies investigated the role of genetics for reading, writing and spelling ability in the general population. However, many of the identified SNPs were not analysed in case-control cohorts. Here, we investigated SNPs previously linked to reading or spelling ability in the general population in a German case-control cohort. Furthermore, we characterised these SNPs for functional relevance with in silico methods and meta-analysed them with previous studies. A total of 16 SNPs within five genes were included. The total number of risk alleles was higher in cases than in controls. Three SNPs were nominally associated with dyslexia: rs7765678 within DCDC2, and rs2038137 and rs6935076 within KIAA0319. The relevance of rs2038137 and rs6935076 was further supported by the meta-analysis. Functional profiling included analysis of tissue-specific expression, annotations for regulatory elements and effects on gene expression levels (eQTLs). Thereby, we found molecular mechanistical implications for 13 of all 16 included SNPs. SNPs associated in our cohort showed stronger gene-specific eQTL effects than non-associated SNPs. In summary, our results validate SNPs previously linked to reading and spelling in the general population in dyslexics and provide insights into their putative molecular pathomechanisms.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Anomalous gray matter patterns in specific reading comprehension deficit are independent of dyslexia.Specific reading comprehension deficit (SRCD) affects up to 10 % of all children. SRCD is distinct from dyslexia (DYS) in that individuals with SRCD show poor comprehension despite adequate decoding skills. Despite its prevalence and considerable behavioral research, there is not yet a unified cognitive profile of SRCD. While its neuroanatomical basis is unknown, SRCD could be anomalous in regions subserving their commonly reported cognitive weaknesses in semantic processing or executive function. Here we investigated, for the first time, patterns of gray matter volume difference in SRCD as compared to DYS and typical developing (TD) adolescent readers (N = 41). A linear support vector machine algorithm was applied to whole brain gray matter volumes generated through voxel-based morphometry. As expected, DYS differed significantly from TD in a pattern that included features from left fusiform and supramarginal gyri (DYS vs. TD: 80.0 %, p < 0.01). SRCD was well differentiated not only from TD (92.5 %, p < 0.001) but also from DYS (88.0 %, p < 0.001). Of particular interest were findings of reduced gray matter volume in right frontal areas that were also supported by univariate analysis. These areas are thought to subserve executive processes relevant for reading, such as monitoring and manipulating mental representations. Thus, preliminary analyses suggest that SRCD readers possess a distinct neural profile compared to both TD and DYS readers and that these differences might be linked to domain-general abilities. This work provides a foundation for further investigation into variants of reading disability beyond DYS.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Do dyslexic individuals present a reduced visual attention span? Evidence from visual recognition tasks of non-verbal multi-character arrays.A controversy has recently developed regarding the hypothesis that developmental dyslexia may be caused, in some cases, by a reduced visual attention span (VAS). To examine this hypothesis, independent of phonological abilities, researchers tested the ability of dyslexic participants to recognize arrays of unfamiliar visual characters. Employing this test, findings were rather equivocal: dyslexic participants exhibited poor performance in some studies but normal performance in others. The present study explored four methodological differences revealed between the two sets of studies that might underlie their conflicting results. Specifically, in two experiments we examined whether a VAS deficit is (a) specific to recognition of multi-character arrays as wholes rather than of individual characters within arrays, (b) specific to characters' position within arrays rather than to characters' identity, or revealed only under a higher attention load due to (c) low-discriminable characters, and/or (d) characters' short exposure. Furthermore, in this study we examined whether pure dyslexic participants who do not have attention disorder exhibit a reduced VAS. Although comorbidity of dyslexia and attention disorder is common and the ability to sustain attention for a long time plays a major rule in the visual recognition task, the presence of attention disorder was neither evaluated nor ruled out in previous studies. Findings did not reveal any differences between the performance of dyslexic and control participants on eight versions of the visual recognition task. These findings suggest that pure dyslexic individuals do not present a reduced visual attention span.\n",

      "ABSTRACT NRSN1 associated grey matter volume of the visual word form area reveals dyslexia before school.Literacy learning depends on the flexibility of the human brain to reconfigure itself in response to environmental influences. At the same time, literacy and disorders of literacy acquisition are heritable and thus to some degree genetically predetermined. Here we used a multivariate non-parametric genetic model to relate literacy-associated genetic variants to grey and white matter volumes derived by voxel-based morphometry in a cohort of 141 children. Subsequently, a sample of 34 children attending grades 4 to 8, and another sample of 20 children, longitudinally followed from kindergarten to first grade, were classified as dyslexics and controls using linear binary support vector machines. The NRSN1-associated grey matter volume of the 'visual word form area' achieved a classification accuracy of ~ 73% in literacy-experienced students and distinguished between later dyslexic individuals and controls with an accuracy of 75% at kindergarten age. These findings suggest that the cortical plasticity of a region vital for literacy might be genetically modulated, thereby potentially preconstraining literacy outcome. Accordingly, these results could pave the way for identifying and treating the most common learning disorder before it manifests itself in school.\n",

Patients suffering from a visual field defect to the left usually struggle to find the beginning of a line and read more fluently. It was suggested in the literature that changing the reading direction from horizontal to vertical may be a training strategy to reduce reading problems in patients with hemianopia.

      "ABSTRACT Cognitive and emotional empathy in typical and impaired readers and its relationship to reading competence.Studies indicate a strong relationship between empathy and language skills, but the relationship between reading and empathy remains elusive, although a shared neural substrate (the temporoparietal junction; TPJ) has been implicated in both reading and empathy. Motivated by these observations, the purpose of the current study was to examine empathic skills in a large spectrum of reading abilities, including typical readers and individuals with dyslexia, and their relationship to reading competence. We administered the Intrapersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) test, which differentiates between two subscales of empathy (cognitive and emotional empathy), to a group of participants with dyslexia and typical readers. Results indicate that the general reading score (average z scores of all reading tests) was significantly positively correlated with empathic scores. In addition, tests of specific reading abilities-decoding, reading fluency, and reading-related measures of phonological awareness-were significantly positively correlated with empathic scores. Finally, participants with dyslexia who showed low reading abilities had significantly lower scores in total empathy and cognitive empathy, as measured by the IRI test, than did typical participants with high reading abilities. Taken together, these results indicate a strong association between reading-related skills and empathic abilities and may point to involvement of the TPJ in both empathy and reading.\n",

Both disorders can have severe negative impact on children’s development. The aim of the present study was to compare attention and reading performance in children with ADHD, dyslexia and the comorbid condition. Ninety-nine German children in 3rd and 4th grade with ADHD (n = 26), dyslexia (n = 22) and the comorbid condition (n = 24) compared to a healthy control group (n = 27) were assessed with a model oriented assessment battery for reading and attention. Additionally, comorbid problems were examined. Children with ADHD were characterized by difficulties in decoding and reading comprehension, while children with dyslexia showed impairments in their attentional performance. Psychometric data revealed that children with dyslexia showed both externalizing and internalizing symptoms, while children with the comorbid condition scored the highest on all psychopathological dimensions. The results suggest, that reading problems in children with ADHD might be an epiphenomenon of the task used dependent on time constraints inherent to the task. Impairments of attentional functions in children with dyslexia emphasize the importance of a sufficient diagnostic procedure for subclinical ADHD symptoms as possible comorbid disorder. Future studies should focus the impact of early treatment of attentional deficits on reading acquisition.\n",

In phonological alexia, it has been shown that, despite relatively accurate reading of words in isolation, text-level reading deficits are often marked and persistent. Specifically, some individuals demonstrate difficulty reading functors and affixes in sentences, a profile referred to as phonological text alexia. In this paper, we demonstrate an analogous manifestation of the phonological impairment on text-level writing and suggest the term \"phonological text agraphia\". We examined four individuals with phonological alexia/agraphia who also showed disproportionate difficulty writing well-formed sentences in comparison to their grammatical competence in spoken utterances. Implementation of a phonological treatment protocol resulted in significantly improved sublexical phonology skills as well as improvements in grammatical accuracy of written narratives.

      "ABSTRACT Visual naming deficits in dyslexia: An ERP investigation of different processing domains.Naming speed deficits are well documented in developmental dyslexia, expressed by slower naming times and more errors in response to familiar items. Here we used event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine at what processing level the deficits in dyslexia emerge during a discrete-naming task. Dyslexic and skilled adult control readers performed a primed object-naming task, in which the relationship between the prime and the target was manipulated along perceptual, semantic and phonological dimensions. A 3×2 design that crossed Relationship Type (Visual, Phonemic Onset, and Semantic) with Relatedness (Related and Unrelated) was used. An attenuated N/P190 - indexing early visual processing - and N300 - which index late visual processing - was observed to pictures preceded by perceptually related (vs. unrelated) primes in the control but not in the dyslexic group. These findings suggest suboptimal processing in early stages of object processing in dyslexia, when integration and mapping of perceptual information to a more form-specific percept in memory take place. On the other hand, both groups showed an N400 effect associated with semantically related pictures (vs. unrelated), taken to reflect intact integration of semantic similarities in both dyslexic and control readers. We also found an electrophysiological effect of phonological priming in the N400 range - that is, an attenuated N400 to objects preceded by phonemic related primes vs. unrelated - while it showed a more widespread distributed and more pronounced over the right hemisphere in the dyslexics. Topographic differences between groups might have originated from a word form encoding process with different characteristics in dyslexics compared to control readers.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Brain mechanisms of recovery from pure alexia: A single case study with multiple longitudinal scans.Pure alexia is an acquired reading disorder, typically due to a left occipito-temporal lesion affecting the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA). It is unclear whether the VWFA acts as a unique bottleneck for reading, or whether alternative routes are available for recovery. Here, we address this issue through the single-case longitudinal study of a neuroscientist who experienced pure alexia and participated in 17 behavioral, 9 anatomical, and 9 fMRI assessment sessions over a period of two years. The origin of the impairment was assigned to a small left fusiform lesion, accompanied by a loss of VWFA responsivity and by the degeneracy of the associated white matter pathways. fMRI experiments allowed us to image longitudinally the visual perception of words, as compared to other classes of stimuli, as well as the mechanisms of letter-by-letter reading. The progressive improvement of reading was not associated with the re-emergence of a new area selective to words, but with increasing responses in spared occipital cortex posterior to the lesion and in contralateral right occipital cortex. Those regions showed a non-specific increase of activations over time and an increase in functional correlation with distant language areas. Those results confirm the existence of an alternative occipital route for reading, bypassing the VWFA, but they also point to its key limitation: the patient remained a slow letter-by-letter reader, thus supporting the critical importance of the VWFA for the efficient parallel recognition of written words.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Why is the processing of global motion impaired in adults with developmental dyslexia?Individuals with dyslexia are purported to have a selective dorsal stream impairment that manifests as a deficit in perceiving visual global motion relative to global form. However, the underlying nature of the visual deficit in readers with dyslexia remains unclear. It may be indicative of a difficulty with motion detection, temporal processing, or any task that necessitates integration of local visual information across multiple dimensions (i.e. both across space and over time). To disentangle these possibilities we administered four diagnostic global motion and global form tasks to a large sample of adult readers (N=106) to characterise their perceptual abilities. Two sets of analyses were conducted. First, to investigate if general reading ability is associated with performance on the visual tasks across the entire sample, a composite reading score was calculated and entered into a series of continuous regression analyses. Next, to investigate if the performance of readers with dyslexia differs from that of good readers on the visual tasks we identified a group of forty-three individuals for whom phonological decoding was specifically impaired, consistent with the dyslexic profile, and compared their performance with that of good readers who did not exhibit a phonemic deficit. Both analyses yielded a similar pattern of results. Consistent with previous research, coherence thresholds of poor readers were elevated on a random-dot global motion task and a spatially one-dimensional (1-D) global motion task, but no difference was found on a static global form task. However, our results extend those of previous studies by demonstrating that poor readers exhibited impaired performance on a temporally-defined global form task, a finding that is difficult to reconcile with the dorsal stream vulnerability hypothesis. This suggests that the visual deficit in developmental dyslexia does not reflect an impairment detecting motion per se. It is better characterised as a difficulty processing temporal information, which is exacerbated when local visual cues have to be integrated across multiple (>2) dimensions.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Neural encoding of the speech envelope by children with developmental dyslexia.Developmental dyslexia is consistently associated with difficulties in processing phonology (linguistic sound structure) across languages. One view is that dyslexia is characterised by a cognitive impairment in the \"phonological representation\" of word forms, which arises long before the child presents with a reading problem. Here we investigate a possible neural basis for developmental phonological impairments. We assess the neural quality of speech encoding in children with dyslexia by measuring the accuracy of low-frequency speech envelope encoding using EEG. We tested children with dyslexia and chronological age-matched (CA) and reading-level matched (RL) younger children. Participants listened to semantically-unpredictable sentences in a word report task. The sentences were noise-vocoded to increase reliance on envelope cues. Envelope reconstruction for envelopes between 0 and 10Hz showed that the children with dyslexia had significantly poorer speech encoding in the 0-2Hz band compared to both CA and RL controls. These data suggest that impaired neural encoding of low frequency speech envelopes, related to speech prosody, may underpin the phonological deficit that causes dyslexia across languages.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Left neglect dyslexia: Perseveration and reading error types.Right-brain-damaged patients may show a reading disorder termed neglect dyslexia. Patients with left neglect dyslexia omit letters on the left-hand-side (the beginning, when reading left-to-right) part of the letter string, substitute them with other letters, and add letters to the left of the string. The aim of this study was to investigate the pattern of association, if any, between error types in patients with left neglect dyslexia and recurrent perseveration (a productive visuo-motor deficit characterized by addition of marks) in target cancellation. Specifically, we aimed at assessing whether different productive symptoms (relative to the reading and the visuo-motor domains) could be associated in patients with left spatial neglect. Fifty-four right-brain-damaged patients took part in the study: 50 out of the 54 patients showed left spatial neglect, with 27 of them also exhibiting left neglect dyslexia. Neglect dyslexic patients who showed perseveration produced mainly substitution neglect errors in reading. Conversely, omissions were the prevailing reading error pattern in neglect dyslexic patients without perseveration. Addition reading errors were much infrequent. Different functional pathological mechanisms may underlie omission and substitution reading errors committed by right-brain-damaged patients with left neglect dyslexia. One such mechanism, involving the defective stopping of inappropriate responses, may contribute to both recurrent perseveration in target cancellation, and substitution errors in reading. Productive pathological phenomena, together with deficits of spatial attention to events taking place on the left-hand-side of space, shape the manifestations of neglect dyslexia, and, more generally, of spatial neglect.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The role of parieto-temporal connectivity in pure neglect dyslexia.The initial stages of reading are characterised by parallel and effortless access to letters constituting a word. Neglect dyslexia is an acquired reading disorder characterised by omission or substitution of the initial or the final letters of words. Rarely, the disorder appears in a'pure' form that is, without other signs of spatial neglect. Neglect dyslexia is linked to damage involving the inferior parietal lobe and regions of the temporal lobe, but the precise anatomical basis of the pure form of the disorder is unknown. Here, we show that pure neglect dyslexia is associated with decreased structural connectivity between the inferior parietal and lateral temporal lobe. We examined patient DM, who following bilateral occipito-parietal damage presented left neglect dyslexia together with right visual field loss, but no signs of spatial neglect. DM's reading errors were affected by word length and were much more frequent for pseudowords than for existing words. Most errors were omissions or substitutions of the first or second letter, and the spatial distribution of errors was similar for stimuli presented left or right of fixation. The brain lesions of DM comprised the inferior and superior parietal lobule as well as the cuneus and precuneus of the left hemisphere, and the angular gyrus and lateral occipital cortex of the right hemisphere. Diffusion tensor imaging revealed bilateral decrease of fibre tracts connecting the inferior parietal lobule with the superior and middle temporal cortex. These findings suggest that parieto-temporal connections play a significant role for the deployment of attention within words during reading.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Ciliary dyslexia candidate genes DYX1C1 and DCDC2 are regulated by Regulatory Factor X (RFX) transcription factors through X-box promoter motifs.DYX1C1, DCDC2, and KIAA0319 are three of the most replicated dyslexia candidate genes (DCGs). Recently, these DCGs were implicated in functions at the cilium. Here, we investigate the regulation of these DCGs by Regulatory Factor X transcription factors (RFX TFs), a gene family known for transcriptionally regulating ciliary genes. We identify conserved X-box motifs in the promoter regions of DYX1C1, DCDC2, and KIAA0319 and demonstrate their functionality, as well as the ability to recruit RFX TFs using reporter gene and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Furthermore, we uncover a complex regulation pattern between RFX1, RFX2, and RFX3 and their significant effect on modifying the endogenous expression of DYX1C1 and DCDC2 in a human retinal pigmented epithelial cell line immortalized with hTERT (hTERT-RPE1). In addition, induction of ciliogenesis increases the expression of RFX TFs and DCGs. At the protein level, we show that endogenous DYX1C1 localizes to the base of the cilium, whereas DCDC2 localizes along the entire axoneme of the cilium, thereby validating earlier localization studies using overexpression models. Our results corroborate the emerging role of DCGs in ciliary function and characterize functional noncoding elements, X-box promoter motifs, in DCG promoter regions, which thus can be targeted for mutation screening in dyslexia and ciliopathies associated with these genes.-Tammimies, K., Bieder, A., Lauter, G., Sugiaman-Trapman, D., Torchet, R., Hokkanen, M.-E., Burghoorn, J., Castrén, E., Kere, J., Tapia-Páez, I., Swoboda, P.

      "ABSTRACT Opposite Associations between Individual KIAA0319 Polymorphisms and Developmental Dyslexia Risk across Populations: A Stratified Meta-Analysis by the Study Population.KIAA0319 at the DYX2 locus is one of the most extensively studied candidate genes for developmental dyslexia (DD) owing to its important role in neuronal migration. Previous research on associations between KIAA0319 genetic variations and DD has yielded inconsistent results. It is important to establish a more precise estimate of the DD risk associated with these genetic variations. We carried out a meta-analysis of association studies involving KIAA0319 polymorphisms and DD risk. The results of pooled analysis indicated that none of the six investigated markers in or near the KIAA0319 gene are associated with DD. However, a stratified analysis by the study population revealed opposite associations involving KIAA0319 rs4504469 in European and Asian subgroups. The stratified analysis also showed that the KIAA0319 rs9461045 minor allele (T allele) has a protective effect in Asians. This meta-analysis has allowed us to establish the effects of specific KIAA0319 polymorphisms on DD risk with greater precision, as they vary across populations; analyzing one single nucleotide polymorphism at a time could not fully explain the genetic association for DD.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Associations Between the KIAA0319 Dyslexia Susceptibility Gene Variants, Antenatal Maternal Stress, and Reading Ability in a Longitudinal Birth Cohort.Maternal stress during pregnancy has been associated with detrimental cognitive developmental outcomes in offspring. This study investigated whether antenatal maternal perceived stress and variants of the rs12193738 and rs2179515 polymorphisms on the KIAA0319 gene interact to affect reading ability and full-scale IQ (FSIQ) in members of the longitudinal Auckland Birthweight Collaborative study. Antenatal maternal stress was measured at birth, and reading ability was assessed at ages 7 and 16. Reading data were available for 500 participants at age 7 and 479 participants at age 16. FSIQ was measured at ages 7 and 11. At age 11, DNA samples were collected. Analyses of covariance revealed that individuals with the TT genotype of the rs12193738 polymorphism exposed to high maternal stress during pregnancy possessed significantly poorer reading ability (as measured by Woodcock-Johnson Word Identification standard scores) during adolescence compared with TT carriers exposed to low maternal stress. TT carriers of the rs12193738 SNP also obtained lower IQ scores at age 7 than C allele carriers. These findings suggest that the KIAA0319 gene is associated with both reading ability and general cognition, but in different ways. The effect on IQ appears to occur earlier in development and is transient, whereas the effect of reading ability occurs later and is moderated by antenatal maternal stress.

      "ABSTRACT Birth Weight and Early Cognitive Skills: Can Parenting Offset the Link?Objectives There is an enduring negative association between low birth weight (<2500 g) and early childhood cognitive skills. This study examines if parenting practices meaningfully contribute to or offset birth weight disparities in cognitive development prior to formal schooling. Methods This study uses the ECLS-B, a nationally representative sample of live births in the United States in 2001. Unlike studies focused on one or two measures of parenting and investment, this study considers a wide array parenting measures collected at multiple time points, tracked from before birth across 5 years of development. Results Regression results show that nearly 50 % of the low-birth-weight gap in early math and reading ability is associated with family socioeconomic status. Between-family OLS regressions show that parenting practices, including \"parental interaction,\" \"cognitive stimulation,\" and \"parent quality\", are negatively associated with low birth weight and positively associated with improved cognitive skill among all children. After adjustment for family socioeconomic status, parenting practices did little to offset (by mediation or moderation) remaining birth weight disparities in early cognitive development. Conclusions Effective parenting is positively associated with cognitive development, but parenting is not a panacea-the developmental disadvantages associated with poor child health are not linked to parenting practices. We argue that birth weight disparities are rooted in biology and cannot easily be offset by parenting practices.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Dyslexics' usage of visual priors is impaired.Human perception benefits substantially from familiarity, via the formation of effective predictions of the environment's pattern of stimulation. Basic stimulation characteristics are automatically retrieved and integrated into our perception. A quantitatively measurable manifestation of the integration of priors is known as \"contraction to the mean\"; i.e., perception is biased toward the experienced mean. We previously showed that in the context of auditory discrimination, the magnitude of this bias is smaller among dyslexic individuals than among good readers matched for age and general reasoning skills. Here we examined whether a similarly reduced contraction characterizes dyslexics' behavior on serial visual tasks. Using serial spatial frequency discrimination tasks, we found that dyslexics' bias toward the experiment's mean spatial frequency was smaller than that observed for the controls. Thus, dyslexics' difficulties in automatic detection and integration of stimulus statistics are domain-general. These difficulties are likely to impede the acquisition of reading expertise.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Frontotemporal dementia and language networks: cortical thickness reduction is driven by dyslexia susceptibility genes.Variations within genes associated with dyslexia result in a language network vulnerability, and in patients with Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), language disturbances represent a disease core feature. Here we explored whether variations within three related-dyslexia genes, namely KIAA0319, DCDC2, and CNTNAP, might affect cortical thickness measures in FTD patients. 112 FTD patients underwent clinical and neuropsychological examination, genetic analyses and brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). KIAA0319 rs17243157 G/A, DCDC2 rs793842 A/G and CNTNAP2 rs17236239 A/G genetic variations were assessed. Cortical thickness was analysed by Freesurfer. Patients carrying KIAA0319 A*(AG or AA) carriers showed greater cortical thickness atrophy in the left fusiform and inferior temporal gyri, compared to KIAA0319 GG (p ≤ 0.001). Patients carrying CNTNAP2 G*(GA or GG) showed reduced cortical thickness in the left insula thenCNTNAP2 AA carriers (p≤0.001). When patients with both at-risk polymorphisms were considered (KIAA0319 A* and CNTNAP2 G*), greater and addictive cortical thickness atrophy of the left insula and the inferior temporal gyrus was demonstrated (p ≤ 0.001). No significant effect of DCDC2 was found. In FTD, variations of KIAA0319 and CNTNAP2 genes were related to cortical thickness abnormalities in those brain areas involved in language abilities. These findings shed light on genetic predisposition in defining phenotypic variability in FTD.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Are the literacy difficulties that characterize developmental dyslexia associated with a failure to integrate letters and speech sounds?The 'automatic letter-sound integration hypothesis' (Blomert, ) proposes that dyslexia results from a failure to fully integrate letters and speech sounds into automated audio-visual objects. We tested this hypothesis in a sample of English-speaking children with dyslexic difficulties (N = 13) and samples of chronological-age-matched (CA; N = 17) and reading-age-matched controls (RA; N = 17) aged 7-13 years. Each child took part in two priming experiments in which speech sounds were preceded by congruent visual letters (congruent condition) or Greek letters (baseline). In a behavioural experiment, responses to speech sounds in the two conditions were compared using reaction times. These data revealed faster reaction times in the congruent condition in all three groups. In a second electrophysiological experiment, responses to speech sounds in the two conditions were compared using event-related potentials (ERPs). These data revealed a significant effect of congruency on (1) the P1 ERP over left frontal electrodes in the CA group and over fronto-central electrodes in the dyslexic group and (2) the P2 ERP in the dyslexic and RA control groups. These findings suggest that our sample of English-speaking children with dyslexic difficulties demonstrate a degree of letter-sound integration that is appropriate for their reading level, which challenges the letter-sound integration hypothesis.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Network dynamics in dyslexia: Review and implications for remediation.Extant neurobiological theories of dyslexia appear fractional in focusing on isolated brain regions, mechanisms, and functional pathways. A synthesis of current research shows support for an Interactive Specialization (IS) model of dyslexia involving the dysfunctional orchestration of a widely-distributed, attentionally-controlled, hierarchical, and interhemispheric circuit of intercommunicating neuronal networks. This circuitry is comprised principally of the frontostriatal-parietal cognitive control system of networks, the posterior corpus callosum, and the left arcuate fasciculus. During development, the coalescence of these functionally specialized regions, acting together, may be essential to preventing the core phonemic and phonological processing deficits defining the dyslexic phenotype.

      "ABSTRACT Normal radial migration and lamination are maintained in dyslexia-susceptibility candidate gene homolog Kiaa0319 knockout mice.Developmental dyslexia is a common disorder with a strong genetic component, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unknown. Several candidate dyslexia-susceptibility genes, including KIAA0319, DYX1C1, and DCDC2, have been identified in humans. RNA interference experiments targeting these genes in rat embryos have shown impairments in neuronal migration, suggesting that defects in radial cortical migration could be involved in the disease mechanism of dyslexia. Here we present the first characterisation of a Kiaa0319 knockout mouse line. Animals lacking KIAA0319 protein do not show anatomical abnormalities in any of the layered structures of the brain. Neurogenesis and radial migration of cortical projection neurons are not altered, and the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of Kiaa0319-deficient neurons do not differ from those of wild-type neurons. Kiaa0319 overexpression in cortex delays radial migration, but does not affect final neuronal position. However, knockout animals show subtle differences suggesting possible alterations in anxiety-related behaviour and in sensorimotor gating. Our results do not reveal a migration disorder in the mouse model, adding to the body of evidence available for Dcdc2 and Dyx1c1 that, unlike in the rat in utero knockdown models, the dyslexia-susceptibility candidate mouse homolog genes do not play an evident role in neuronal migration. However, KIAA0319 protein expression seems to be restricted to the brain, not only in early developmental stages but also in adult mice, indicative of a role of this protein in brain function. The constitutive and conditional knockout lines reported here will be useful tools for further functional analyses of Kiaa0319.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Atypical right hemisphere response to slow temporal modulations in children with developmental dyslexia.Phase entrainment of neuronal oscillations is thought to play a central role in encoding speech. Children with developmental dyslexia show impaired phonological processing of speech, proposed theoretically to be related to atypical phase entrainment to slower temporal modulations in speech (<10Hz). While studies of children with dyslexia have found atypical phase entrainment in the delta band (~2Hz), some studies of adults with developmental dyslexia have shown impaired entrainment in the low gamma band (~35-50Hz). Meanwhile, studies of neurotypical adults suggest asymmetric temporal sensitivity in auditory cortex, with preferential processing of slower modulations by right auditory cortex, and faster modulations processed bilaterally. Here we compared neural entrainment to slow (2Hz) versus faster (40Hz) amplitude-modulated noise using fNIRS to study possible hemispheric asymmetry effects in children with developmental dyslexia. We predicted atypical right hemisphere responding to 2Hz modulations for the children with dyslexia in comparison to control children, but equivalent responding to 40Hz modulations in both hemispheres. Analyses of HbO concentration revealed a right-lateralised region focused on the supra-marginal gyrus that was more active in children with dyslexia than in control children for 2Hz stimulation. We discuss possible links to linguistic prosodic processing, and interpret the data with respect to a neural 'temporal sampling' framework for conceptualizing the phonological deficits that characterise children with developmental dyslexia across languages.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Multipoint genome-wide linkage scan for nonword repetition in a multigenerational family further supports chromosome 13q as a locus for verbal trait disorders.Verbal trait disorders encompass a wide range of conditions and are marked by deficits in five domains that impair a person's ability to communicate: speech, language, reading, spelling, and writing. Nonword repetition is a robust endophenotype for verbal trait disorders that is sensitive to cognitive processes critical to verbal development, including auditory processing, phonological working memory, and motor planning and programming. In the present study, we present a six-generation extended pedigree with a history of verbal trait disorders. Using genome-wide multipoint variance component linkage analysis of nonword repetition, we identified a region spanning chromosome 13q14-q21 with LOD = 4.45 between 52 and 55 cM, spanning approximately 5.5 Mb on chromosome 13. This region overlaps with SLI3, a locus implicated in reading disability in families with a history of specific language impairment. Our study of a large multigenerational family with verbal trait disorders further implicates the SLI3 region in verbal trait disorders. Future studies will further refine the specific causal genetic factors in this locus on chromosome 13q that contribute to language traits.\n",

      "ABSTRACT When transparency is opaque: Effects of diacritic marks and vowel letters on dyslexic Hebrew readers.The current study examined the effects of orthographic transparency and familiarity on brain mechanisms involved in word recognition in adult dyslexic Hebrew readers. We compared functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) brain activation in 21 dyslexic readers and 22 typical readers, and examined the effects of diacritic marks that provide transparent but less familiar information and vowel letters that increase orthographic transparency without compromising familiarity. Dyslexic readers demonstrated reduced activation in left supramarginal gyrus (SMG) as compared to typical readers, as well as different patterns of activation within the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Furthermore, in contrast to typical readers, dyslexic readers did not show increased activation for diacritics in left temporo-parietal junction regions, associated with mapping orthography to phonology. Nevertheless, both groups showed the facilitation effect of vowel letters on regions associated with lexical-semantic access. Altogether the results suggest that while typical readers can compensate for the reduced familiarity of pointed words with increased reliance on decoding of smaller units, dyslexic readers do not, and therefore they show a higher cost.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Examining the relationship between home literacy environment and neural correlates of phonological processing in beginning readers with and without a familial risk for dyslexia: an fMRI study.Developmental dyslexia is a language-based learning disability characterized by persistent difficulty in learning to read. While an understanding of genetic contributions is emerging, the ways the environment affects brain functioning in children with developmental dyslexia are poorly understood. A relationship between the home literacy environment (HLE) and neural correlates of reading has been identified in typically developing children, yet it remains unclear whether similar effects are observable in children with a genetic predisposition for dyslexia. Understanding environmental contributions is important given that we do not understand why some genetically at-risk children do not develop dyslexia. Here, we investigate for the first time the relationship between HLE and the neural correlates of phonological processing in beginning readers with (FHD+, n = 29) and without (FHD-, n = 21) a family history of developmental dyslexia. We further controlled for socioeconomic status to isolate the neurobiological mechanism by which HLE affects reading development. Group differences revealed stronger correlation of HLE with brain activation in the left inferior/middle frontal and right fusiform gyri in FHD- compared to FHD+ children, suggesting greater impact of HLE on manipulation of phonological codes and recruitment of orthographic representations in typically developing children. In contrast, activation in the right precentral gyrus showed a significantly stronger correlation with HLE in FHD+ compared to FHD- children, suggesting emerging compensatory networks in genetically at-risk children. Overall, our results suggest that genetic predisposition for dyslexia alters contributions of HLE to early reading skills before formal reading instruction, which has important implications for educational practice and intervention models.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Morphology and spelling in French students with dyslexia: the case of silent final letters.Spelling is a challenge for individuals with dyslexia. Phoneme-to-grapheme correspondence rules are highly inconsistent in French, which make them very difficult to master, in particular for dyslexics. One recurrent manifestation of this inconsistency is the presence of silent letters at the end of words. Many of these silent letters perform a morphological function. The current study examined whether students with dyslexia (aged between 10 and 15 years) benefit from the morphological status of silent final letters when spelling. We compared, their ability to spell words with silent final letters that are either morphologically justified (e.g., tricot, \"knit,\" where the final \"t\" is pronounced in morphologically related words such as tricoter, \"to knit\" and tricoteur \"knitter\") or not morphologically justified (e.g., effort, \"effort\") to that of a group of younger children matched for reading and spelling level. Results indicated that the dyslexic students' spelling of silent final letters was impaired in comparison to the control group. Interestingly, morphological status helped the dyslexics improve the accuracy of their choice of final letters, contrary to the control group. This finding provides new evidence of morphological processing in dyslexia during spelling.\n",

Participants were 176 children identified with reading and mathematics difficulties at the beginning of first grade. Data were collected on working memory, language, nonverbal reasoning, processing speed, decoding, numerical competence, incoming calculations, socioeconomic status, and gender at the beginning of first grade and on calculation performance at four time points: the beginning of first grade, the end of first grade, the end of second grade, and the end of third grade. Latent growth modeling analysis showed that numerical competence, incoming calculation, processing speed, and decoding skills significantly explained the variance in calculation performance at the beginning of first grade. Numerical competence and processing speed significantly explained the variance in calculation performance at the end of third grade. However, numerical competence was the only significant predictor of calculation development from the beginning of first grade to the end of third grade. Implications of these findings for early calculation instructions among young at-risk children are discussed.\n",

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to understand the perception toward neighbourhoods among adults with a series of the existing health conditions in a country-wide and population-based setting. Data were retrieved from and analysed in Scottish Household Survey, 2007-2008. Information on demographics, self-reported health conditions and perception toward neighbourhoods and the surrounding facilities was obtained by household interview. Analysis including chi-square test, t test and logistic regression modelling were performed. Of 19,150 Scottish adults (aged 16-80) included in the study cohort, 1079 (7.7 %) people were dissatisfied with their living areas; particularly for those who experienced harassment (15.4 %), did not recycle or with dyslexia, chest, digestive, mental and musculoskeletal problems. Twenty to forty per cent reported common neighbourhood problems including noise, rubbish, disputes, graffiti, harassment and drug misuse. People with heart or digestive problems were more dissatisfied with the existing parks and open space. People with arthritis, chest or hearing problems were more dissatisfied with the waste management condition. People with dyslexia were more dissatisfied with the existing public transportation. People with heart problems were more dissatisfied with the current street cleaning condition. People with hearing, vision, speech, learning problems or dyslexia were also more dissatisfied with sports and recreational facilities. People with heart, chest, skin, digestive, musculoskeletal, vision, learning, speech and mental disorders and dyslexia were more dissatisfied with their current neighbourhood environments.

      "ABSTRACT Dichotic listening as an index of lateralization of speech perception in familial risk children with and without dyslexia.Atypical language lateralization has been marked as one of the factors that may contribute to the development of dyslexia. Indeed, atypical lateralization of linguistic functions such as speech processing in dyslexia has been demonstrated using neuroimaging studies, but also using the behavioral dichotic listening (DL) method. However, so far, DL results have been mixed. The current study assesses lateralization of speech processing by using DL in a sample of children at familial risk (FR) for dyslexia. In order to determine whether atypical lateralization of speech processing relates to reading ability, or is a correlate of being at familial risk, the current study compares the laterality index of FR children who did and did not become dyslexic, and a control group of readers without dyslexia. DL was tested in 3rd grade and in 5/6th grade. Results indicate that at both time points, all three groups have a right ear advantage, indicative of more pronounced left-hemispheric processing. However, the FR-dyslexic children are less good at reporting from the left ear than controls and FR-nondyslexic children. This impediment relates to reading fluency.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Difficulties in auditory organization as a cause of reading backwardness? An auditory neuroscience perspective.Over 30 years ago, it was suggested that difficulties in the 'auditory organization' of word forms in the mental lexicon might cause reading difficulties. It was proposed that children used parameters such as rhyme and alliteration to organize word forms in the mental lexicon by acoustic similarity, and that such organization was impaired in developmental dyslexia. This literature was based on an 'oddity' measure of children's sensitivity to rhyme (e.g. wood, book, good) and alliteration (e.g. sun, sock, rag). The 'oddity' task revealed that children with dyslexia were significantly poorer at identifying the 'odd word out' than younger children without reading difficulties. Here we apply a novel modelling approach drawn from auditory neuroscience to study the possible sensory basis of the auditory organization of rhyming and non-rhyming words by children. We utilize a novel Spectral-Amplitude Modulation Phase Hierarchy (S-AMPH) approach to analysing the spectro-temporal structure of rhyming and non-rhyming words, aiming to illuminate the potential acoustic cues used by children as a basis for phonological organization. The S-AMPH model assumes that speech encoding depends on neuronal oscillatory entrainment to the amplitude modulation (AM) hierarchy in speech. Our results suggest that phonological similarity between rhyming words in the oddity task depends crucially on slow (delta band) modulations in the speech envelope. Contrary to linguistic assumptions, therefore, auditory organization by children may not depend on phonemic information for this task. Linguistically, it is assumed that 'book' does not rhyme with 'wood' and 'good' because the final phoneme differs. However, our auditory analysis suggests that the acoustic cues to this phonological dissimilarity depend primarily on the slower amplitude modulations in the speech envelope, thought to carry prosodic information. Therefore, the oddity task may help in detecting reading difficulties because phonological similarity judgements about rhyme reflect sensitivity to slow amplitude modulation patterns. Slower amplitude modulations are known to be detected less efficiently by children with dyslexia.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Reading in dyslexia across literacy development: A longitudinal study of effective connectivity.Dyslexia is a literacy disorder affecting the efficient acquisition of reading and writing skills. The disorder is neurobiological in origin. Due to its developmental nature, longitudinal studies of dyslexia are of essence. They are, however, relatively scarce. The present study took a longitudinal approach to cortical connectivity of brain imaging data in reading tasks in children with dyslexia and children with typical reading development. The participants were followed with repeated measurements through Pre-literacy (6 years old), Emergent Literacy (8 years old) and Literacy (12 years old) stages, using Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) when analysing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Even though there are a few longitudinal studies on effective connectivity in typical reading, to our knowledge, no studies have previously investigated these issues in relation to dyslexia. We set up a model of a brain reading network involving five cortical regions (inferior frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, and occipito-temporal cortex). Using DCM, connectivity measures were calculated for each connection in the model. These measures were further analysed using factorial ANOVA. The results showed that the difference between groups centred on connections going to and from the inferior frontal gyrus (two connections) and the occipito-temporal cortex (three connections). For all five connections, the typical group showed stable or decreasing connectivity measures. The dyslexia group, on the other hand, showed a marked up-regulation (occipito-temporal connections) or down-regulation (inferior frontal gyrus connections) from 6 years to 8 years, followed by normalization from 8 years to 12 years. We interpret this as a delay in the dyslexia group in developing into the Pre-literacy and Emergent literacy stages. This delay could possibly be detrimental to literacy development. By age 12, there was no statistically significant difference in connectivity between the groups, but differences in literacy skills were still present, and were in fact larger than when measured at younger ages.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Phonological skills, visual attention span, and visual stress in developmental dyslexia.In this study, we concurrently investigated 3 possible causes of dyslexia-a phonological deficit, visual stress, and a reduced visual attention span-in a large population of 164 dyslexic and 118 control French children, aged between 8 and 13 years old. We found that most dyslexic children showed a phonological deficit, either in terms of response accuracy (92.1% of the sample), speed (84.8%), or both (79.3%). Deficits in visual attention span, as measured by partial report ability, affected 28.1% of dyslexic participants, all of which also showed a phonological deficit. Visual stress, as measured by subjective reports of visual discomfort, affected 5.5% of dyslexic participants, not more than controls (8.5%). Although phonological variables explained a large amount of variance in literacy skills, visual variables did not explain any additional variance. Finally, children with comorbid phonological and visual deficits did not show more severe reading disability than children with a pure phonological deficit. These results (a) confirm the importance of phonological deficits in dyslexia; (b) suggest that visual attention span may play a role, but a minor one, at least in this population; (c) do not support any involvement of visual stress in dyslexia. Among the factors that may explain some differences with previously published studies, the present sample is characterized by very stringent inclusion criteria, in terms of the severity of reading disability and in terms of exclusion of comorbidities. This may exacerbate the role of phonological deficits to the detriment of other factors playing a role in reading acquisition. (PsycINFO Database Record\n",

      "ABSTRACT An Extension of the Procedural Deficit Hypothesis from Developmental Language Disorders to Mathematical Disability.Mathematical disability (MD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting math abilities. Here, we propose a new explanatory account of MD, the procedural deficit hypothesis (PDH), which may further our understanding of the disorder. According to the PDH of MD, abnormalities of brain structures subserving the procedural memory system can lead to difficulties with math skills learned in this system, as well as problems with other functions that depend on these brain structures. This brain-based account is motivated in part by the high comorbidity between MD and language disorders such as dyslexia that may be explained by the PDH, and in part by the likelihood that learning automatized math skills should depend on procedural memory. Here, we first lay out the PDH of MD, and present specific predictions. We then examine the existing literature for each prediction, while pointing out weaknesses and gaps to be addressed by future research. Although we do not claim that the PDH is likely to fully explain MD, we do suggest that the hypothesis could have substantial explanatory power, and that it provides a useful theoretical framework that may advance our understanding of the disorder.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Multi-parameter machine learning approach to the neuroanatomical basis of developmental dyslexia.Despite decades of research, the anatomical abnormalities associated with developmental dyslexia are still not fully described. Studies have focused on between-group comparisons in which different neuroanatomical measures were generally explored in isolation, disregarding potential interactions between regions and measures. Here, for the first time a multivariate classification approach was used to investigate grey matter disruptions in children with dyslexia in a large (N = 236) multisite sample. A variety of cortical morphological features, including volumetric (volume, thickness and area) and geometric (folding index and mean curvature) measures were taken into account and generalizability of classification was assessed with both 10-fold and leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) techniques. Classification into control vs. dyslexic subjects achieved above chance accuracy (AUC = 0.66 and ACC = 0.65 in the case of 10-fold CV, and AUC = 0.65 and ACC = 0.64 using LOOCV) after principled feature selection. Features that discriminated between dyslexic and control children were exclusively situated in the left hemisphere including superior and middle temporal gyri, subparietal sulcus and prefrontal areas. They were related to geometric properties of the cortex, with generally higher mean curvature and a greater folding index characterizing the dyslexic group. Our results support the hypothesis that an atypical curvature pattern with extra folds in left hemispheric perisylvian regions characterizes dyslexia.

      "ABSTRACT Is Reading Impairment Associated with Enhanced Holistic Processing in Comparative Visual Search?This study explores a proposition that individuals with dyslexia develop enhanced peripheral vision to process visual-spatial information holistically. Participants included 18 individuals diagnosed with dyslexia and 18 who were not. The experiment used a comparative visual search design consisting of two blocks of 72 trials. Each trial presented two halves of the display each comprising three kinds of shapes in three colours to be compared side-by-side. Participants performed a conjunctive search to ascertain whether the two halves were identical. In the first block, participants were provided no instruction regarding the visual-spatial processing strategy they were to employ. In the second block, participants were instructed to use a holistic processing strategy-to defocus their attention and perform the comparison by examining the whole screen at once. The results did not support the hypothesis associating dyslexia with talents for holistic visual processing. Using holistic processing strategy, both groups scored lower in accuracy and reacted faster, compared to the first block. Impaired readers consistently reacted more slowly and did not exhibit enhanced accuracy. Given the extant evidence of strengths for holistic visual processing in impaired readers, these findings are important because they suggest such strengths may be task dependent.

      "ABSTRACT Reading Processes of University Students with Dyslexia - An Examination of the Relationship between Oral Reading and Reading Comprehension.The purpose of this study was to examine the quality of oral reading and how it relates to reading comprehension in students with dyslexia. A group of Danish university students with dyslexia (n = 16) and a comparison group of students with no history of reading problems (n = 16) were assessed on their oral reading performance when reading a complex text. Along with reading speed, we measured not only the number and quality of reading errors but also the extent and semantic nature of the self-corrections during reading. The reading comprehension was measured through aided text retellings. The results showed that, as a group, the dyslexics performed poorer on most measures, but there were notable within-group differences in the reading behaviours and little association between how well university students with dyslexia read aloud and comprehended the text. These findings suggest that many dyslexics in higher education tend to focus their attention on one subcomponent of the reading process, for example, decoding or comprehension, because engaging in both simultaneously may be too demanding for them.

      "ABSTRACT The impact of central sparing on the word-length effect in hemianopia.Studies suggest that a word-length effect of up to 160 ms/letter distinguishes hemianopic dyslexia from pure alexia. However, partial preservation of central vision is common in right hemianopia, but its effects on single-word reading are unknown. Eighteen healthy subjects read single words with a gaze-contingent right hemianopia simulation that varied the degree of central sparing. Mean reading onset time declined with small degrees of central sparing, but the word-length effect did not decrease until sparing exceeded 3.15°. We next evaluated the effects of font size. Effects of central sparing were constant when expressed in number of letters, with a decline in word-length effect beginning as sparing approached 4 letters. We conclude that the effects of central sparing on mean reading onset time and the word-length effect are distinct. We provide diagnostic word-length criteria for discriminating between pure alexia and hemianopic dyslexia with various degrees of central sparing.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Genetic polymorphism of nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate is associated with developmental dyslexia in Chinese school-aged populations.Developmental dyslexia (DD) is a neurodevelopment disorder characterized by reading disabilities without apparent etiologies. Nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P) is a structural craniofacial malformation featured by isolated orofacial abnormalities. Despite substantial phenotypic differences, potential linkage between these two disorders has been suggested as prevalence of DD among NSCL/P patients was much higher than that in general populations. Previous neuroimaging studies observed impaired short-term memory in patients with DD and NSCL/P, respectively. Genetic factors have a fundamental role during neurodevelopment and craniofacial morphogenesis but there lacks of evidence to support the linkage between DD and NSCL/P at genetic level. A recent genome-wide association study in Chinese populations identified a number of genetic polymorphisms associated with NSCL/P. Herein, we selected three risk variants of NSCL/P namely rs8049367, rs4791774 and rs2235371, and performed association analysis with DD in a Chinese population consisting 631 elementary school-aged children with 288 dyslexic cases without NSCL/P and 343 healthy controls. After Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, the T allele of rs8049367 showed significant association with DD (OR=1.41, P=0.0085). It is an intergenic variant between CREBBP and ADCY9 located at 16p13.3. The CREBBP gene was reported to have an essential role during memory formation, although ADCY9 was involved in dental development. In future studies, understanding functional effects of rs8049367 on CERBBP and ADCY9 might contribute to explain underlying etiologies shared by DD and NSCL/P.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Phonemic-Morphemic dissociation in university students with dyslexia: an index of reading compensation?A phonological deficit constitutes a primary cause of developmental dyslexia, which persists into adulthood and can explain some aspects of their reading impairment. Nevertheless, some dyslexic adults successfully manage to study at university level, although very little is currently known about how they achieve this. The present study investigated at both the individual and group levels, whether the development of another oral language skill, namely, morphological knowledge, can be preserved and dissociated from the development of phonological knowledge. Reading, phonological, and morphological abilities were measured in 20 dyslexic and 20 non-dyslexic university students. The results confirmed the persistence of deficits in phonological but not morphological abilities, thereby revealing a dissociation in the development of these two skills. Moreover, the magnitude of the dissociation correlated with reading level. The outcome supports the claim that university students with dyslexia may compensate for phonological weaknesses by drawing on morphological knowledge in reading.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The Effects of Visual Attention Span and Phonological Decoding in Reading Comprehension in Dyslexia: A Path Analysis.Increasing evidence has shown visual attention span to be a factor, distinct from phonological skills, that explains single-word identification (pseudo-word/word reading) performance in dyslexia. Yet, little is known about how well visual attention span explains text comprehension. Observing reading comprehension in a sample of 105 high school students with dyslexia, we used a pathway analysis to examine the direct and indirect path between visual attention span and reading comprehension while controlling for other factors such as phonological awareness, letter identification, short-term memory, IQ and age. Integrating phonemic decoding efficiency skills in the analytic model, this study aimed to disentangle how visual attention span and phonological skills work together in reading comprehension for readers with dyslexia. We found visual attention span to have a significant direct effect on more difficult reading comprehension but not on an easier level. It also had a significant direct effect on pseudo-word identification but not on word identification. In addition, we found that visual attention span indirectly explains reading comprehension through pseudo-word reading and word reading skills. This study supports the hypothesis that at least part of the dyslexic profile can be explained by visual attention abilities. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Neural initialization of audiovisual integration in prereaders at varying risk for developmental dyslexia.Learning letter-speech sound correspondences is a major step in reading acquisition and is severely impaired in children with dyslexia. Up to now, it remains largely unknown how quickly neural networks adopt specific functions during audiovisual integration of linguistic information when prereading children learn letter-speech sound correspondences. Here, we simulated the process of learning letter-speech sound correspondences in 20 prereading children (6.13-7.17 years) at varying risk for dyslexia by training artificial letter-speech sound correspondences within a single experimental session. Subsequently, we acquired simultaneously event-related potentials (ERP) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans during implicit audiovisual presentation of trained and untrained pairs. Audiovisual integration of trained pairs correlated with individual learning rates in right superior temporal, left inferior temporal, and bilateral parietal areas and with phonological awareness in left temporal areas. In correspondence, a differential left-lateralized parietooccipitotemporal ERP at 400 ms for trained pairs correlated with learning achievement and familial risk. Finally, a late (650 ms) posterior negativity indicating audiovisual congruency of trained pairs was associated with increased fMRI activation in the left occipital cortex. Taken together, a short (<30 min) letter-speech sound training initializes audiovisual integration in neural systems that are responsible for processing linguistic information in proficient readers. To conclude, the ability to learn grapheme-phoneme correspondences, the familial history of reading disability, and phonological awareness of prereading children account for the degree of audiovisual integration in a distributed brain network. Such findings on emerging linguistic audiovisual integration could allow for distinguishing between children with typical and atypical reading development.

Similar measures of reading performance, the same measures of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity, and similar selection criteria were used in the two studies. In general, the patterns of results obtained from these two independent studies were highly similar. Thus, these results clearly illustrate the principle that findings from studies in quantitative behavioral genetics often replicate (Plomin et al., Perspectives on Psychological Science, Vol. 11, 2016, pp. 3-23).\n",

      "ABSTRACT The Nature of Verbal Short-Term Impairment in Dyslexia: The Importance of Serial Order.Verbal short-term memory (STM) impairment is one of the most consistent associated deficits observed in developmental reading disorders such as dyslexia. Few studies have addressed the nature of this STM impairment, especially as regards the ability to temporarily store serial order information. This question is important as studies in typically developing children have shown that serial order STM abilities are predictors of oral and written language development. Associated serial order STM deficits in dyslexia may therefore further increase the learning difficulties in these populations. In this mini review, we show that specific serial order STM impairment is frequently reported in both dyslexic children and adults with a history of dyslexia. Serial order STM impairment appears to occur for the retention of both verbal and visuo-spatial sequence information. Serial order STM impairment is, however, not a characteristic of every individual dyslexic subject and is not specific to dyslexia. Future studies need to determine whether serial order STM impairment is a risk factor which, in association with phonological processing deficits, can lead to dyslexia or whether serial order STM impairment reflects associated deficits causally unrelated to dyslexia.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Prosodic Similarity Effects in Short-Term Memory in Developmental Dyslexia.Children with developmental dyslexia are characterized by phonological difficulties across languages. Classically, this 'phonological deficit' in dyslexia has been investigated with tasks using single-syllable words. Recently, however, several studies have demonstrated difficulties in prosodic awareness in dyslexia. Potential prosodic effects in short-term memory have not yet been investigated. Here we create a new instrument based on three-syllable words that vary in stress patterns, to investigate whether prosodic similarity (the same prosodic pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables) exerts systematic effects on short-term memory. We study participants with dyslexia and age-matched and younger reading-level-matched typically developing controls. We find that all participants, including dyslexic participants, show prosodic similarity effects in short-term memory. All participants exhibited better retention of words that differed in prosodic structure, although participants with dyslexia recalled fewer words accurately overall compared to age-matched controls. Individual differences in prosodic memory were predicted by earlier vocabulary abilities, by earlier sensitivity to syllable stress and by earlier phonological awareness. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of prosodic similarity effects in short-term memory. The implications of a prosodic similarity effect for theories of lexical representation and of dyslexia are discussed. © 2016 The Authors. Dyslexia published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Performance of children with developmental dyslexia on high and low topological entropy artificial grammar learning task.Graph complexity as measured by topological entropy has been previously shown to affect performance on artificial grammar learning tasks among typically developing children. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of graph complexity on implicit sequential learning among children with developmental dyslexia. Our goal was to determine whether children's performance depends on the complexity level of the grammar system learned. We conducted two artificial grammar learning experiments that compared performance of children with developmental dyslexia with that of age- and reading level-matched controls. Experiment 1 was a high topological entropy artificial grammar learning task that aimed to establish implicit learning phenomena in children with developmental dyslexia using previously published experimental conditions. Experiment 2 is a lower topological entropy variant of that task. Results indicated that given a high topological entropy grammar system, children with developmental dyslexia who were similar to the reading age-matched control group had substantial difficulty in performing the task as compared to typically developing children, who exhibited intact implicit learning of the grammar. On the other hand, when tested on a lower topological entropy grammar system, all groups performed above chance level, indicating that children with developmental dyslexia were able to identify rules from a given grammar system. The results reinforced the significance of graph complexity when experimenting with artificial grammar learning tasks, particularly with dyslexic participants.\n",

Our findings revealed abnormalities for the dyslexia group in (i) P300 latency, globally, but greatest in frontal brain regions and (ii) decreased P300 amplitude confined to the central brain regions (Fig. 1). These findings reflect abnormalities associated with a diminished capacity to process mental workload as well as delayed processing of this information in children with dyslexia. Furthermore, the topographical distribution of these findings suggests a distinct spatial distribution for the observed P300 abnormalities. This information may be useful in future therapeutic or brain stimulation intervention trials.\n",

Among potential correlates, previous research has studied group differences between dyslexic and control participants in performance on statistical learning tasks. A statistical learning deficit has been proposed to be a potential cause and/or a marker effect for early detection of dyslexia. It is therefore of practical importance to evaluate the evidence for a group difference. From a theoretical perspective, such a group difference would provide information about the causal chain from statistical learning to reading acquisition. We provide a systematic review of the literature on such a group difference.

      "ABSTRACT The influences and outcomes of phonological awareness: a study of MA, PA and auditory processing in pre-readers with a family risk of dyslexia.The direct influence of phonological awareness (PA) on reading outcomes has been widely demonstrated, yet PA may also exert indirect influence on reading outcomes through other cognitive variables such as morphological awareness (MA). However, PA's own development is dependent and influenced by many extraneous variables such as auditory processing, which could ultimately impact reading outcomes. In a group of pre-reading children with a family risk of dyslexia and low-risk controls, this study sets out to answer questions surrounding PA's relationship at various grain sizes (syllable, onset/rime and phoneme) with measures of auditory processing (frequency modulation (FM) and an amplitude rise-time task (RT)) and MA, independent of reading experience. Group analysis revealed significant differences between high- and low-risk children on measures of MA, and PA at all grain sizes, while a trend for lower RT thresholds of high-risk children was found compared with controls. Correlational analysis demonstrated that MA is related to the composite PA score and syllable awareness. Group differences on MA and PA were re-examined including PA and MA, respectively, as control variables. Results exposed PA as a relevant component of MA, independent of reading experience.\n",

We then examine the experiences of medical students who have revealed their dyslexia to illustrate the point that, far too often, attending physicians who know little about dyslexia can misperceive the motives or behavior of students with dyslexia.

      "ABSTRACT Dyslexic Children Show Atypical Cerebellar Activation and Cerebro-Cerebellar Functional Connectivity in Orthographic and Phonological Processing.Previous neuroimaging studies have found atypical cerebellar activation in individuals with dyslexia in either motor-related tasks or language tasks. However, studies investigating atypical cerebellar activation in individuals with dyslexia have mostly used tasks tapping phonological processing. A question that is yet unanswered is whether the cerebellum in individuals with dyslexia functions properly during orthographic processing of words, as growing evidence shows that the cerebellum is also involved in visual and spatial processing. Here, we investigated cerebellar activation and cerebro-cerebellar functional connectivity during word processing in dyslexic readers and typically developing readers using tasks that tap orthographic and phonological codes. In children with dyslexia, we observed an abnormally higher engagement of the bilateral cerebellum for the orthographic task, which was negatively correlated with literacy measures. The greater the reading impairment was for young dyslexic readers, the stronger the cerebellar activation was. This suggests a compensatory role of the cerebellum in reading for children with dyslexia. In addition, a tendency for higher cerebellar activation in dyslexic readers was found in the phonological task. Moreover, the functional connectivity was stronger for dyslexic readers relative to typically developing readers between the lobule VI of the right cerebellum and the left fusiform gyrus during the orthographic task and between the lobule VI of the left cerebellum and the left supramarginal gyrus during the phonological task. This pattern of results suggests that the cerebellum compensates for reading impairment through the connections with specific brain regions responsible for the ongoing reading task. These findings enhance our understanding of the cerebellum's involvement in reading and reading impairment.\n",

Given the absence of relevant studies of Chinese children, the present study tries to investigate these risk factors. A total of 45,850 students were recruited from grades three to six, from seven cities of Hubei province. Dyslexia in Chinese was diagnosed based on children's clinical symptoms. The clinical symptoms of children's reading performance were assessed by Dyslexia Checklist for Chinese Children (DCCC) and Pupil Rating Scale Revised Screening for Learning Disabilities (PRS) which were completed by parent/guardian and header teacher respectively. Chinese language exam was used to screen children with poor reading capacity. Questionnaires about prenatal and perinatal factors were completed by parent or guardian. Among the 34,748 eligible participants, 1,200 (3.45%) were diagnosed with dyslexia in Chinese. More boys suffered from dyslexia than the girls and the gender ratio was 3:1. Family history of neuropsychiatric diseases, maternal infectious diseases, difficult vaginal delivery, preterm birth, and neonatal asphyxia were found to increase the risk of developmental dyslexia in China.

      "ABSTRACT Atypical neural synchronization to speech envelope modulations in dyslexia.A fundamental deficit in the synchronization of neural oscillations to temporal information in speech could underlie phonological processing problems in dyslexia. In this study, the hypothesis of a neural synchronization impairment is investigated more specifically as a function of different neural oscillatory bands and temporal information rates in speech. Auditory steady-state responses to 4, 10, 20 and 40Hz modulations were recorded in normal reading and dyslexic adolescents to measure neural synchronization of theta, alpha, beta and low-gamma oscillations to syllabic and phonemic rate information. In comparison to normal readers, dyslexic readers showed reduced non-synchronized theta activity, reduced synchronized alpha activity and enhanced synchronized beta activity. Positive correlations between alpha synchronization and phonological skills were found in normal readers, but were absent in dyslexic readers. In contrast, dyslexic readers exhibited positive correlations between beta synchronization and phonological skills. Together, these results suggest that auditory neural synchronization of alpha and beta oscillations is atypical in dyslexia, indicating deviant neural processing of both syllabic and phonemic rate information. Impaired synchronization of alpha oscillations in particular demonstrated to be the most prominent neural anomaly possibly hampering speech and phonological processing in dyslexic readers.\n",

Additionally, the striatum has been consistently implicated in ADHD. However, the extent of morphological alterations in the striatum of ADHD/+RD is poorly understood, which is the main purpose of this study. Based on structural MRI images, the surface deformation of the caudate and putamen was assessed in 59 boys matching in age and IQ [19 ADHD/-RD, 15 ADHD/+RD and 25 typically developing controls (TDC)]. A vertex based analysis with multiple comparison correction was conducted to compare ADHD/-RD and ADHD/+RD to TDC. Compared to TDC, ADHD/+RD showed multiple bilateral significant clusters of surface compression. In contrast, ADHD/-RD showed fewer significant clusters of surface compression and restricted to the left side. Regarding the putamen, only ADHD/-RD showed significant clusters of surface compression. Results demonstrate for the first time a greater extent of morphological alterations in the caudate of ADHD/+RD than ADHD/-RD compared to TDC, which may suggest greater implicated cortical areas projecting to the caudate that are associated with the greater neuropsychological impairments observed in ADHD/+RD.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The roles of cognitive and language abilities in predicting decoding and reading comprehension: comparisons of dyslexia and specific language impairment.This study aimed to (a) explore the roles of cognitive and language variables in predicting reading abilities of two groups of individuals with reading disabilities (i.e., dyslexia and specific language impairment) and (b) examine which variable(s) is the most predictive in differentiating two groups. Inclusion/exclusion criteria applied to categorize the two groups yielded a total of 63 participants (n = 44 for the dyslexia; n = 19 for the specific language impairment). A stepwise multiple regression approach was conducted to examine which cognitive and/or language variables made the largest contribution to reading abilities (i.e., Phonetic Decoding Efficiency, Word Attack, Sight Word Efficiency, and Passage Comprehension). Results revealed that there were significant differences in which measures of cognitive and language ability predicted individuals with dyslexia and speech and language impairments reading ability, showing that the cognitive and language variables underlying their difficulty with reading abilities were not the same across the two groups. A discriminant function analysis showed that a measure of Verbal Comprehension, Phonological Awareness, and Phonetic Decoding Efficiency can be used to differentiate the two groups. These findings support the tenet that dyslexia and specific language impairment are two subgroups of reading disabilities and that thorough diagnostic evaluations are needed to differentiate between these two subgroups. Distinctions of this nature are central to determining the type and intensity of language-based interventions.\n",

      "ABSTRACT A sequence learning impairment in dyslexia? It depends on the task.Language acquisition is argued to be dependent upon an individuals' sensitivity to serial-order regularities in the environment (sequential learning), and impairments in reading and spelling in dyslexia have recently been attributed to a deficit in sequential learning. The present study examined the learning and consolidation of sequential knowledge in 30 adults with dyslexia and 29 typical adults matched on age and nonverbal ability using two tasks previously reported to be sensitive to a sequence learning deficit. Both groups showed evidence of sequential learning and consolidation on a serial response time (SRT) task (i.e., faster and more accurate responses to sequenced spatial locations than randomly ordered spatial locations during training that persisted one week later). Whilst typical adults showed evidence of sequential learning on a Hebb repetition task (i.e., more accurate serial recall of repetitive sequences of nonwords versus randomly ordered sequences), adults with dyslexia showed initial advantages for repetitive versus randomly ordered sequences in the first half of training trials, but this effect disappeared in the second half of trials. This Hebb repetition effect was positively correlated with spelling in the dyslexic group; however, there was no correlation between sequential learning on the two tasks, placing doubt over whether sequential learning in different modalities represents a single capacity. These data suggest that sequential learning difficulties in adults with dyslexia are not ubiquitous, and when present may be a consequence of task demands rather than sequence learning per se.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Neural signatures of phonological deficits in Chinese developmental dyslexia.There has been debate on whether phonological deficits explain reading difficulty in Chinese, since Chinese is a logographic language which does not employ grapheme-phoneme-correspondence rules and remote memorization seems to be the main method to acquire reading. In the current study, we present neuroimaging evidence that the phonological deficit is also a signature of Chinese dyslexia. Specifically, we found that Chinese children with dyslexia (DD) showed reduced brain activation in the left dorsal inferior frontal gyrus (dIFG) when compared to both age-matched controls (AC) and reading-matched controls (RC) during an auditory rhyming judgment task. This suggests that the phonological processing deficit in this region may be a signature of dyslexia in Chinese, rather than a difference due to task performance or reading ability, which was matched on DD and RC. At exactly the same region of the left dIFG, we found a positive correlation between brain activation and reading skill in DD, suggesting that the phonological deficit is associated with the severity of dyslexia. We also found increased brain activation in the right precentral gyrus in DD than both AC and RC, suggesting a compensation of reliance on articulation. Functional connectivity analyses revealed that DD had a weaker connection between the left superior temporal gyrus (STG) and fusiform gyrus (FG) than the two control groups, suggesting that the reduced connection between phonology and orthography is another neural signature of dyslexia. In contrast, DD showed greater connectivity between the left dIFG and the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL) than both control groups, suggesting a reduced segregation between the language network and default mode network in dyslexic children. We also found that connectivity between the left STG and the left dIFG was sensitive to task performance and/or reading skill rather than being dyslexic or not, because AC was greater than both RC and DD, while the connectivity between the left middle occipital gyrus (MOG) and left STG was sensitive to age, because both AC and DD were greater than RC. In summary, our study provides the very first neurological evidence of phonological deficits in Chinese developmental dyslexia and we successfully distinguished variations of brain activity/functional connectivity due to age, performance, and dyslexia by comparing AC, RC, and DD.\n",

      "ABSTRACT A Review about Functional Illiteracy: Definition, Cognitive, Linguistic, and Numerical Aspects.Formally, availability of education for children has increased around the world over the last decades. However, despite having a successful formal education career, adults can become functional illiterates. Functional illiteracy means that a person cannot use reading, writing, and calculation skills for his/her own and the community's development. Functional illiteracy has considerable negative effects not only on personal development, but also in economic and social terms. Although functional illiteracy has been highly publicized in mass media in the recent years, there is limited scientific knowledge about the people termed functional illiterates; definition, assessment, and differential diagnoses with respect to related numerical and linguistic impairments are rarely studied and controversial. The first goal of our review is to give a comprehensive overview of the research on functional illiteracy by describing gaps in knowledge within the field and to outline and address the basic questions concerning who can be considered as functional illiterates: (1) Do they possess basic skills? (2) In which abilities do they have the largest deficits? (3) Are numerical and linguistic deficits related? (4) What is the fundamental reason for their difficulties? (5) Are there main differences between functional illiterates, illiterates, and dyslexics? We will see that despite partial evidence, there is still much research needed to answer these questions. Secondly, we emphasize the timeliness for a new and more precise definition that results in uniform sampling, better diagnosis, conclusion, and intervention. We propose the following working definition as the result of the review: functional illiteracy is the incapability to understand complex texts despite adequate schooling, age, language skills, elementary reading skills, and IQ. These inabilities must also not be fully explained by sensory, domain-general cognitive, neurological or mental disorders. In sum, we suggest that functional illiteracy must be more thoroughly understood and assessed from a theoretical, empirical, and diagnostic perspective.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The Effect of Illustration on Improving Text Comprehension in Dyslexic Adults.This study analyses the effect of pictures in reading materials on the viewing patterns of dyslexic adults. By analysing viewing patterns using eye-tracking, we captured differences in eye movements between young adults with dyslexia and controls based on the influence of reading skill as a continuous variable of the total sample. Both types of participants were assigned randomly to view either text-only or a text + picture stimuli. The results show that the controls made an early global overview of the material and (when a picture was present) rapid transitions between text and picture. Having text illustrated with a picture decreased scores on questions about the learning material among participants with dyslexia. Controls spent 1.7% and dyslexic participants 1% of their time on the picture. Controls had 24% fewer total fixations; however, 29% more of the control group's fixations than the dyslexic group's fixations were on the picture. We also looked for effects of different types of pictures. Dyslexic subjects exhibited a comparable viewing pattern to controls when scenes were complex, but fewer fixations when scenes were neutral/simple. Individual scan paths are presented as examples of atypical viewing patterns for individuals with dyslexia as compared with controls. © 2016 The Authors.

This situation is of concern for modern societies that value social justice. This study was designed to explore learning experiences of university students with dyslexia and factors that could contribute to their success. Thirteen students with dyslexia and 20 non-dyslexic peers were interviewed about their university learning experiences using a semi-structured qualitative approach. Students with dyslexia described engaging in learning activities intensively, frequently and strategically. They reported challenges and strengths relating to study skills, lectures, assessments, technology and support services. They also described helpful strategies including self-directed adaptive techniques, provisions from lecturers and assistance from the university. These findings suggest that students with dyslexia experience broad challenges at university, but helpful strategies may be available. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Combined Modality Intervention for ADHD With Comorbid Reading Disorders: A Proof of Concept Study.To evaluate the relative efficacy of two reading programs with and without adjunctive stimulant medication for children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and comorbid reading disorder (ADHD+RD). Sixty-five children (7-11 years in age) were assigned randomly to one of three intensive remedial academic programs (phonologically or strategy-based reading instruction, or general academic strategy and social skills training) in combination with either immediate-release methylphenidate or placebo. Multiple-blind procedures were used for medication/placebo, given twice daily. Children received 35 hours of instruction in 10 weeks, taught by a trained teacher in a separate school classroom, in small matched groups of 2 to 3. Children's behavior and reading abilities were assessed before and after intervention. Stimulant medication produced expected beneficial effects on hyperactive/impulsive behavioral symptoms (reported by classroom teachers) but none on reading. Children receiving a reading program showed greater gains than controls on multiple standardized measures of reading and related skills (regardless of medication status). Small sample sizes precluded interpretation of possible potentiating effects of stimulant medication on reading skills taught in particular reading programs. Intensive reading instruction, regardless of treatment with stimulant medication, may be efficacious in improving reading problems in children with ADHD+RD and warrants further investigation in a large-scale study.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Beyond Phonology: Visual Processes Predict Alphanumeric and Nonalphanumeric Rapid Naming in Poor Early Readers.Visual processes in Grade 1 were examined for their predictive influences in nonalphanumeric and alphanumeric rapid naming (RAN) in 51 poor early and 69 typical readers. In a lagged design, children were followed longitudinally from Grade 1 to Grade 3 over 5 testing occasions. RAN outcomes in early Grade 2 were predicted by speeded and nonspeeded visual processing measures, after controlling for initial (Grade 1) RAN, matrix reasoning, phonological awareness, and word decoding abilities. A predictive influence of backward visual masking-a speeded visual discrimination task-was found for nonalphanumeric RAN in early Grade 2 but not for alphanumeric RAN or subsequent RAN ability in Grades 2 and 3. A nonspeeded predictor involving controlled visual attention accounted for significant variance in early Grade 2 RAN in the poor early reader group. Results are discussed in relation to Wolf, Bowers, and Biddle's conceptualization of rapid naming-in particular, on the roles of visual processes in speeded low and nonspeeded high spatial frequency visual information in predicting RAN.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Altered patterns of directed connectivity within the reading network of dyslexic children and their relation to reading dysfluency.Reading is a complex cognitive skill subserved by a distributed network of visual and language-related regions. Disruptions of connectivity within this network have been associated with developmental dyslexia but their relation to individual differences in the severity of reading problems remains unclear. Here we investigate whether dysfunctional connectivity scales with the level of reading dysfluency by examining EEG recordings during visual word and false font processing in 9-year-old typically reading children (TR) and two groups of dyslexic children: severely dysfluent (SDD) and moderately dysfluent (MDD) dyslexics. Results indicated weaker occipital to inferior-temporal connectivity for words in both dyslexic groups relative to TRs. Furthermore, SDDs exhibited stronger connectivity from left central to right inferior-temporal and occipital sites for words relative to TRs, and for false fonts relative to both MDDs and TRs. Importantly, reading fluency was positively related with forward and negatively with backward connectivity. Our results suggest disrupted visual processing of words in both dyslexic groups, together with a compensatory recruitment of right posterior brain regions especially in the SDDs during word and false font processing. Functional connectivity in the brain's reading network may thus depend on the level of reading dysfluency beyond group differences between dyslexic and typical readers.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Screening for Dyslexia Using Eye Tracking during Reading.Dyslexia is a neurodevelopmental reading disability estimated to affect 5-10% of the population. While there is yet no full understanding of the cause of dyslexia, or agreement on its precise definition, it is certain that many individuals suffer persistent problems in learning to read for no apparent reason. Although it is generally agreed that early intervention is the best form of support for children with dyslexia, there is still a lack of efficient and objective means to help identify those at risk during the early years of school. Here we show that it is possible to identify 9-10 year old individuals at risk of persistent reading difficulties by using eye tracking during reading to probe the processes that underlie reading ability. In contrast to current screening methods, which rely on oral or written tests, eye tracking does not depend on the subject to produce some overt verbal response and thus provides a natural means to objectively assess the reading process as it unfolds in real-time. Our study is based on a sample of 97 high-risk subjects with early identified word decoding difficulties and a control group of 88 low-risk subjects. These subjects were selected from a larger population of 2165 school children attending second grade. Using predictive modeling and statistical resampling techniques, we develop classification models from eye tracking records less than one minute in duration and show that the models are able to differentiate high-risk subjects from low-risk subjects with high accuracy. Although dyslexia is fundamentally a language-based learning disability, our results suggest that eye movements in reading can be highly predictive of individual reading ability and that eye tracking can be an efficient means to identify children at risk of long-term reading difficulties.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Temporal Processing Development in Chinese Primary School-Aged Children With Dyslexia.This study aimed to investigate the development of visual and auditory temporal processing among children with and without dyslexia and to examine the roles of temporal processing in reading and reading-related abilities. A total of 362 Chinese children in Grades 1-6 were recruited from Taiwan. Half of the children had dyslexia, and the other half were typically developing children who matched the dyslexic group on age, intelligence, and gender. Our results indicate that for typically developing children, the visual and auditory modalities follow the same developmental trend: The children in first and second grades performed significantly worse than the older children. Among the children with dyslexia, however, significant improvements in the visual modality were observed with increasing age. Furthermore, although both modalities were important for all reading-related abilities and for Chinese character reading in first and second grades, the visual modality significantly predicted only orthographic knowledge and Chinese character reading in third and fourth grades. In contrast, the auditory modality affected only phonological awareness. In fifth and sixth grades, only visual temporal processing slightly contributed to the orthographic knowledge and Chinese character reading of the dyslexic group. Also, the relationship between temporal processing and Chinese character reading is strongly influenced by age.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Advances in Dyslexia Genetics-New Insights Into the Role of Brain Asymmetries.Dyslexia is a common condition affecting up to 10% school-aged children. There is strong evidence that genetics plays an important role in dyslexia and is expected to be complex in nature. Few specific susceptibility factors have been identified so far, but their functional characterization has provided novel insights into the biology of dyslexia. In particular, they point to an unexpected role of candidate genes for dyslexia in the biology of cilia, cellular organelles required in many processes including the establishment of left-right asymmetries early in development. This observation has brought back into the spotlight the old idea of a link between dyslexia and handedness. Yet much of the genetics contributing to dyslexia remains unexplained. The lack of biological markers, clear diagnostic criteria, and homogeneous assessment strategies are just some of the factors preventing the collection of the cohorts powered enough for large-scale genetic studies. While the technology and methods to generate and handle large-scale data have reached unprecedented potential, the main challenge remains in establishing universal guidelines to collect suitable phenotype information across independent studies. These difficulties reflect the complex nature of dyslexia which is highly heterogeneous and often co-occurs with other neurodevelopmental disorders.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Comprehension and Generation of Metaphoric Language in Children, Adolescents, and Adults with Dyslexia.Difficulties with figurative language comprehension were documented in adult dyslexia (DYS). In the present research, we investigated the comprehension and generation of metaphors in 37 children, 35 adolescents, and 34 adults with and without DYS. We also tested the contribution of executive function to metaphor processing. A multiple-choice questionnaire with conventional and novel metaphors was used to assess comprehension; a concept-explanation task was used to test conventional and novel metaphor generation (verbal creativity). The findings indicated differences between the dyslexic children and the control group in conventional metaphor comprehension. However, both groups performed similarly in the novel metaphor comprehension test. Furthermore, although children and adolescents with DYS showed similar performance in metaphor generation as their typically developing peers, adults with DYS generated more metaphors than controls. While scores on tests of verbal knowledge and mental flexibility contributed to the prediction of conventional metaphor comprehension, scores on non-verbal tests and mental flexibility contributed to the prediction of novel metaphor generation. Our findings suggest that individuals with DYS are not impaired in novel metaphor comprehension and metaphor generation and that metaphor comprehension and generation utilize different cognitive resources.

      "ABSTRACT Dysfunction of Rapid Neural Adaptation in Dyslexia.Identification of specific neurophysiological dysfunctions resulting in selective reading difficulty (dyslexia) has remained elusive. In addition to impaired reading development, individuals with dyslexia frequently exhibit behavioral deficits in perceptual adaptation. Here, we assessed neurophysiological adaptation to stimulus repetition in adults and children with dyslexia for a wide variety of stimuli, spoken words, written words, visual objects, and faces. For every stimulus type, individuals with dyslexia exhibited significantly diminished neural adaptation compared to controls in stimulus-specific cortical areas. Better reading skills in adults and children with dyslexia were associated with greater repetition-induced neural adaptation. These results highlight a dysfunction of rapid neural adaptation as a core neurophysiological difference in dyslexia that may underlie impaired reading development. Reduced neurophysiological adaptation may relate to prior reports of reduced behavioral adaptation in dyslexia and may reveal a difference in brain functions that ultimately results in a specific reading impairment.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Phonological abilities in literacy-impaired children: Brain potentials reveal deficient phoneme discrimination, but intact prosodic processing.Intact phonological processing is crucial for successful literacy acquisition. While individuals with difficulties in reading and spelling (i.e., developmental dyslexia) are known to experience deficient phoneme discrimination (i.e., segmental phonology), findings concerning their prosodic processing (i.e., suprasegmental phonology) are controversial. Because there are no behavior-independent studies on the underlying neural correlates of prosodic processing in dyslexia, these controversial findings might be explained by different task demands. To provide an objective behavior-independent picture of segmental and suprasegmental phonological processing in impaired literacy acquisition, we investigated event-related brain potentials during passive listening in typically and poor-spelling German school children. For segmental phonology, we analyzed the Mismatch Negativity (MMN) during vowel length discrimination, capturing automatic auditory deviancy detection in repetitive contexts. For suprasegmental phonology, we analyzed the Closure Positive Shift (CPS) that automatically occurs in response to prosodic boundaries. Our results revealed spelling group differences for the MMN, but not for the CPS, indicating deficient segmental, but intact suprasegmental phonological processing in poor spellers. The present findings point towards a differential role of segmental and suprasegmental phonology in literacy disorders and call for interventions that invigorate impaired literacy by utilizing intact prosody in addition to training deficient phonemic awareness.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Neurogenetics of developmental dyslexia: from genes to behavior through brain neuroimaging and cognitive and sensorial mechanisms.Developmental dyslexia (DD) is a complex neurodevelopmental deficit characterized by impaired reading acquisition, in spite of adequate neurological and sensorial conditions, educational opportunities and normal intelligence. Despite the successful characterization of DD-susceptibility genes, we are far from understanding the molecular etiological pathways underlying the development of reading (dis)ability. By focusing mainly on clinical phenotypes, the molecular genetics approach has yielded mixed results. More optimally reduced measures of functioning, that is, intermediate phenotypes (IPs), represent a target for researching disease-associated genetic variants and for elucidating the underlying mechanisms. Imaging data provide a viable IP for complex neurobehavioral disorders and have been extensively used to investigate both morphological, structural and functional brain abnormalities in DD. Performing joint genetic and neuroimaging studies in humans is an emerging strategy to link DD-candidate genes to the brain structure and function. A limited number of studies has already pursued the imaging-genetics integration in DD. However, the results are still not sufficient to unravel the complexity of the reading circuit due to heterogeneous study design and data processing. Here, we propose an interdisciplinary, multilevel, imaging-genetic approach to disentangle the pathways from genes to behavior. As the presence of putative functional genetic variants has been provided and as genetic associations with specific cognitive/sensorial mechanisms have been reported, new hypothesis-driven imaging-genetic studies must gain momentum. This approach would lead to the optimization of diagnostic criteria and to the early identification of 'biologically at-risk' children, supporting the definition of adequate and well-timed prevention strategies and the implementation of novel, specific remediation approach.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Formation of Orthographic Representations in Spanish Dyslexic Children: The Role of Syllable Complexity and Frequency.Recent studies have suggested that Spanish children with dyslexia have difficulty storing orthographic representations of new words. But given that the syllable plays an important role in word recognition in Spanish, it is possible that the formation of orthographic representations is influenced by the characteristics of the syllables that make up the words. The objective of this study was to determine whether syllabic frequency and syllabic complexity influence orthographic learning in children with dyslexia. We compared the performance of a group of dyslexic children with that of a group of typical readers on a task that involved reading short and long pseudowords six times; we manipulated the frequency and complexity of the syllables from which the pseudowords were constructed. The results showed that dyslexic children do not benefit from syllabic simplicity or frequency when it comes to storing orthographic representations as the length effect in the dyslexic group remained was unchanged after repeated readings, regardless of stimulus characteristics.

      "ABSTRACT The 1-min Screening Test for Reading Problems in College Students: Psychometric Properties of the 1-min TIL.Reading is a central cognitive domain, but little research has been devoted to standardized tests for adults. We, thus, examined the psychometric properties of the 1-min version of Teste de Idade de Leitura (Reading Age Test; 1-min TIL), the Portuguese version of Lobrot L3 test, in three experiments with college students: typical readers in Experiment 1A and B, dyslexic readers and chronological age controls in Experiment 2. In Experiment 1A, test-retest reliability and convergent validity were evaluated in 185 students. Reliability was >.70, and phonological decoding underpinned 1-min TIL. In Experiment 1B, internal consistency was assessed by presenting two 45-s versions of the test to 19 students, and performance in these versions was significantly associated (r = .78). In Experiment 2, construct validity, criterion validity and clinical utility of 1-min TIL were investigated. A multiple regression analysis corroborated construct validity; both phonological decoding and listening comprehension were reliable predictors of 1-min TIL scores. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristics analyses revealed the high accuracy of this test in distinguishing dyslexic from typical readers. Therefore, the 1-min TIL, which assesses reading comprehension and potential reading difficulties in college students, has the necessary psychometric properties to become a useful screening instrument in neuropsychological assessment and research.

      "ABSTRACT Association analysis of dyslexia candidate genes in a Dutch longitudinal sample.Dyslexia is a common specific learning disability with a substantive genetic component. Several candidate genes have been proposed to be implicated in dyslexia susceptibility, such as DYX1C1, ROBO1, KIAA0319, and DCDC2. Associations with variants in these genes have also been reported with a variety of psychometric measures tapping into the underlying processes that might be impaired in dyslexic people. In this study, we first conducted a literature review to select single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in dyslexia candidate genes that had been repeatedly implicated across studies. We then assessed the SNPs for association in the richly phenotyped longitudinal data set from the Dutch Dyslexia Program. We tested for association with several quantitative traits, including word and nonword reading fluency, rapid naming, phoneme deletion, and nonword repetition. In this, we took advantage of the longitudinal nature of the sample to examine if associations were stable across four educational time-points (from 7 to 12 years). Two SNPs in the KIAA0319 gene were nominally associated with rapid naming, and these associations were stable across different ages. Genetic association analysis with complex cognitive traits can be enriched through the use of longitudinal information on trait development.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Exploring Text and Icon Graph Interpretation in Students with Dyslexia: An Eye-tracking Study.A growing body of research suggests that individuals with dyslexia struggle to use graphs efficiently. Given the persistence of orthographic processing deficits in dyslexia, this study tested whether graph interpretation deficits in dyslexia are directly related to difficulties processing the orthographic components of graphs (i.e. axes and legend labels). Participants were 80 college students with and without dyslexia. Response times and eye movements were recorded as students answered comprehension questions about simple data displayed in bar graphs. Axes and legends were labelled either with words (mixed-modality graphs) or icons (orthography-free graphs). Students also answered informationally equivalent questions presented in sentences (orthography-only condition). Response times were slower in the dyslexic group only for processing sentences. However, eye tracking data revealed group differences for processing mixed-modality graphs, whereas no group differences were found for the orthography-free graphs. When processing bar graphs, students with dyslexia differ from their able reading peers only when graphs contain orthographic features. Implications for processing informational text are discussed.

We review findings from associative learning studies on related cognitive skills important for establishing and consolidating L-SS associations. Then we review brain potential studies, including our own, that yielded two markers associated with reading fluency. Here we show that the marker related to visual specialization (N170) predicts word and pseudoword reading fluency in children who received additional practice in the processing of morphological word structure. Conversely, L-SS integration (indexed by mismatch negativity (MMN)) may only remain important when direct orthography to semantic conversion is not possible, such as in pseudoword reading. In addition, the correlation between these two markers supports the notion that multisensory integration facilitates visual specialization. Finally, we review the role of implicit learning and executive functions in audiovisual learning in dyslexia. Implications for remedial research are discussed and suggestions for future studies are presented.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Dyslexics' faster decay of implicit memory for sounds and words is manifested in their shorter neural adaptation.Dyslexia is a prevalent reading disability whose underlying mechanisms are still disputed. We studied the neural mechanisms underlying dyslexia using a simple frequency-discrimination task. Though participants were asked to compare the two tones in each trial, implicit memory of previous trials affected their responses. We hypothesized that implicit memory decays faster among dyslexics. We tested this by increasing the temporal intervals between consecutive trials, and by measuring the behavioral impact and ERP responses from the auditory cortex. Dyslexics showed a faster decay of implicit memory effects on both measures, with similar time constants. Finally, faster decay of implicit memory also characterized the impact of sound regularities in benefitting dyslexics' oral reading rate. Their benefit decreased faster as a function of the time interval from the previous reading of the same non-word. We propose that dyslexics' shorter neural adaptation paradoxically accounts for their longer reading times, since it reduces their temporal window of integration of past stimuli, resulting in noisier and less reliable predictions for both simple and complex stimuli. Less reliable predictions limit their acquisition of reading expertise.\n",

A pretest-posttest quasi-experimental study was conducted. The statistical population of this study was 7- to 10-year-old dyslexic children referring to two centres of learning disorder in the city of Isfahan. Twenty two of these children were selected using available and purposive sampling from the statistical population and were randomly assigned into two groups of experimental and control. The former (experimental group) participated in sports vision exercise courses for 12 weeks (3 one hr sessions per week) and the latter (control group) continued their routine daily activities during the exercise. Before the beginning and at the end of the exercise, Gardner's test of visual perception test - revised and Dehkhoda's reading skills test was administered to both groups. The results showed that the sports vision exercises increases motor skills, visual perceptual skills and reading skills in developmental dyslexic children. Based on the results of the presented study it was concluded that sports vision exercises can be used for fundamental and cognitive skills of developmental dyslexic children.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Spelling and Morphology in Dyslexia: A Developmental Study Across the School Years.The current study examined the effect of morphological knowledge on spelling development in Hebrew-speaking schoolchildren, adolescents and adults with dyslexia, compared with typically developing (TD) peers. Participants were 238 Hebrew-speaking readers of five grade levels of whom 139 were TD and 99 had developmental dyslexia (DD). Participants were tested on a function letter spelling task, a phonological awareness task and a morphological awareness task. The overall picture that emerged from the results is that performance on all measures increased with grade level, with TD participants always scoring higher than peers with DD. Moreover, the higher the morphological complexity in spelling and irregularity in noun inflection, the higher the differences between the DD and TD participants. Finally, performance on the morphological awareness task contributed to spelling morphologically more complex spelling items in the TD, but not in the DD group. From clinical and educational perspectives, these results strongly suggest that rigorous morphological instruction is necessary in teaching children and adolescents with dyslexia to identify and use morphological cues in spoken and written Hebrew.

Analyses identified connectivity within and across adjacent levels (units) of language in reading: from subword to word to syntax in Set I and from word to syntax to multi-sentence in Set II). Typicals were compared to (a) students with dyslexia (6 girls, 10 boys) on the subword and word tasks in Set I related to levels of language impaired in dyslexia, and (b) students with oral and written language learning disability (OWL LD) (3 girls, 2 boys) on the morphology and syntax tasks in Set II, related to levels of language impaired in OWL LD. Results for typical language learners showed that adjacent levels of language in the reading brain share common and unique connectivity. The dyslexia group showed over-connectivity to a greater degree on the imaging tasks related to their levels of language impairments than the OWL LD group who showed under-connectivity to a greater degree than did the dyslexia group on the imaging tasks related to their levels of language impairment. Results for these students in grades 4 to 9 (ages 9 to 14) are discussed in reference to the contribution of patterns of connectivity across levels of language to understanding the nature of persisting dyslexia and dysgraphia despite early intervention.\n",

We apply the new model to a resting-state fMRI study to compare the functional connectivity networks in both typical and reading impaired young adults in order to characterize the resting state networks that are related to reading processes. We also compare the performance of our model to other methods of statistical inference on functional connectivity networks that do not account for the temporal autocorrelation or heterogeneity across the subjects using simulated data, and show that by accounting for these sources of variation and covariation results in more powerful tests for statistical inference.\n",

To date, however, the phonological deficits involved in schizophrenia in Chinese and its neural basis have not been well established. In order to establish such a relationship we conducted a behavioral study using lexical tone judgment and digit span tasks as well as an event-related potential (ERP) study with an auditory oddball paradigm, in particular, for P300 effects, the event-related brain potential (ERP) index of discrimination. Chinese patients with schizophrenia and Chinese healthy controls in China participated in the current study. Compared to the healthy controls, the patients with schizophrenia showed significant impairments in phonological processing skills, which in turn significantly correlated with smaller P300 effects. Thus these behavioral and electrophysiological findings in Chinese patients with schizophrenia were critically evaluated in terms of their phonological processing abilities.\n",

Bilinguals were not expected to fail in English measures, and their gap with monolinguals would be expected to be limited to the instructional language, owing to underexposure. All participants were enrolled in Italian primary schools (fourth and fifth grades). A non-verbal reasoning task and Italian and English literacy tasks were administered. The Italian battery included word and non-word reading (speed and accuracy), word and non-word writing, and reading comprehension; the English battery included similar tasks, except for the non-word writing. Bilingual children performed similarly to typical readers in English tasks, whereas in Italian tasks, their performance was similar to that of typical readers in reading speed but not in reading accuracy and writing. Children with dyslexia underperformed compared with typically developing children in all English and Italian tasks, except for reading comprehension in Italian. Profile analysis and correlational analyses were further discussed. These results suggest that English as a foreign language might represent a challenge for students with dyslexia but a strength for bilingual language-minority children.

The present study assessed whether morphemes affect (1) younger children, with and without dyslexia; (2) spelling as well as reading; and (3) words with low-frequency morphemes. Two groups of third graders (16 children with dyslexia and dysorthography and 16 age-matched typically developing children) read aloud and spelt to dictation pseudowords and words. Pseudowords included (1) root + suffix in not existing combinations (e.g. lampadista, formed by lampad-, 'lamp', and -ista, '-ist') and (2) orthographic sequences not corresponding to any Italian root or suffix (e.g. livonosto). Words had low frequency and included: (1) root + suffix, both of high frequency (e.g. bestiale, 'beastly'); (2) root + suffix, both of low frequency (e.g. asprigno, 'rather sour'); and (3) simple words (e.g. insulso, 'vapid'). Children with dyslexia and dysorthography were less accurate than typically developing children. Root + suffix pseudowords were read and spelt more accurately than non-morphological pseudowords by both groups. Morphologically complex (root + suffix) words were read and spelt better than simple words. However, task interacted with morphology: reading was not facilitated by low-frequency morphemes. We conclude that children acquiring a transparent orthography exploit morpheme-based reading and spelling to face difficulties in processing long unfamiliar stimuli.

      "ABSTRACT Dyslexia risk gene relates to representation of sound in the auditory brainstem.Dyslexia is a reading disorder with strong associations with KIAA0319 and DCDC2. Both genes play a functional role in spike time precision of neurons. Strikingly, poor readers show an imprecise encoding of fast transients of speech in the auditory brainstem. Whether dyslexia risk genes are related to the quality of sound encoding in the auditory brainstem remains to be investigated. Here, we quantified the response consistency of speech-evoked brainstem responses to the acoustically presented syllable [da] in 159 genotyped, literate and preliterate children. When controlling for age, sex, familial risk and intelligence, partial correlation analyses associated a higher dyslexia risk loading with KIAA0319 with noisier responses. In contrast, a higher risk loading with DCDC2 was associated with a trend towards more stable responses. These results suggest that unstable representation of sound, and thus, reduced neural discrimination ability of stop consonants, occurred in genotypes carrying a higher amount of KIAA0319 risk alleles. Current data provide the first evidence that the dyslexia-associated gene KIAA0319 can alter brainstem responses and impair phoneme processing in the auditory brainstem. This brain-gene relationship provides insight into the complex relationships between phenotype and genotype thereby improving the understanding of the dyslexia-inherent complex multifactorial condition.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Sequential Prediction of Literacy Achievement for Specific Learning Disabilities Contrasting in Impaired Levels of Language in Grades 4 to 9.Sequential regression was used to evaluate whether language-related working memory components uniquely predict reading and writing achievement beyond cognitive-linguistic translation for students in Grades 4 through 9 ( N = 103) with specific learning disabilities (SLDs) in subword handwriting (dysgraphia, n = 25), word reading and spelling (dyslexia, n = 60), or oral and written language (oral and written language learning disabilities, n = 18). That is, SLDs are defined on the basis of cascading level of language impairment (subword, word, and syntax/text). A five-block regression model sequentially predicted literacy achievement from cognitive-linguistic translation (Block 1); working memory components for word-form coding (Block 2), phonological and orthographic loops (Block 3), and supervisory focused or switching attention (Block 4); and SLD groups (Block 5). Results showed that cognitive-linguistic translation explained an average of 27% and 15% of the variance in reading and writing achievement, respectively, but working memory components explained an additional 39% and 27% of variance. Orthographic word-form coding uniquely predicted nearly every measure, whereas attention switching uniquely predicted only reading. Finally, differences in reading and writing persisted between dyslexia and dysgraphia, with dysgraphia higher, even after controlling for Block 1 to 4 predictors. Differences in literacy achievement between students with dyslexia and oral and written language learning disabilities were largely explained by the Block 1 predictors. Applications to identifying and teaching students with these SLDs are discussed.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Genes, Gender, Environment, and Novel Functions of Estrogen Receptor Beta in the Susceptibility to Neurodevelopmental Disorders.Many neurological disorders affect men and women differently regarding prevalence, progression, and severity. It is clear that many of these disorders may originate from defective signaling during fetal or perinatal brain development, which may affect males and females differently. Such sex-specific differences may originate from chromosomal or sex-hormone specific effects. This short review will focus on the estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) signaling during perinatal brain development and put it in the context of sex-specific differences in neurodevelopmental disorders. We will discuss ERβ's recent discovery in directing DNA de-methylation to specific sites, of which one such site may bear consequences for the susceptibility to the neurological reading disorder dyslexia. We will also discuss how dysregulations in sex-hormone signaling, like those evoked by endocrine disruptive chemicals, may affect this and other neurodevelopmental disorders in a sex-specific manner through ERβ.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The impact of multisensory instruction on learning letter names and sounds, word reading, and spelling.The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the use of simultaneous multisensory structured language instruction promoted better letter name and sound production, word reading, and word spelling for second grade children with typical development (N = 6) or with dyslexia (N = 5) than structured language instruction alone. The use of non-English graphemes (letters) to represent two pretend languages was used to control for children's lexical knowledge. A multiple baseline, multiple probe across subjects single-case design, with an embedded alternating treatments design, was used to compare the efficacy of multisensory and structured language interventions. Both interventions provided explicit systematic phonics instruction; however, the multisensory intervention also utilized simultaneous engagement of at least two sensory modalities (visual, auditory, and kinesthetic/tactile). Participant's graphed data was visually analyzed, and individual Tau-U and weighted Tau-U effect sizes were calculated for the outcome variables of letter name production, letter sound production, word reading, and word spelling. The multisensory intervention did not provide an advantage over the structured intervention for participants with typical development or dyslexia. However, both interventions had an overall treatment effect for participants with typical development and dyslexia, although intervention effects varied by outcome variable.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Mirrors are hard to break: A critical review and behavioral evidence on mirror-image processing in developmental dyslexia.The relation between reversal errors (e.g., d for b, Я for R) and developmental dyslexia has been elusive. In this study, we investigated the roles of reading level, visual category, and orientation processing in this relation. Children with developmental dyslexia, chronological-age-matched controls, and reading-level-matched controls performed two \"same-different\" matching tasks on reversible (e.g., b) and nonreversible (e.g., e) letters and on geometric shapes (e.g., ). In the orientation-based task, orientation processing was explicitly required; in the shape-based task, orientation processing would be automatic inasmuch as it was task irrelevant and would hinder successful performance. Two orientation contrasts were examined: mirror images (e.g., d-b) and plane rotations (e.g., d-p). For the latter, dyslexics behaved as controls; all were worse on shape-based judgments of plane rotation than on identical (e.g., d-d) pairs and were better able to attend to orientation than to shape. In contrast, for mirror images and across visual categories, dyslexics showed an advantage over typical readers on shape-based judgments. Both control groups had worse performance on shape-based judgments of mirror images than of identical pairs and exhibited similar magnitudes of mirror interference. Dyslexic children were the only group whose shape-based judgments were immune to mirror-image differences because they failed to automatize mirror discrimination during visual object processing. This deficit is not a consequence of reading level, is found across visual categories, and is specific to mirror images.\n",

      "ABSTRACT A Psychometric Tool for a Virtual Reality Rehabilitation Approach for Dyslexia.Dyslexia is a chronic problem that affects the life of subjects and often influences their life choices. The standard rehabilitation methods all use a classic paper and pencil training format but these exercises are boring and demanding for children who may have difficulty in completing the treatments. It is important to develop a new rehabilitation program that would help children in a funny and engaging way. A Wii-based game was developed to demonstrate that a short treatment with an action video game, rather than phonological or orthographic training, may improve the reading abilities in dyslexic children. According to the results, an approach using cues in the context of a virtual environment may represent a promising tool to improve attentional skills. On the other hand, our results do not demonstrate an immediate effect on reading performance, suggesting that a more prolonged protocol may be a future direction.\n",

Our results indicate that children with dyslexia perform less well than TD children in most of the tasks measuring pragmatics of language, and in one of the tasks measuring ToM. In contrast, children with NLD generally performed better than the dyslexia group, and performed significantly worse than the TD children only in a metaphors task based on visual stimuli. A discriminant function analysis confirmed the crucial role of the metaphors subtest and the verbal ToM task in distinguishing between the groups. We concluded that, contrary to a generally-held assumption, children with dyslexia and associated language difficulties may be weaker than children with NLD in linguistic pragmatics and ToM, especially when language is crucially involved.

      "ABSTRACT Differences in dyslexic students before and after a remediation program: A clinical neuropsychological and event related potential study.Developmental dyslexia is defined as an unexpected specific and persistent failure to acquire efficient reading skills despite conventional instruction, adequate intelligence and sociocultural opportunity. This article reports the outcomes of a study that evaluated the implementation of a 4-month intervention program. The intervention consisted of structured activities aiming at improving (a) the children's phonological awareness, (b) their visual and auditory memory, (c) their visual discrimination ability, and (d) their text comprehension. Participants were 12 children diagnosed as dyslexic matched with 12 typically achieving peers of similar age and gender. Baseline assessment consisted of a clinical neuropsychological battery of tests and Event Related Potentials (ERPs) and resulted in confirming the discrepancy between the dyslexic and the control group. Following the remediation program, the dyslexic group did not differ significantly from their control group in six out of eight neuropsychological tests. The electrophysiological results revealed that the two groups had similar P300 latencies in 12 out of the 15 electroencephalographic sites assessed. These findings suggest that children with dyslexia can improve their abilities through a remediation program which aims to strengthen their audio-visual and phonological processes along with their working memory capability.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The Dyslexia-susceptibility Protein KIAA0319 Inhibits Axon Growth Through Smad2 Signaling.KIAA0319 is a transmembrane protein associated with dyslexia with a presumed role in neuronal migration. Here we show that KIAA0319 expression is not restricted to the brain but also occurs in sensory and spinal cord neurons, increasing from early postnatal stages to adulthood and being downregulated by injury. This suggested that KIAA0319 participates in functions unrelated to neuronal migration. Supporting this hypothesis, overexpression of KIAA0319 repressed axon growth in hippocampal and dorsal root ganglia neurons; the intracellular domain of KIAA0319 was sufficient to elicit this effect. A similar inhibitory effect was observed in vivo as axon regeneration was impaired after transduction of sensory neurons with KIAA0319. Conversely, the deletion of Kiaa0319 in neurons increased neurite outgrowth in vitro and improved axon regeneration in vivo. At the mechanistic level, KIAA0319 engaged the JAK2-SH2B1 pathway to activate Smad2, which played a central role in KIAA0319-mediated repression of axon growth. In summary, we establish KIAA0319 as a novel player in axon growth and regeneration with the ability to repress the intrinsic growth potential of axons. This study describes a novel regulatory mechanism operating during peripheral nervous system and central nervous system axon growth, and offers novel targets for the development of effective therapies to promote axon regeneration.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Reading problems and major mental disorders - co-occurrences and familial overlaps in a Swedish nationwide cohort.Reading problems often co-occur with ADHD and conduct disorder. However, the patterns of co-occurrence and familial overlap between reading problems and other psychiatric disorders have not been systematically explored. We conducted a register-based cohort study including 8719 individuals with reading problems and their siblings, along with matched comparison individuals. Conditional logistic regressions estimated risks for ADHD, autism, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anorexia nervosa, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, substance use disorder, and violent/non-violent criminality in individuals with reading problems and their siblings. Diagnoses of psychiatric disorders were physician-assigned and ascertained from the Swedish National Patient Register, and crime convictions from the Swedish National Crime Register. We found that individuals with reading problems had excess risks for all psychiatric disorders (except anorexia nervosa) and criminality, with risk ratios between 1.34 and 4.91. Siblings of individuals with reading problems showed excess risks for ADHD, autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, substance use disorder, and non-violent criminality, with risk ratios between 1.14 and 1.70. In summary, individuals with reading problems had increased risks of virtually all psychiatric disorders, and criminality. The origin of most of these overlaps was familial, in that siblings of individuals with reading problems also had elevated risks of ADHD, autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, substance use disorder, and non-violent criminality. These findings have implications for gene-searching efforts, and suggest that health care practitioners should be alert for signs of psychiatric disorders in families where reading problems exist.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Evidence for a differential interference of noise in sub-lexical and lexical reading routes in healthy participants and dyslexics.The ineffective exclusion of surrounding noise has been proposed to underlie the reading deficits in developmental dyslexia. However, previous studies supporting this hypothesis focused on low-level visual tasks, providing only an indirect link of noise interference on reading processes. In this study, we investigated the effect of noise on regular, irregular, and pseudoword reading in 23 dyslexic children and 26 age- and IQ-matched controls, by applying the white noise displays typically used to validate this theory to a lexical decision task. Reading performance and eye movements were measured. Results showed that white noise did not consistently affect dyslexic readers more than typical readers. Noise affected more dyslexic than typical readers in terms of reading accuracy, but it affected more typical than dyslexic readers in terms of response time and eye movements (number of fixations and regressions). Furthermore, in typical readers, noise affected more the speed of reading of pseudowords than real words. These results suggest a particular impact of noise on the sub-lexical reading route where attention has to be deployed to individual letters. The use of a lexical route would reduce the effect of noise. A differential impact of noise between words and pseudowords may therefore not be evident in dyslexic children if they are not yet proficient in using the lexical route. These findings indicate that the type of reading stimuli and consequent reading strategies play an important role in determining the effects of noise interference in reading processing and should be taken into account by further studies.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Problems with visual statistical learning in developmental dyslexia.Previous research shows that dyslexic readers are impaired in their recognition of faces and other complex objects, and show hypoactivation in ventral visual stream regions that support word and object recognition. Responses of these brain regions are shaped by visual statistical learning. If such learning is compromised, people should be less sensitive to statistically likely feature combinations in words and other objects, and impaired visual word and object recognition should be expected. We therefore tested whether people with dyslexia showed diminished capability for visual statistical learning. Matched dyslexic and typical readers participated in tests of visual statistical learning of pairs of novel shapes that frequently appeared together. Dyslexic readers on average recognized fewer pairs than typical readers, indicating some problems with visual statistical learning. These group differences were not accounted for by differences in intelligence, ability to remember individual shapes, or spatial attention paid to the stimuli, but other attentional problems could play a mediating role. Deficiencies in visual statistical learning may in some cases prevent appropriate experience-driven shaping of neuronal responses in the ventral visual stream, hampering visual word and object recognition.\n",

The present study focused on local or global visuospatial processing in children with nonverbal learning disability (NLD) and dyslexia compared with typically-developing (TD) controls. Participants were presented with a modified block design task (BDT), in both a typical visuo-constructive version that involves reconstructing figures from blocks, and a perceptual version in which respondents must rapidly match unfragmented figures with a corresponding fragmented target figure. The figures used in the tasks were devised by manipulating two variables: the perceptual cohesiveness and the task uncertainty, stimulating global or local processes. Our results confirmed that children with NLD had more problems with the visuo-constructive version of the task, whereas those with dyslexia showed only a slight difficulty with the visuo-constructive version, but were in greater difficulty with the perceptual version, especially in terms of response times. These findings are interpreted in relation to the slower visual processing speed of children with dyslexia, and to the visuo-constructive problems and difficulty in using flexibly-experienced global vs local processes of children with NLD.

      "ABSTRACT Revisiting the \"enigma\" of musicians with dyslexia: Auditory sequencing and speech abilities.Previous research has suggested a link between musical training and auditory processing skills. Musicians have shown enhanced perception of auditory features critical to both music and speech, suggesting that this link extends beyond basic auditory processing. It remains unclear to what extent musicians who also have dyslexia show these specialized abilities, considering often-observed persistent deficits that coincide with reading impairments. The present study evaluated auditory sequencing and speech discrimination in 52 adults comprised of musicians with dyslexia, nonmusicians with dyslexia, and typical musicians. An auditory sequencing task measuring perceptual acuity for tone sequences of increasing length was administered. Furthermore, subjects were asked to discriminate synthesized syllable continua varying in acoustic components of speech necessary for intraphonemic discrimination, which included spectral (formant frequency) and temporal (voice onset time [VOT] and amplitude envelope) features. Results indicate that musicians with dyslexia did not significantly differ from typical musicians and performed better than nonmusicians with dyslexia for auditory sequencing as well as discrimination of spectral and VOT cues within syllable continua. However, typical musicians demonstrated superior performance relative to both groups with dyslexia for discrimination of syllables varying in amplitude information. These findings suggest a distinct profile of speech processing abilities in musicians with dyslexia, with specific weaknesses in discerning amplitude cues within speech. Because these difficulties seem to remain persistent in adults with dyslexia despite musical training, this study only partly supports the potential for musical training to enhance the auditory processing skills known to be crucial for literacy in individuals with dyslexia.

      "ABSTRACT Neural Noise Hypothesis of Developmental Dyslexia.Developmental dyslexia (decoding-based reading disorder; RD) is a complex trait with multifactorial origins at the genetic, neural, and cognitive levels. There is evidence that low-level sensory-processing deficits precede and underlie phonological problems, which are one of the best-documented aspects of RD. RD is also associated with impairments in integrating visual symbols with their corresponding speech sounds. Although causal relationships between sensory processing, print-speech integration, and fluent reading, and their neural bases are debated, these processes all require precise timing mechanisms across distributed brain networks. Neural excitability and neural noise are fundamental to these timing mechanisms. Here, we propose that neural noise stemming from increased neural excitability in cortical networks implicated in reading is one key distal contributor to RD.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Reading Disability Spectrum: Early and Late Recognition, Subthreshold, and Full Comorbidity.Several studies have reported high comorbidity for reading disability (RD) and psychiatric disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the comorbidity of subthreshold and full psychiatric disorders with RD while comparing subgroups based on age of RD recognition (early vs. late). We analyzed data from 130 children with RD and 82 typically developing children aged 7 to 18 years. RD was assessed with the Dyslexia Differential Diagnosis Maastricht-Hungarian Standard Test. Psychiatric diagnoses were based on the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Kid. Chi-square tests were used for group comparisons of the prevalence of subthreshold and full disorders. A higher proportion of children in the RD group were assessed as having internalizing or externalizing disorders. When subthreshold and full diagnoses were considered together, the prevalence of internalizing but not externalizing pathology was higher in the RD group than the control group. The prevalence of internalizing pathology was similar in the early and late RD subgroups, but externalizing pathology was more common in the late RD subgroup. When subthreshold and full diagnoses were considered together, mood disorder and externalizing pathology were more prevalent in the late RD subgroup than the early RD subgroup. This study demonstrated that early recognition of RD may play a role in determining comorbid psychopathology and should therefore be an educational and clinical priority. Clinicians should routinely screen children with RD for comorbid disorders, including subthreshold pathology.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Effect of chunk strength on the performance of children with developmental dyslexia on artificial grammar learning task may be related to complexity.There's a long held view that chunks play a crucial role in artificial grammar learning performance. We compared chunk strength influences on performance, in high and low topological entropy (a measure of complexity) grammar systems, with dyslexic children, age-matched and reading-level-matched control participants. Findings show that age-matched control participants' performance reflected equivalent influence of chunk strength in the two topological entropy conditions, as typically found in artificial grammar learning experiments. By contrast, dyslexic children and reading-level-matched controls' performance reflected knowledge of chunk strength only under the low topological entropy condition. In the low topological entropy grammar system, they appeared completely unable to utilize chunk strength to make appropriate test item selections. In line with previous research, this study suggests that for typically developing children, it is the chunks that are attended during artificial grammar learning and create a foundation on which implicit associative learning mechanisms operate, and these chunks are unitized to different strengths. However, for children with dyslexia, it is complexity that may influence the subsequent memorability of chunks, independently of their strength.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Multi-step treatment for acquired alexia and agraphia (Part I): efficacy, generalisation, and identification of beneficial treatment steps.Reading and writing impairments are common in individuals with post-stroke aphasia. Treatment typically aims to improve the function of one of these modalities by strengthening aspects of either lexical or sublexical processing. In the present study, eight adults with acquired alexia and agraphia were administered a comprehensive treatment targeting specific lexical and sublexical processes underlying reading and/or writing. Two participants were trained in reading and six were trained in writing. Throughout treatment, reading and writing accuracy were monitored for trained items, as well as untrained but orthographically and semantically related items. Linear mixed effects models indicated that the most substantial gains were made on trained items in the trained modality; generalisation to trained items in the untrained modality and untrained but related items in both modalities was also observed. Participants improved significantly on a subset of treatment steps intended to address lexical access and representations, sublexical conversion mechanisms, and the graphemic and/or phonological buffer processes in both modalities. These results demonstrate the efficacy of a novel, comprehensive treatment protocol and suggest that targeting multiple reading and writing processes in conjunction may facilitate widespread generalisation.\n",

      "ABSTRACT [Brodmann Areas 39 and 40: Human Parietal Association Area and Higher Cortical Function].The anatomy and function of the angular gyrus (Brodmann Area 39) and supramarginal gyrus (Brodmann Area 40) are described here. Both gyri constitute the inferior part of the parietal lobe. Association fibers from the angular gyrus project to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex via the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) II/arcuate fasciculus (AF), whereas those from the supramarginal gyrus project to the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex via SLF III/AF. Damage to the left angular gyrus causes kanji agraphia (lexical agraphia) and mild anomia, whereas damage to the left supramarginal gyrus causes kana alexia (phonological dyslexia) and kana agraphia (phonological agraphia). Damage to either gyrus causes Gerstmann's syndrome (finger agnosia, left-right disorientation, agraphia and acalculia) and verbal short-term memory impairment. \"Angular alexia with agraphia\" results from damage to the middle occipital gyrus posterior to the angular gyrus. Alexia and agraphia, with lesions in the angular or supramarginal gyrus, are characterized by kana transposition errors in reading words, which suggests the impairment of sequential phonological processing.\n",

Neonates with malrotation of the intestines without volvulus usually do not have co-morbidities or syndromes.

      "ABSTRACT Design and Implementation of a Tactile Stimulation Device to Increase Auditory Discrimination.Reading is a complex process that requires various simultaneous brain processes. One of the most common types of reading disorders is developmental dyslexia, and one of the objectives of speech therapy sessions for children with developmental dyslexia is to increase their auditory discrimination. One of the most commonly used Auditory Discrimination Tests (ADTs) is Wepman's  Auditory Discrimination Test (WADT). It includes minimal pair words categorized by characteristics of vowels and consonants. The goal of this research is to design and implement a tactile stimulation device based on Wepman's test to increase auditory discrimination in children with developmental dyslexia in therapy sessions, so that while playing each word for the children, vibrational cues are presented to their left palm and fingers. The vibrational cues provided by 23 vibration motors can notify the child of the difference or similarity between the words. First, the device was evaluated by being applied on six female participants aged 6 to 8 with no hearing disabilities and no developmental dyslexia. Scores obtained from the healthy children showed that they can perceive the tactile function of the device. Then, function of the device was tested on 8-year-old twin girls with developmental dyslexia. The test was conducted as a controlled experiment. One of the twins participated in speech therapy treatment, while the other practiced with the device. During the study, three sessions were allocated to determine the baseline of auditory discrimination, three sessions to the intervention, and two sessions (the first, one week and the second, three weeks after the intervention sessions) to determine the children's auditory discrimination (follow-up). The analysis of trend variations and changes in mean showed that both the speech therapy and the intervention based on practicing with the device were effective in increasing children's auditory discrimination (Percentage of Non-overlapping Data = 100%). The results were stable three weeks after the intervention sessions. Therefore, using the device in speech therapy sessions can be useful and effective in improving auditory discrimination.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Shared temporoparietal dysfunction in dyslexia and typical readers with discrepantly high IQ.It is currently believed that reading disability (RD) should be defined by reading level without regard to broader aptitude (IQ). There is debate, however, about how to classify individuals who read in the typical range but less well than would be expected by their higher IQ. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 49 children to examine whether those with typical, but discrepantly low reading ability relative to IQ, show dyslexia-like activation patterns during reading. Children who were typical readers with high-IQ discrepancy showed reduced activation in left temporoparietal neocortex relative to two control groups of typical readers without IQ discrepancy. This pattern was consistent and spatially overlapping with results in children with RD compared to typically reading children. The results suggest a shared neurological atypicality in regions associated with phonological processing between children with dyslexia and children with typical reading ability that is substantially below their IQ.\n",

      "ABSTRACT 15q11.2 CNV affects cognitive, structural and functional correlates of dyslexia and dyscalculia.Several copy number variants have been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders and these variants have been shown to also influence cognitive abilities in carriers unaffected by psychiatric disorders. Previously, we associated the 15q11.2(BP1-BP2) deletion with specific learning disabilities and a larger corpus callosum. Here we investigate, in a much larger sample, the effect of the 15q11.2(BP1-BP2) deletion on cognitive, structural and functional correlates of dyslexia and dyscalculia. We report that the deletion confers greatest risk of the combined phenotype of dyslexia and dyscalculia. We also show that the deletion associates with a smaller left fusiform gyrus. Moreover, tailored functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments using phonological lexical decision and multiplication verification tasks demonstrate altered activation in the left fusiform and the left angular gyri in carriers. Thus, by using convergent evidence from neuropsychological testing, and structural and functional neuroimaging, we show that the 15q11.2(BP1-BP2) deletion affects cognitive, structural and functional correlates of both dyslexia and dyscalculia.\n",

      "ABSTRACT An oscillopathic approach to developmental dyslexia: From genes to speech processing.Developmental dyslexia is a heterogeneous condition entailing problems with reading and spelling. Several genes have been linked or associated to the disease, many of which contribute to the development and function of brain areas important for auditory and phonological processing. Nonetheless, a clear link between genes, the brain, and the symptoms of dyslexia is still pending. The goal of this paper is contributing to bridge this gap. With this aim, we have focused on how the dyslexic brain fails to process speech sounds and reading cues. We have adopted an oscillatory perspective, according to which dyslexia may result from a deficient integration of different brain rhythms during reading/spellings tasks. Moreover, we show that some candidate genes for this condition are related to brain rhythms. This fresh approach is expected to provide a better understanding of the aetiology and the clinical presentation of developmental dyslexia, but also to achieve an earlier and more accurate diagnosis of the disease.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Encoding of rapid time-varying information is impaired in poor readers.A characteristic set of eye movements and fixations are made during reading, so the position of words on the retinae is constantly being updated. Effective decoding of print requires this temporal stream of visual information to be segmented or parsed into its constituent units (e.g., letters or words). Poor readers' difficulties with word recognition could arise at the point of segmenting time-varying visual information, but the mechanisms underlying this process are little understood. Here, we used random-dot displays to explore the effects of reading ability on temporal segmentation. Thirty-eight adult readers viewed test stimuli that were temporally segmented by constraining either local motions or analogous form cues to oscillate back and fourth at each of a range of rates. Participants had to discriminate these segmented patterns from comparison stimuli containing the same motion and form cues but these were temporally intermingled. Results showed that the motion and form tasks could not be performed reliably when segment duration was shorter than a temporal resolution (acuity) limit. The acuity limits for both tasks were significantly and negatively correlated with reading scores. Importantly, the minimum segment duration needed to detect the temporally segmented stimuli was longer in relatively poor readers than relatively good readers. This demonstrates that adult poor readers have difficulty segmenting temporally changing visual input particularly at short segment durations. These results are consistent with evidence suggesting that precise encoding of rapid time-varying information is impaired in developmental dyslexia.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Psychological Well-being Trajectories of Individuals with Dyslexia Aged 3-11 Years.Dyslexia has been associated with a range of psychological well-being issues in childhood. However, it is unclear if these difficulties stem from coping with academic struggles at school, or from other pre-existing diagnoses that sometimes co-occur with dyslexia. Using UK Millennium Cohort Study data (n = 7224) from 2003 to 2011, the present study compared psychological well-being development from ages 3-11 years for children with (1) dyslexia only; (2) special educational needs excluding dyslexia; (3) comorbid dyslexia and other special educational needs; and (4) no special educational needs. Growth curve modelling results controlling for race, gender, age and family income suggested that with the exception of conduct difficulties, psychological well-being issues related to dyslexia do not occur preschool; rather, they commence upon starting school.

      "ABSTRACT Word Decoding Development during Phonics Instruction in Children at Risk for Dyslexia.In the present study, we examined the early word decoding development of 73 children at genetic risk of dyslexia and 73 matched controls. We conducted monthly curriculum-embedded word decoding measures during the first 5 months of phonics-based reading instruction followed by standardized word decoding measures halfway and by the end of first grade. In kindergarten, vocabulary, phonological awareness, lexical retrieval, and verbal and visual short-term memory were assessed. The results showed that the children at risk were less skilled in phonemic awareness in kindergarten. During the first 5 months of reading instruction, children at risk were less efficient in word decoding and the discrepancy increased over the months. In subsequent months, the discrepancy prevailed for simple words but increased for more complex words. Phonemic awareness and lexical retrieval predicted the reading development in children at risk and controls to the same extent. It is concluded that children at risk are behind their typical peers in word decoding development starting from the very beginning. Furthermore, it is concluded that the disadvantage increased during phonics instruction and that the same predictors underlie the development of word decoding in the two groups of children.

Comparing the cognitive profiles of dyslexia and specific language impairment and their roles in learning.The aim of the present study is to explore whether those with Specific Language Impairment (SLI) and dyslexia display distinct or overlapping cognitive profiles with respect to learning outcomes. In particular, we were interested in two key cognitive skills associated with academic performance - working memory and IQ. We recruited three groups of children - those with SLI, those with dyslexia, and a control group. All children were given standardized tests of working memory, IQ (vocabulary and matrix), spelling, and math. The pattern of results suggests that both children with dyslexia and SLI are characterized with poorer verbal working memory and IQ compared to controls, but preserved nonverbal cognitive skills. It appears that that these two disorder groups cannot be distinguished by the severity of their cognitive deficits. However, there was a differential pattern with respect to learning outcomes, where the children with dyslexia rely more on visual skills in spelling, while those with SLI use their relative strengths in vocabulary. These findings can have important implications for how intervention is tailored in the classroom, as disorder-specific support could yield important gains in learning.\n",

We evaluated all the patients with stroke who were admitted to the Department of Neurology, University Clinical Centre Tuzla in period of six months, who developed poststroke alexia, agraphia, acalculia, or different combinations of these language disorders. Outcome of these patients was evaluated again after 24 months. For clinical assessment of alexia, agraphia, and acalculia we used Minnesota Test for Differential Diagnosis of Aphasia. We investigated 59 (30.5%) of 193 stroke patients with alexia, agraphia, acalculia, and combinations. Outcome of these patients after 24 months was: 37 (62.7%) died, 13 (22%) fully recovered, and 9 (15.3%) of them retained the same disorder or developed dementia or blindness. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that patients with combined language disorders had significantly higher mortality.

      "ABSTRACT Verbal and Non-verbal Fluency in Adults with Developmental Dyslexia: Phonological Processing or Executive Control Problems?The executive function of fluency describes the ability to generate items according to specific rules. Production of words beginning with a certain letter (phonemic fluency) is impaired in dyslexia, while generation of words belonging to a certain semantic category (semantic fluency) is typically unimpaired. However, in dyslexia, verbal fluency has generally been studied only in terms of overall words produced. Furthermore, performance of adults with dyslexia on non-verbal design fluency tasks has not been explored but would indicate whether deficits could be explained by executive control, rather than phonological processing, difficulties. Phonemic, semantic and design fluency tasks were presented to adults with dyslexia and without dyslexia, using fine-grained performance measures and controlling for IQ. Hierarchical regressions indicated that dyslexia predicted lower phonemic fluency, but not semantic or design fluency. At the fine-grained level, dyslexia predicted a smaller number of switches between subcategories on phonemic fluency, while dyslexia did not predict the size of phonemically related clusters of items. Overall, the results suggested that phonological processing problems were at the root of dyslexia-related fluency deficits; however, executive control difficulties could not be completely ruled out as an alternative explanation. Developments in research methodology, equating executive demands across fluency tasks, may resolve this issue. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Short-term Memory in Childhood Dyslexia: Deficient Serial Order in Multiple Modalities.In children with dyslexia, deficits in working memory have not been well-specified. We assessed second-grade children with dyslexia, with and without concomitant specific language impairment, and children with typical development. Immediate serial recall of lists of phonological (non-word), lexical (digit), spatial (location) and visual (shape) items were included. For the latter three modalities, we used not only standard span but also running span tasks, in which the list length was unpredictable to limit mnemonic strategies. Non-word repetition tests indicated a phonological memory deficit in children with dyslexia alone compared with those with typical development, but this difference vanished when these groups were matched for non-verbal intelligence and language. Theoretically important deficits in serial order memory in dyslexic children, however, persisted relative to matched typically developing children. The deficits were in recall of (1) spoken digits in both standard and running span tasks and (2) spatial locations, in running span only. Children with dyslexia with versus without language impairment, when matched on non-verbal intelligence, had comparable serial order memory, but differed in phonology. Because serial orderings of verbal and spatial elements occur in reading, the careful examination of order memory may allow a deeper understanding of dyslexia and its relation to language impairment.

      "ABSTRACT Spatiotemporal reorganization of the reading network in adult dyslexia.Developmental dyslexia is characterized by impairments in reading fluency and spelling that persist into adulthood. Here, we hypothesized that high-achieving adult dyslexics (i.e., university students with a history of dyslexia) manage to cope with these deficits by relying to a greater extent on morphological information than do non-impaired adult readers. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) in a primed lexical decision task, in which we contrasted orthographic, morphological and semantic processing. Behavioral results confirmed that adult dyslexics did indeed rely to a greater extent on the semantic properties of morphemes than controls. In line with this, MEG results showed early morphological effects (100-200 msec) in a frontal network, which reflected the contribution of semantic processing. The same effects occurred much later in controls (∼400 msec). In contrast, controls showed early orthographic priming effects in posterior left inferior temporal gyrus (LITG) at around 130 msec, which were not seen in dyslexics. In the LITG, dyslexics showed only late activation of semantic and orthographic information. The present results suggest a spatiotemporal reorganization of the reading network, in which morphological information located in frontal regions is activated earlier in high-achieving adults dyslexics than controls.\n",

However, we currently ignore the neural states that predispose to an accurate perception within different crowding regimes. Here, we performed single-trial analyses of the electroencephalographical (EEG) oscillations, evaluating the prestimulus power and phase differences between correct and incorrect discrimination during a letter-crowding task, where irrelevant letters were placed nearby (strong crowding) or far (mid crowding) relative to the target. Results show that prestimulus alpha (8-12Hz) power was related to target discrimination in the mid, but not in the strong, crowding condition. Importantly, accurate discrimination in the strong crowding condition was predicted by the phase of alpha and by the power of beta (13-20Hz) oscillations. These evidence suggest that both periodic visual sampling mechanisms, reflected in the alpha phase, and network predisposition to extract local information, reflected in the beta power, predispose to object discrimination in a crowded scene.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Audiovisual speech integration in the superior temporal region is dysfunctional in dyslexia.Dyslexia is an impairment of reading and spelling that affects both children and adults even after many years of schooling. Dyslexic readers have deficits in the integration of auditory and visual inputs but the neural mechanisms of the deficits are still unclear. This fMRI study examined the neural processing of auditorily presented German numbers 0-9 and videos of lip movements of a German native speaker voicing numbers 0-9 in unimodal (auditory or visual) and bimodal (always congruent) conditions in dyslexic readers and their matched fluent readers. We confirmed results of previous studies that the superior temporal gyrus/sulcus plays a critical role in audiovisual speech integration: fluent readers showed greater superior temporal activations for combined audiovisual stimuli than auditory-/visual-only stimuli. Importantly, such an enhancement effect was absent in dyslexic readers. Moreover, the auditory network (bilateral superior temporal regions plus medial PFC) was dynamically modulated during audiovisual integration in fluent, but not in dyslexic readers. These results suggest that superior temporal dysfunction may underly poor audiovisual speech integration in readers with dyslexia.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The effects of the constancy of location and order in working memory visual-phonological binding of children with dyslexia.It has been suggested that children with dyslexia have difficulties in visual-phonological working memory (WM) binding, supporting the hypothesis that this ability is crucial in the formation of associations between written forms and phonological codes required by reading. However, research on this topic is currently scarce and has not clarified to what extent binding may be supported by spatial and temporal information. The present study examined visual-phonological WM binding performance in a group of children with dyslexia compared to a control group of typically developing children matched for age, gender, and grade. Children had to memorize ephemeral associations between meaningless shapes and nonwords, with stimuli presented in either fixed or variable spatial locations, and in either fixed or variable temporal order across trials; performance was assessed using a recognition task. Results showed that children with dyslexia have a deficit in visual-phonological WM binding in every presentation condition and that, unlike control children, they are not able to use fixed spatial locations as an aid to bind information. Crucially, however, children with dyslexia still benefit from the presentation of stimuli in a fixed temporal order. These findings support the hypothesis that a WM binding deficit is crucial in children with dyslexia, and have potential implications for treatment strategies.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Shared and differentiated motor skill impairments in children with dyslexia and/or attention deficit disorder: From simple to complex sequential coordination.Dyslexia and Attention deficit disorder (AD) are prevalent neurodevelopmental conditions in children and adolescents. They have high comorbidity rates and have both been associated with motor difficulties. Little is known, however, about what is shared or differentiated in dyslexia and AD in terms of motor abilities. Even when motor skill problems are identified, few studies have used the same measurement tools, resulting in inconstant findings. The present study assessed increasingly complex gross motor skills in children and adolescents with dyslexia, AD, and with both Dyslexia and AD. Our results suggest normal performance on simple motor-speed tests, whereas all three groups share a common impairment on unimanual and bimanual sequential motor tasks. Children in these groups generally improve with practice to the same level as normal subjects, though they make more errors. In addition, children with AD are the most impaired on complex bimanual out-of-phase movements and with manual dexterity. These latter findings are examined in light of the Multiple Deficit Model.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Novel reading index for identifying disordered reading skill development: A preliminary study.Children with ADHD are at high risk of developing a Reading Disability (RD), although the reasons remain unclear. ADHD-associated impairments, including processing speed, can complicate clinical evaluation for a co-occurring RD diagnosis. We propose a novel metric to (a) assess reading development and (b) provide an alternative method to classifying readers that may aid investigations for etiologies of RD in ADHD. Specifically, as both phonological decoding and word recognition skills are important precursors of reading fluency, we propose a new quantitative method comparing these skills after accounting for variations in perception, motor response, or processing speeds. Forty boys (14 control, 15 ADHD, 11 ADHD/ + RD) completed a lexical decision task testing decoding and another assessing word recognition. Response time data was modeled using a Drift Diffusion approach to estimate the underlying reading skills. Using these reading skill estimates, we calculated a novel Reading Tendency Index and classified participants into three reading groups (Decoders, Balanced Readers, and Sight Readers). The reading and cognitive performance of these groups were consistent with theoretical predictions and subsequently provided external validity for the novel Reading Tendency Index classification. Our findings demonstrate a potential classification tool for readers based on individual's developed, reading tendencies.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Auditory processing deficits are sometimes necessary and sometimes sufficient for language difficulties in children: Evidence from mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss.There is a general consensus that many children and adults with dyslexia and/or specific language impairment display deficits in auditory processing. However, how these deficits are related to developmental disorders of language is uncertain, and at least four categories of model have been proposed: single distal cause models, risk factor models, association models, and consequence models. This study used children with mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss (MMHL) to investigate the link between auditory processing deficits and language disorders. We examined the auditory processing and language skills of 46, 8-16year-old children with MMHL and 44 age-matched typically developing controls. Auditory processing abilities were assessed using child-friendly psychophysical techniques in order to obtain discrimination thresholds. Stimuli incorporated three different timescales (µs, ms, s) and three different levels of complexity (simple nonspeech tones, complex nonspeech sounds, speech sounds), and tasks required discrimination of frequency or amplitude cues. Language abilities were assessed using a battery of standardised assessments of phonological processing, reading, vocabulary, and grammar. We found evidence that three different auditory processing abilities showed different relationships with language: Deficits in a general auditory processing component were necessary but not sufficient for language difficulties, and were consistent with a risk factor model; Deficits in slow-rate amplitude modulation (envelope) detection were sufficient but not necessary for language difficulties, and were consistent with either a single distal cause or a consequence model; And deficits in the discrimination of a single speech contrast (/bɑ/ vs /dɑ/) were neither necessary nor sufficient for language difficulties, and were consistent with an association model. Our findings suggest that different auditory processing deficits may constitute distinct and independent routes to the development of language difficulties in children.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Reading and lexical-decision tasks generate different patterns of individual variability as a function of condition difficulty.We reanalyzed previous experiments based on lexical-decision and reading-aloud tasks in children with dyslexia and control children and tested the prediction of the difference engine model (DEM) that mean condition reaction times (RTs) and standard deviations (SDs) would be linearly related (Myerson et al., 2003). Then we evaluated the slope and the intercept with the x-axis of these linear functions in comparison with previously reported values (i.e., slope of about 0.30 and intercept of about 300 ms). In the case of lexical decision, the parameters were close to these values; by contrast, in the case of reading aloud, a much steeper slope (0.66) and a greater intercept (482.6 ms) were found. Therefore, interindividual variability grows at a much faster rate as a function of condition difficulty for reading than for lexical-decision tasks (or for other tasks reported in the literature). According to the DEM, the slope of the regression that relates means and SDs indicates the degree of correlation among the durations of the stages of processing. We propose that the need for a close coupling between orthographic and phonological processing in reading is what drives the particularly strong relationship between performance and interindividual variability that we observed in reading tasks.\n",

Participants were provided with 20 min of training aimed at learning eight new basic letter-speech sound correspondences, followed by a short assessment of mastery of the correspondences and word-reading ability in this unfamiliar script. Our results demonstrated that brief training is moderately successful in differentiating dyslexic readers from normal readers in their ability to learn letter-speech sound correspondences. The normal readers outperformed the dyslexic readers for accuracy and speed on a letter-speech sound matching task, as well as on a word-reading task containing familiar words written in the artificial orthography. Importantly, the new artificial script-related measures were related to phonological awareness and rapid automatized naming and made a unique contribution in predicting individual differences in reading and spelling ability.

      "ABSTRACT Complex phenotypes associated with STIM1 mutations in both coiled coil and EF-hand domains.Dominant mutations in STIM1 are a cause of three allelic conditions: tubular aggregate myopathy, Stormorken syndrome (a complex phenotype including myopathy, hyposplenism, hypocalcaemia and bleeding diathesis), and a platelet dysfunction disorder, York platelet syndrome. Previous reports have suggested a genotype-phenotype correlation with mutations in the N-terminal EF-hand domain associated with tubular aggregate myopathy, and a common mutation at p.R304W in a coiled coil domain associated with Stormorken syndrome. In this study individuals with STIM1 variants were identified by exome sequencing or STIM1 direct sequencing, and assessed for neuromuscular, haematological and biochemical evidence of the allelic disorders of STIM1. STIM1 mutations were investigated by fibroblast calcium imaging and 3D modelling. Six individuals with STIM1 mutations, including two novel mutations (c.262A>G (p.S88G) and c.911G>A (p.R304Q)), were identified. Extra-neuromuscular symptoms including thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction, hypocalcaemia or hyposplenism were present in 5/6 patients with mutations in both the EF-hand and CC domains. 3/6 patients had psychiatric disorders, not previously reported in STIM1 disease. Review of published STIM1 patients (n = 49) confirmed that neuromuscular symptoms are present in most patients. We conclude that the phenotype associated with activating STIM1 mutations frequently includes extra-neuromuscular features such as hypocalcaemia, hypo-/asplenia and platelet dysfunction regardless of mutation domain.\n",

Recent evidence, however, indicates the need for a more general explanatory framework to account for DD's range of deficits. The current study examined the specificity versus domain generality of DD by comparing the recognition and discrimination of three visual categories (faces and words with cars as control stimuli) in typical and dyslexic readers. Relative to controls, not only did dyslexic individuals perform more poorly on word recognition, but they also matched faces more slowly, especially when the faces differed in viewpoint, and discriminated between similar faces (but not cars) more poorly. Additionally, dyslexics showed reduced hemispheric lateralization for words and faces. These results reveal that DD affects both word and face, but not car, processing, implicating a partial domain general basis of DD.

      "ABSTRACT Early Identification of Reading Difficulties: A Screening Strategy that Adjusts the Sensitivity to the Level of Prediction Accuracy.Early screening for reading difficulties before the onset of instruction is desirable because it allows intervention that is targeted at prevention rather than remediation of reading difficulties. However, early screening may be too inaccurate to effectively allocate resources to those who need them. The present study compared the accuracy of early screening before the onset of formal reading instruction with late screening six months into the first year of instruction. The study followed 164 Danish students from the end of Grade 0 to the end of Grade 2. Early screening included measures of phonemic awareness, rapid naming, letter knowledge, paired associate learning, and reading. Late screening included only reading. Results indicated that reading measures improved substantially as predictors over the first six months of Grade 1, to the point where late reading measures alone provided as much information as the early measures combined. In the light of these results and a less than perfect early screening accuracy, a new strategy for screening is introduced and discussed. The strategy proposes multi-point screening with gradually increasing sensitivity to strike a balance between manageable screening procedures and outcomes and early identification of students who are most likely in need of extra resources.

We simultaneously recorded eye movements and postural control while children were viewing different types of emotional faces. Twenty-two children with dyslexia and twenty-two aged-matched children without dyslexia participated in the study. We analysed the surface area, the length and the mean velocity of the centre of pressure for balance in parallel with visual saccadic latency, the number of saccades and the time spent in regions of interest. Our results showed that postural stability in children with dyslexia was weaker and the surface area of their centre of pressure increased significantly when they viewed an unpleasant face. Moreover, children with dyslexia had different strategies to those used by children without dyslexia during visual exploration, and in particular when they viewed unpleasant emotional faces. We suggest that lower performance in emotional face processing in children with dyslexia could be due to a difference in their visual strategies, linked to their identification of unpleasant emotional faces.

In particular, inefficient shifting of visual attention during spatial cueing paradigms is assumed to be associated with problems in graphemic parsing during sublexical reading. The current study investigated visuo-spatial attention performance in an exogenous cueing paradigm in a large sample (N = 191) of third and fourth graders with different reading and spelling profiles (controls, isolated reading deficit, isolated spelling deficit, combined deficit in reading and spelling). Once individual variability in reaction times was taken into account by means of z-transformation, a cueing deficit (i.e. no significant difference between valid and invalid trials) was found for children with combined deficits in reading and spelling. However, poor readers without spelling problems showed a cueing effect comparable to controls, but exhibited a particularly strong right-over-left advantage (position effect). Isolated poor spellers showed a significant cueing effect, but no position effect. While we replicated earlier findings of a reduced cueing effect among poor nonword readers (indicating deficits in sublexical processing), we also found a reduced cueing effect among children with particularly poor orthographic spelling (indicating deficits in lexical processing). Thus, earlier claims of a specific association with nonword reading could not be confirmed. Controlling for ADHD-symptoms reported in a parental questionnaire did not impact on the statistical analysis, indicating that cueing deficits are not caused by more general attentional limitations. Between 31 and 48% of participants in the three reading and/or spelling deficit groups as well as 32% of the control group showed reduced spatial cueing. These findings indicate a significant, but moderate association between certain aspects of visuo-spatial attention and subcomponents of written language processing, the causal status of which is yet unclear.\n",

      "ABSTRACT A longitudinal study investigating neural processing of speech envelope modulation rates in children with (a family risk for) dyslexia.Recent evidence suggests that a fundamental deficit in the synchronization of neural oscillations to temporal information in speech may underlie phonological processing problems in dyslexia. Since previous studies were performed cross-sectionally in school-aged children or adults, developmental aspects of neural auditory processing in relation to reading acquisition and dyslexia remain to be investigated. The present longitudinal study followed 68 children during development from pre-reader (5 years old) to beginning reader (7 years old) and more advanced reader (9 years old). Thirty-six children had a family risk for dyslexia and 14 children eventually developed dyslexia. EEG recordings of auditory steady-state responses to 4 and 20 Hz modulations, corresponding to syllable and phoneme rates, were collected at each point in time. Our results demonstrate an increase in neural synchronization to phoneme-rate modulations around the onset of reading acquisition. This effect was negatively correlated with later reading and phonological skills, indicating that children who exhibit the largest increase in neural synchronization to phoneme rates, develop the poorest reading and phonological skills. Accordingly, neural synchronization to phoneme-rate modulations was found to be significantly higher in beginning and more advanced readers with dyslexia. We found no developmental effects regarding neural synchronization to syllable rates, nor any effects of a family risk for dyslexia. Altogether, our findings suggest that the onset of reading instruction coincides with an increase in neural responsiveness to phoneme-rate modulations, and that the extent of this increase is related to (the outcome of) reading development. Hereby, dyslexic children persistently demonstrate atypically high neural synchronization to phoneme rates from the beginning of reading acquisition onwards.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Reading deficits in schizophrenia and their relationship to developmental dyslexia: A review.Although schizophrenia and developmental dyslexia are considered distinct disorders in terms of clinical presentation and functional outcome, they both involve disruption in the processes that support skilled reading, including language, auditory perception, visual perception, oculomotor control, and executive function. Further, recent work has proposed a common neurodevelopmental basis for the two disorders, as suggested by genetic and pathophysiological overlap. Thus, these lines of research suggest that reading may be similarly impacted in schizophrenia and dyslexia. In this review, we survey research on reading abilities in individuals with schizophrenia, and review the potential mechanisms underlying reading deficits in schizophrenia that may be shared with those implicated in dyslexia. Elucidating the relationship between reading impairment in schizophrenia and dyslexia could allow for a better understanding of the pathophysiological underpinnings of schizophrenia, and could facilitate remediation of cognitive deficits that impact day-to-day functioning.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Alexia Without Agraphia: A Rare Entity.Pure alexia refers to an acquired disorder associated with the damage to medial occipitotemporal gyrus in the dominant hemisphere, which is also known as visual word form area (VWFA). VWFA is involved in rapid word recognition and fluent reading. Alexia without agraphia is a disconnection syndrome that occurs when the splenium is also damaged with the occipital lobe on a dominant side. We report a case of a 72-year-old right-handed male who presented with alexia without agraphia accompanied by right homonymous hemianopia resulting from acute infarct of the left occipital lobe, the splenium of the corpus callosum and posterior thalamus that probably occurred on the previous day. During the evaluation, he exhibited marked impairment in the ability to read with the vision being grossly normal. Magnetic resonant imaging (MRI) revealed an acute infarct of the left occipital lobe, the splenium of the corpus callosum and posterior thalamus. A computerized tomography angiogram (CTA) revealed left posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory infarct without any evidence of hemorrhagic conversion. Infarction of the occipital lobe on the dominant side (left) in a right-handed individual may cause a disruption in the visual word form area and is manifested by an inability to read with no abnormalities in visual acuity.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Exploring the Link between Visual Perception, Visual-Motor Integration, and Reading in Normal Developing and Impaired Children using DTVP-2.Reading is known to be primarily a linguistic task. However, to successfully decode written words, children also need to develop good visual-perception skills. Furthermore, motor skills are implicated in letter recognition and reading acquisition. Three studies have been designed to determine the link between reading, visual perception, and visual-motor integration using the Developmental Test of Visual Perception version 2 (DTVP-2). Study 1 tests how visual perception and visual-motor integration in kindergarten predict reading outcomes in Grade 1, in typical developing children. Study 2 is aimed at finding out if these skills can be seen as clinical markers in dyslexic children (DD). Study 3 determines if visual-motor integration and motor-reduced visual perception can distinguish DD children according to whether they exhibit or not developmental coordination disorder (DCD). Results showed that phonological awareness and visual-motor integration predicted reading outcomes one year later. DTVP-2 demonstrated similarities and differences in visual-motor integration and motor-reduced visual perception between children with DD, DCD, and both of these deficits. DTVP-2 is a suitable tool to investigate links between visual perception, visual-motor integration and reading, and to differentiate cognitive profiles of children with developmental disabilities (i.e. DD, DCD, and comorbid children).

      "ABSTRACT Response to Intervention as a Predictor of Long-Term Reading Outcomes in Children with Dyslexia.The goal of this study was to investigate how growth during a phonics-based intervention, as well as reading levels at baseline testing, predicted long-term reading outcomes of children with dyslexia. Eighty Dutch children with dyslexia who had completed a 50-week phonics-based intervention in grade 4 were tested in grade 5 on both word and pseudoword (following regular Dutch orthographic patterns) reading efficiency and compared to 93 typical readers. In grade 5 the children with dyslexia were still significantly slower in word and pseudoword reading than their typically developing peers. Results showed that long-term pseudoword reading in the group with dyslexia was predicted by pseudoword reading at pretest and growth in pseudoword reading during the intervention, which was itself predicted by pseudoword reading at pretest. This was not the case for word reading. We found that long-term word reading was directly predicted from pretest word reading, and indirectly via pretest pseudoword reading, via growth in pseudoword and word reading. It can be concluded that pseudoword reading is not only a good indicator of severity of reading difficulties in children with dyslexia, it is also an indicator of who will profit from intervention in the long-term.

      "ABSTRACT What Reading Disability? Evidence for Multiple Latent Profiles of Struggling Readers in a Large Russian Sibpair Sample With at Least One Sibling at Risk for Reading Difficulties.In this study, we performed a latent profile analysis of reading and related skills in a large ( n = 733) sibpair sample of Russian readers at risk for reading difficulties. The analysis suggested the presence of seven latent profiles, of which two were characterized by relatively high performance on measures of spelling and reading comprehension and the remaining five included severely as well as moderately affected readers with deficits in the domains of phonological, orthographic, and morphological processing. The results suggest that the development and manifestation of reading difficulties in Russian is mappable on a complex pattern of interactions between different types and severities of processing deficits. The results point to the psychological reality of multiple different suboptimal patterns of deficits in reading and reading-related skills and support the multifactorial view of the disorder, with intriguing implications for future neurobiological studies.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Reading related white matter structures in adolescents are influenced more by dysregulation of emotion than behavior.Mood disorders and behavioral are broad psychiatric diagnostic categories that have different symptoms and neurobiological mechanisms, but share some neurocognitive similarities, one of which is an elevated risk for reading deficit. Our aim was to determine the influence of mood versus behavioral dysregulation on reading ability and neural correlates supporting these skills in youth, using diffusion tensor imaging in 11- to 17-year-old children and youths with mood disorders or behavioral disorders and age-matched healthy controls. The three groups differed only in phonological processing and passage comprehension. Youth with mood disorders scored higher on the phonological test but had lower comprehension scores than children with behavioral disorders and controls; control participants scored the highest. Correlations between fractional anisotropy and phonological processing in the left Arcuate Fasciculus showed a significant difference between groups and were strongest in behavioral disorders, intermediate in mood disorders, and lowest in controls. Correlations between these measures in the left Inferior Longitudinal Fasciculus were significantly greater than in controls for mood but not for behavioral disorders. Youth with mood disorders share a deficit in the executive-limbic pathway (Arcuate Fasciculus) with behavioral-disordered youth, suggesting reduced capacity for engaging frontal regions for phonological processing or passage comprehension tasks and increased reliance on the ventral tract (e.g., the Inferior Longitudinal Fasciculus). The low passage comprehension scores in mood disorder may result from engaging the left hemisphere. Neural pathways for reading differ mainly in executive-limbic circuitry. This new insight may aid clinicians in providing appropriate intervention for each disorder.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Developmental surface and phonological dyslexia in both Greek and English.The hallmark of developmental surface dyslexia in English and French is inaccurate reading of words with atypical spelling-sound correspondences. According to Douklias, Masterson and Hanley (2009), surface dyslexia can also be observed in Greek (a transparent orthography for reading that does not contain words of this kind). Their findings suggested that surface dyslexia in Greek can be characterized by slow reading of familiar words, and by inaccurate spelling of words with atypical sound-spelling correspondences (Greek is less transparent for spelling than for reading). In this study, we report seven adult cases whose slow reading and impaired spelling accuracy satisfied these criteria for Greek surface dyslexia. When asked to read words with atypical grapheme-phoneme correspondences in English (their second language), their accuracy was severely impaired. A co-occurrence was also observed between impaired spelling of words with atypical phoneme-grapheme correspondences in English and Greek. These co-occurrences provide strong evidence that surface dyslexia genuinely exists in Greek and that slow reading of real words in Greek reflects the same underlying impairment as that which produces inaccurate reading of atypical words in English. Two further individuals were observed with impaired reading and spelling of nonwords in both languages, consistent with developmental phonological dyslexia. Neither of the phonological dyslexics read words slowly. In terms of computational models of reading aloud, these findings suggest that slow reading by dyslexics in transparent orthographies is the consequence of a developmental impairment of the lexical (Coltheart, Rastle, Perry, Langdon, & Zeigler, 2001; Perry, Ziegler, & Zorzi, 2010) or semantic reading route (Plaut, McClelland, Seidenberg, & Patterson, 1996). This outcome provides evidence that the neurophysiological substrate(s) that support the lexical/semantic and the phonological pathways that are involved in reading and spelling are the same in both Greek and English.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Cortical responses to tone and phoneme mismatch as a predictor of dyslexia? A systematic review.Evidence from event-related-potential (ERP) studies has repeatedly shown differences in the perception and processing of auditory stimuli in children with dyslexia compared to control children. The mismatch negativity (MMN) - an ERP component reflecting passive auditory change detection ability - has been found to be reduced, not only in children with a diagnosis of dyslexia, but also in infants and preschool children at risk of developing dyslexia. However, the results are controversial due to the different methods, age of the children and stimuli used. The aim of the present review is to summarize and evaluate the MMN research about at-risk children in order to identify risk factors that discriminate between children with and without dyslexia risk and to analyze if the MMR (the abbreviation refers to positive and negative mismatch responses) correlates with later reading and spelling ability. A literature search yielded 17 studies reporting MMR to speech or non-speech stimuli in children at risk of dyslexia. The results of the studies were inconsistent. Studies measuring speech MMR often found attenuated amplitudes in the at-risk group, but mainly in very young children. The results for older children (6-7years) and for non-speech stimuli are more heterogeneous. A moderate positive correlation of MMR amplitude size with later reading and spelling abilities was consistently found. Overall, the findings of this review indicate that the MMR can be a valuable part of early dyslexia identification, which can enable efficient support and intervention for a child before the first problems appear.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Reading network in dyslexia: Similar, yet different.Dyslexia is a developmental disorder characterized by reading and phonological difficulties, yet important questions remain regarding its underlying neural correlates. In this study, we used partial least squares (PLS), a multivariate analytic technique, to investigate the neural networks used by dyslexics while performing a word-rhyming task. Although the overall reading network was largely similar in dyslexics and typical readers, it did not correlate with behavior in the same way in the two groups. In particular, there was a positive association between reading performance and both right superior temporal gyrus and bilateral insula activation in dyslexic readers but a negative correlation in typical readers. Together with differences in lateralization unique to dyslexics, this suggests that the combination of poor reading performance with high insula activity and atypical laterality is a consistent marker of dyslexia. These findings emphasize the importance of understanding right-hemisphere activation in dyslexia and provide promising directions for the remediation of reading disorders.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Neural stability: A reflection of automaticity in reading.Automaticity, the ability to perform a task rapidly with minimal effort, plays a key role in reading fluency and is indexed by rapid automatized naming (RAN) and processing speed. Yet little is known about automaticity's neurophysiologic underpinnings. The more efficiently sound is encoded, the more automatic sound processing can be. In turn, this automaticity could free up cognitive resources such as attention and working memory to help build an integrative reading network. Therefore, we hypothesized that automaticity and reading fluency correlate with stable neural representation of sounds, given a larger body of literature suggesting the close relationship between neural stability and the integrative function in the central auditory system. To test this hypothesis, we recorded the frequency-following responses (FFR) to speech syllables and administered cognitive and reading measures to school-aged children. We show that the stability of neural responses to speech correlates with RAN and processing speed, but not phonological awareness. Moreover, the link between neural stability and RAN mediates the previously-determined link between neural stability and reading ability. Children with a RAN deficit have especially unstable neural responses. Our neurophysiological approach illuminates a potential neural mechanism specific to RAN, which in turn indicates a relationship between synchronous neural firing in the auditory system and automaticity critical for reading fluency.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The DCDC2 deletion is not a risk factor for dyslexia.Dyslexia is a specific impairment in learning to read and has strong heritability. An intronic deletion within the DCDC2 gene, with ~8% frequency in European populations, is increasingly used as a marker for dyslexia in neuroimaging and behavioral studies. At a mechanistic level, this deletion has been proposed to influence sensory processing capacity, and in particular sensitivity to visual coherent motion. Our re-assessment of the literature, however, did not reveal strong support for a role of this specific deletion in dyslexia. We also analyzed data from five distinct cohorts, enriched for individuals with dyslexia, and did not identify any signal indicative of associations for the DCDC2 deletion with reading-related measures, including in a combined sample analysis (N=526). We believe we conducted the first replication analysis for a proposed deletion effect on visual motion perception and found no association (N=445 siblings). We also report that the DCDC2 deletion has a frequency of 37.6% in a cohort representative of the general population recruited in Hong Kong (N=220). This figure, together with a lack of association between the deletion and reading abilities in this cohort, indicates the low likelihood of a direct deletion effect on reading skills. Therefore, on the basis of multiple strands of evidence, we conclude that the DCDC2 deletion is not a strong risk factor for dyslexia. Our analyses and literature re-evaluation are important for interpreting current developments within multidisciplinary studies of dyslexia and, more generally, contribute to current discussions about the importance of reproducibility in science.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Slowing in reading and picture naming: the effects of aging and developmental dyslexia.We examined the slowing in vocal reaction times shown by dyslexic (compared to control) children with that of older (compared to younger) adults using an approach focusing on the detection of global, non-task-specific components. To address this aim, data were analyzed with reference to the difference engine (DEM) and rate and amount (RAM) models. In Experiment 1, typically developing children, children with dyslexia (both attending sixth grade), younger adults and older adults read words and non-words and named pictures. In Experiment 2, word and picture conditions were presented to dyslexic and control children attending eighth grade. In both experiments, dyslexic children were delayed in reading conditions, while they were unimpaired in naming pictures (a finding which indicates spared access to the phonological lexicon). The reading difficulty was well accounted for by a single multiplicative factor while only the residual effect of length (but not frequency and lexicality) was present after controlling for over-additivity using a linear mixed effects model with random slopes on critical variables. Older adults were slower than younger adults across reading and naming conditions. This deficit was well described by a single multiplicative factor. Thus, while slowing of information processing is limited to orthographic stimuli in dyslexic children, it cuts across verbal tasks in older adults. Overall, speed differences in groups such as dyslexic children and older adults can be effectively described with reference to deficits in domains encompassing a variety of experimental conditions rather than deficits in single specific task/conditions. The DEM and RAM prove effective in teasing out global vs. specific components of performance.\n",

Among those 164 children, 15 had been diagnosed as having dyslexia by professional psychologists, and 15 other children manifested average reading ability and had been randomly selected from the sample for comparison. All children were administered a battery of tasks including Chinese character recognition, word dictation, morphological awareness, phonological awareness and rapid automatized naming. Multivariate analysis of variance and predictive discriminate analysis were performed to examine whether the dyslexic children showed differences in the cognitive-linguistic tasks in comparison with controls. Results suggested that the dyslexic groups had poorer performance in morphological awareness and RAN across all 3 years. However, phonological awareness was not stable in distinguishing the groups. Findings suggest that morphological awareness is a relatively strong correlate of spelling difficulties in Chinese, but phonological awareness is not. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Neural Entrainment and Sensorimotor Synchronization to the Beat in Children with Developmental Dyslexia: An EEG Study.Tapping in time to a metronome beat (hereafter beat synchronization) shows considerable variability in child populations, and individual differences in beat synchronization are reliably related to reading development. Children with developmental dyslexia show impairments in beat synchronization. These impairments may reflect deficiencies in auditory perception of the beat which in turn affect auditory-motor mapping, or may reflect an independent motor deficit. Here, we used a new methodology in EEG based on measuring beat-related steady-state evoked potentials (SS-EPs, Nozaradan et al., 2015) in an attempt to disentangle neural sensory and motor contributions to behavioral beat synchronization in children with dyslexia. Children tapped with both their left and right hands to every second beat of a metronome pulse delivered at 2.4 Hz, or listened passively to the beat. Analyses of preferred phase in EEG showed that the children with dyslexia had a significantly different preferred phase compared to control children in all conditions. Regarding SS-EPs, the groups differed significantly for the passive Auditory listening condition at 2.4 Hz, and showed a trend toward a difference in the Right hand tapping condition at 3.6 Hz (sensorimotor integration measure). The data suggest that neural rhythmic entrainment is atypical in children with dyslexia for both an auditory beat and during sensorimotor coupling (tapping). The data are relevant to a growing literature suggesting that rhythm-based interventions may help language processing in children with developmental disorders of language learning.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Neurobiological bases of reading disorder Part I: Etiological investigations.While many studies have focused on identifying the neural and behavioral characteristics of decoding-based reading disorder (RD, aka developmental dyslexia), the etiology of RD remains largely unknown and understudied. Because the brain plays an intermediate role between genetic factors and behavioral outcomes, it is promising to address causality from a neural perspective. In the current, Part I of the two-part review, we discuss neuroimaging approaches to addressing the causality issue and review the results of studies that have employed these approaches. We assume that if a neural signature were associated with RD etiology, it would (a) manifest across comparisons in different languages, (b) be experience independent and appear in comparisons between RD and reading-matched controls, (c) be present both pre- and post-intervention, (d) be found in at-risk, pre-reading children and (e) be associated with genetic risk. We discuss each of these five characteristics in turn and summarize the studies that have examined each of them. The available literature provides evidence that anomalies in left temporo-parietal cortex, and possibly occipito-temporal cortex, may be closely related to the etiology of RD. Improved understanding of the etiology of RD can help improve the accuracy of early detection and enable targeted intervention of cognitive processes that are amenable to change, leading to improved outcomes in at-risk or affected populations.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Neuroanatomy of developmental dyslexia: Pitfalls and promise.Investigations into the neuroanatomical bases of developmental dyslexia have now spanned more than 40 years, starting with the post-mortem examination of a few individual brains in the 60s and 70s, and exploding in the 90s with the widespread use of MRI. The time is now ripe to reappraise the considerable amount of data gathered with MRI using different types of sequences (T1, diffusion, spectroscopy) and analysed using different methods (manual, voxel-based or surface-based morphometry, fractional anisotropy and tractography, multivariate analyses…). While selective reviews of mostly small-scale studies seem to provide a coherent view of the brain disruptions that are typical of dyslexia, involving left perisylvian and occipito-temporal regions, we argue that this view may be deceptive and that meta-analyses and large-scale studies rather highlight many inconsistencies and limitations. We discuss problems inherent to small sample size as well as methodological difficulties that still undermine the discovery of reliable neuroanatomical bases of dyslexia, and we outline some recommendations to further improve this research area.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Characteristics of Chinese-English bilingual dyslexia in right occipito-temporal lesion.Current literature suggests that right hemisphere lesions produce predominant spatial-related dyslexic error in English speakers. However, little is known regarding such lesions in Chinese speakers. In this paper, we describe the dyslexic characteristics of a Chinese-English bilingual patient with a right posterior cortical lesion. He was found to have profound spatial-related errors during his English word reading, in both real and non-words. During Chinese word reading, there was significantly less error compared to English, probably due to the ideographic nature of the Chinese language. He was also found to commit phonological-like visual errors in English, characterized by error responses that were visually similar to the actual word. There was no significant difference in visual errors during English word reading compared with Chinese. In general, our patient's performance in both languages appears to be consistent with the current literature on right posterior hemisphere lesions. Additionally, his performance also likely suggests that the right posterior cortical region participates in the visual analysis of orthographical word representation, both in ideographical and alphabetic languages, at least from a bilingual perspective. Future studies should further examine the role of the right posterior region in initial visual analysis of both languages.\n",

      "ABSTRACT RADAR: A novel fast-screening method for reading difficulties with special focus on dyslexia.Dyslexia is a developmental learning disorder of single word reading accuracy and/or fluency, with compelling research directed towards understanding the contributions of the visual system. While dyslexia is not an oculomotor disease, readers with dyslexia have shown different eye movements than typically developing students during text reading. Readers with dyslexia exhibit longer and more frequent fixations, shorter saccade lengths, more backward refixations than typical readers. Furthermore, readers with dyslexia are known to have difficulty in reading long words, lower skipping rate of short words, and high gaze duration on many words. It is an open question whether it is possible to harness these distinctive oculomotor scanning patterns observed during reading in order to develop a screening tool that can reliably identify struggling readers, who may be candidates for dyslexia. Here, we introduce a novel, fast, objective, non-invasive method, named Rapid Assessment of Difficulties and Abnormalities in Reading (RADAR) that screens for features associated with the aberrant visual scanning of reading text seen in dyslexia. Eye tracking parameter measurements that are stable under retest and have high discriminative power, as indicated by their ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curves, were obtained during silent text reading. These parameters were combined to derive a total reading score (TRS) that can reliably separate readers with dyslexia from typical readers. We tested TRS in a group of school-age children ranging from 8.5 to 12.5 years of age. TRS achieved 94.2% correct classification of children tested. Specifically, 35 out of 37 control (specificity 94.6%) and 30 out of 32 readers with dyslexia (sensitivity 93.8%) were classified correctly using RADAR, under a circular validation condition (see section Results/Total Reading Score) where the individual evaluated was not included in the test construction group. In conclusion, RADAR is a novel, automated, fast and reliable way to identify children at high risk of dyslexia that is amenable to large-scale screening. Moreover, analysis of eye movement parameters obtained with RADAR during reading will likely be useful for implementing individualized treatment strategies and for monitoring objectively the success of chosen interventions. We envision that it will be possible to use RADAR as a sensitive, objective, and quantitative first pass screen to identify individuals with reading disorders that manifest with abnormal oculomotor reading strategies, like dyslexia.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Improvements in reading accuracy as a result of increased interletter spacing are not specific to children with dyslexia.Recently, increased interletter spacing (LS) has been studied as a way to enhance reading fluency. It is suggested that increased LS improves reading performance, especially in poor readers. Theoretically, these findings are well substantiated as a result of diminished crowding effects. Empirically, however, findings on LS are inconclusive. In two experiments, we examined whether effects of increased LS are specific to children with dyslexia and whether increased LS affects word or sentence processing. In the first experiment, 30 children with dyslexia and 30 controls (mean age=9years 11months) read sentences in standard and increased LS conditions. In the second experiment, these sentences were read by an unselected sample of 189 readers (mean age=9years 3months) in either a sentence or word-by-word reading condition. The first experiment showed that increased LS affected children with dyslexia and controls in similar ways. Participants made fewer errors in the increased LS condition than in the standard LS condition. Reading rates were not affected. There were no indications that the effect of LS was related to reading ability, not even for a subgroup of readers. Findings of the second experiment were similar. Increased LS resulted in fewer errors, not faster reading rates. This was found only when complete sentences were presented, not when sentences were read word by word. Three main conclusions can be drawn. First, increased LS appears to affect reading accuracy only. Second, the findings do not support claims that increased LS specifically affects poor readers. And third, the effect of LS seems to occur at the interword level. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Early dynamics of white matter deficits in children developing dyslexia.Neural anomalies have been demonstrated in dyslexia. Recent studies in pre-readers at risk for dyslexia and in pre-readers developing poor reading suggest that these anomalies might be a cause of their reading impairment. Our study goes one step further by exploring the neurodevelopmental trajectory of white matter anomalies in pre-readers with and without a familial risk for dyslexia (n=61) of whom a strictly selected sample develops dyslexia later on (n=15). We collected longitudinal diffusion MRI and behavioural data until grade 3. The results provide evidence that children with dyslexia exhibit pre-reading white matter anomalies in left and right long segment of the arcuate fasciculus (AF), with predictive power of the left segment above traditional cognitive measures and familial risk. Whereas white matter differences in the left AF seem most strongly related to the development of dyslexia, differences in the left IFOF and in the right AF seem driven by both familial risk and later reading ability. Moreover, differences in the left AF appeared to be dynamic. This study supports and expands recent insights into the neural basis of dyslexia, pointing towards pre-reading anomalies related to dyslexia, as well as underpinning the dynamic character of white matter.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Acquired epileptic opercular syndrome related to a heterozygous deleterious substitution in GRIN2A.Epileptic encephalopathies with continuous spike-and-waves during sleep (CSWS) are characterized by cognitive or language impairment, and are occasionally associated with pathogenic variants of the GRIN2A gene. In these disorders, speech dysfunction could be either related to cerebral dysfunction caused by the GRIN2A deleterious variant or intense interictal epileptic activity. Here, we present a patient with apraxia of speech, clearly linked to severity of epilepsy, carrying a GRIN2A variant. A 6-year-old boy developed acute regression of expressive language following epileptic seizures, leading to complete mutism, at which time EEG revealed CSWS. MEG showed bilateral superior parietal and opercular independent CSWS onsets and PET with fluorodeoxyglucose demonstrated significant increase in relative glucose metabolism in bilateral superior parietal regions. Corticosteroids induced a regression of CSWS together with impressive improvement in speech abilities. This case supports the hypothesis of a triggering role for epileptic discharges in speech deterioration observed in children carrying a deleterious variant of GRIN2A. When classic antiepileptic drugs fail to control epileptic activity, corticosteroids should be considered. Multimodal functional neuroimaging suggests a role for opercular and superior parietal areas in acquired epileptic opercular syndrome.

Reduced measures of neurobiological functioning related to reading (dis)ability, i.e. endophenotypes (EPs), are promising targets for gene finding and the elucidation of the underlying mechanisms. In a sample of 100 nuclear families with DD (229 offspring) and 83 unrelated typical readers, we tested whether a set of well-established, cognitive phenotypes related to DD [i.e. rapid auditory processing (RAP), rapid automatized naming (RAN), multisensory nonspatial attention and visual motion processing] fulfilled the criteria of the EP construct. Visual motion and RAP satisfied all testable criteria (i.e. they are heritable, associate with the disorder, co-segregate with the disorder within a family and represent reproducible measures) and are therefore solid EPs of DD. Multisensory nonspatial attention satisfied three of four criteria (i.e. it associates with the disorder, co-segregates with the disorder within a family and represents a reproducible measure) and is therefore a potential EP for DD. Rapid automatized naming is heritable but does not meet other criteria of the EP construct. We provide the first evidence of a methodologically and statistically sound approach for identifying EPs for DD to be exploited as a solid alternative basis to clinical phenotypes in neuroscience.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Visual agnosia and focal brain injury.Visual agnosia encompasses all disorders of visual recognition within a selective visual modality not due to an impairment of elementary visual processing or other cognitive deficit. Based on a sequential dichotomy between the perceptual and memory systems, two different categories of visual object agnosia are usually considered: 'apperceptive agnosia' and 'associative agnosia'. Impaired visual recognition within a single category of stimuli is also reported in: (i) visual object agnosia of the ventral pathway, such as prosopagnosia (for faces), pure alexia (for words), or topographagnosia (for landmarks); (ii) visual spatial agnosia of the dorsal pathway, such as cerebral akinetopsia (for movement), or orientation agnosia (for the placement of objects in space). Focal brain injuries provide a unique opportunity to better understand regional brain function, particularly with the use of effective statistical approaches such as voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM). The aim of the present work was twofold: (i) to review the various agnosia categories according to the traditional visual dual-pathway model; and (ii) to better assess the anatomical network underlying visual recognition through lesion-mapping studies correlating neuroanatomical and clinical outcomes.\n",

Out of 148 total individual missense variants identified, the chromosome 7 genes CCDC136 and FLNC contained 19. In addition, a region corresponding to the well-known DYX2 locus for RD contained 74 missense variants. Both allele sets were filtered for a minor allele frequency ≤0.01 and high Polyphen-2 scores. To determine if observations of these alleles are occurring more frequently in our cases than expected by chance in aggregate, counts from our sample were compared to the number of observations in the European subset of the 1000 Genomes Project using Fisher's exact test. Significant P values were achieved for both CCDC136/FLNC (P = 0.0098) and the DYX2 locus (P = 0.012).

The method aims to identify the essential functional connections to ensure optimal information flow via the objective criterion of global efficiency minus the cost of surviving connections.

Weighted interactions between network nodes (sensors) were computed using an integrated approach of dominant intrinsic coupling modes based on two alternative metrics (symbolic mutual information and phase lag index), resulting in excellent discrimination of individual cases according to their group membership.

      "ABSTRACT Lexical decision performance in developmental surface dysgraphia: Evidence for a unitary orthographic system that is used in both reading and spelling.The relationship between spelling, written word recognition, and picture naming is investigated in a study of seven bilingual adults who have developmental surface dysgraphia in both Greek (their first language) and English (their second language). Four of the cases also performed poorly at orthographic lexical decision in both languages. This finding is consistent with similar results in Italian that have been taken as evidence of a developmental impairment to a single orthographic system that is used for both reading and spelling. The remaining three participants performed well at orthographic lexical decision. At first sight, preserved lexical decision in surface dysgraphia is less easy to explain in terms of a shared orthographic system. However, the results of subsequent experiments showed clear parallels between the nature of the reading and spelling difficulties that these three individuals experienced, consistent with the existence of a single orthographic system. The different patterns that were observed were consistent with the claims of Friedmann and Lukov (2008. Developmental surface dyslexias. Cortex, 44, 1146-1160) that several distinct sub-types of developmental surface dyslexia exist. We show that individual differences in spelling in surface dysgraphia are also consistent with these sub-types; there are different developmental deficits that can give rise, in an individual, to a combination of surface dyslexia and dysgraphia. Finally, we compare the theoretical framework used by Friedmann and her colleagues that is based upon the architecture of the DRC model with an account that relies instead upon the Triangle model of reading].\n",

      "ABSTRACT Morphology and Spelling in French: A Comparison of At-Risk Readers and Typically Developing Children.We present two studies that examine the role of morphology in French spelling. In Study 1, we examined the concurrent and longitudinal relationships between inflectional awareness and derivational awareness and spelling within a sample of 77 children in a French immersion programme in Canada. Children completed a non-verbal reasoning measure and French measures of phonological awareness, word reading, vocabulary, morphological awareness, and spelling. Results showed that inflectional morphological awareness in Grade 3 was a predictor of spelling in the same grade. Inflectional awareness in Grade 2 predicted Grade 3 spelling, controlling for reading-related skills and spelling at Grade 2. These analyses support the role of inflectional morphological awareness in the development of spelling of children of a range of reading and spelling abilities. In contrast, derivational awareness in Grades 2 and 3 did not predict spelling concurrently in both grades respectively. Study 2 contrasted the morphological errors in the spellings of six children at risk for reading difficulties with those of six chronological age-matched and six reading level-matched children. Analyses showed that at-risk children exhibited more difficulties with spelling roots and suffixes in words as compared with their age-matched peers, although they performed similarly to children matched on reading level.

      "ABSTRACT What can Parents' Self-report of Reading Difficulties Tell Us about Their Children's Emergent Literacy at School Entry?Research has linked family risk (FR) of reading difficulties (RD) with children's difficulties in emergent literacy development. This study is the first to apply parents' self-report of RD as a proxy for FR in a large sample (n = 1171) in order to test group differences in children's emergent literacy. Emergent literacy, the home literacy environment and children's interest in literacy and letters were compared across different groups of FR children around the school entry. The FR children performed lower in emergent literacy compared with not-FR children. Furthermore, when comparing FR children with one parent reporting RD and children with both parents reporting RD, moderate group differences were found in Emergent Literacy. Finally, parents' self-report of RD was a significant contributor of emergent literacy after controlling for the home literacy environment, children's gender, their interest in literacy and letters, months in kindergarten, vocabulary and parents' education. Our findings suggest that schools should monitor the reading development of children with parents self-reporting RD closely - especially if both parents self-report RD. © 2017 The Authors.

      "ABSTRACT Towards identifying dyslexia in Standard Indonesian: the development of a reading assessment battery.With its transparent orthography, Standard Indonesian is spoken by over 160 million inhabitants and is the primary language of instruction in education and the government in Indonesia. An assessment battery of reading and reading-related skills was developed as a starting point for the diagnosis of dyslexia in beginner learners. Founded on the International Dyslexia Association's definition of dyslexia, the test battery comprises nine empirically motivated reading and reading-related tasks assessing word reading, pseudoword reading, arithmetic, rapid automatized naming, phoneme deletion, forward and backward digit span, verbal fluency, orthographic choice (spelling), and writing. The test was validated by computing the relationships between the outcomes on the reading-skills and reading-related measures by means of correlation and factor analyses. External variables, i.e., school grades and teacher ratings of the reading and learning abilities of individual students, were also utilized to provide evidence of its construct validity. Four variables were found to be significantly related with reading-skill measures: phonological awareness, rapid naming, spelling, and digit span. The current study on reading development in Standard Indonesian confirms findings from other languages with transparent orthographies and suggests a test battery including preliminary norm scores for screening and assessment of elementary school children learning to read Standard Indonesian.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Face and Word Recognition Can Be Selectively Affected by Brain Injury or Developmental Disorders.Face and word recognition have traditionally been thought to rely on highly specialised and relatively independent cognitive processes. Some of the strongest evidence for this has come from patients with seemingly category-specific visual perceptual deficits such as pure prosopagnosia, a selective face recognition deficit, and pure alexia, a selective word recognition deficit. Together, the patterns of impaired reading with preserved face recognition and impaired face recognition with preserved reading constitute a double dissociation. The existence of these selective deficits has been questioned over the past decade. It has been suggested that studies describing patients with these pure deficits have failed to measure the supposedly preserved functions using sensitive enough measures, and that if tested using sensitive measurements, all patients with deficits in one visual category would also have deficits in the other. The implications of this would be immense, with most textbooks in cognitive neuropsychology requiring drastic revisions. In order to evaluate the evidence for dissociations, we review studies that specifically investigate whether face or word recognition can be selectively affected by acquired brain injury or developmental disorders. We only include studies published since 2004, as comprehensive reviews of earlier studies are available. Most of the studies assess the supposedly preserved functions using sensitive measurements. We found convincing evidence that reading can be preserved in acquired and developmental prosopagnosia and also evidence (though weaker) that face recognition can be preserved in acquired or developmental dyslexia, suggesting that face and word recognition are at least in part supported by independent processes.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Relationships between Eye Movements during Sentence Reading Comprehension, Word Spelling and Reading, and DTI and fmri Connectivity In Students with and without Dysgraphia or Dyslexia.While eye movements were recorded and brains scanned, 29 children with and without specific learning disabilities (SLDs) decided if sentences they read (half with only correctly spelled words and half with homonym foils) were meaningful. Significant main effects were found for diagnostic groups (non-SLD control, dysgraphia control, and dyslexia) in total fixation (dwell) time, total number of fixations, and total regressions in during saccades; the dyslexia group had longer and more fixations and made more regressions in during saccades than either control group. The dyslexia group also differed from both control groups in (a) fractional anisotropy in left optic radiation and (b) silent word reading fluency on a task in which surrounding letters can be distracting, consistent with Rayner's selective attention dyslexia model. Different profiles for non-SLD control, dysgraphia, and dyslexia groups were identified in correlations between total fixation time, total number of fixations, regressions in during saccades, magnitude of gray matter connectivity during the fMRI sentence reading comprehension from left occipital temporal cortex seed with right BA44 and from left inferior frontal gyrus with right inferior frontoccipital fasciculus, and normed word-specific spelling and silent word reading fluency measures. The dysgraphia group was more likely than the non-SLD control or dyslexia groups to show negative correlations between eye movement outcomes and sentences containing incorrect homonym foils. Findings are discussed in reference to a systems approach in future sentence reading comprehension research that integrates eye movement, brain, and literacy measures.\n",

Here, we draw special attention to dyslexia, a common but often underdiagnosed LD. Reading and learning problems commonly associated with dyslexia are often masked by protective factors, such as high verbal ability or general intelligence. Hence, high-achieving individuals with dyslexia may not be identified as being in a high-risk category. To ensure that students with dyslexia are included in LD concussion research and identified as LD in baseline testing, we provide athletic trainers with an overview of dyslexia and a preliminary screening protocol that is sensitive to dyslexia, even among academically high-achieving students in secondary school and college.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Do prereaders' auditory processing and speech perception predict later literacy?Developmental dyslexia has frequently been linked to deficits in auditory processing and speech perception. However, the presence and precise nature of these deficits and the direction of their relation with reading, remains debated. In this longitudinal study, 87 five-year-olds at high and low family risk for dyslexia were followed before and during different stages of reading acquisition. The processing of different auditory cues was investigated, together with performance on speech perception and phonology and reading. Results show no effect of family risk for dyslexia on prereading auditory processing and speech perception skills. However, a relation is present between the performance on these skills in kindergarten and later phonology and literacy. In particular, links are found with the auditory processing of cues characteristic for the temporal speech amplitude envelope, rather than with other auditory cues important for speech intelligibility. Hereby, cues embedded in the speech amplitude envelope show to be related to a broad range of phonological precursors for reading. In addition, speech-in-noise perception demonstrates to operate as the most contributing factor for later phonological awareness and to be a predictor for reading mediated by the association with phonology. This study provides behavioral support for the link between prereading speech amplitude envelope processing and speech perception for future phonology and reading.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Reading difficulties and the pediatric ophthalmologist.Approximately 20% of children have dyslexia, a language-based reading disability. A variation in language processing in the brain leads to a deficit in phonological (auditory) processing, which leads to problems in learning to read, write, and spell. Myths continue to exist regarding dyslexia and vision, and although eye and vision problems may coexist with dyslexia, they are not more prevalent than in the general population. Rarely vision problems may make reading at near very difficult and may masquerade as a learning problem or attention deficit disorder/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The pediatric ophthalmologist can play a valuable role in determining whether any eye or vision problems exist that might interfere with learning or reading. Treatments to improve these eye conditions may help make reading more comfortable, but they are not a therapy for coexisting dyslexia. The use of vision therapy has never been shown scientifically to be effective and may prevent the application of effective interventions during the critical period of development when reading disorders can best be remediated. The pediatric ophthalmologist should educate parents about reading and dyslexia and provide prompt referral to professionals who have expertise in evaluating and treating learning disabilities.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Six factors of adult dyslexia assessed by cognitive tests and self-report questions: Very high predictive validity.The Multiple Diagnostic Digital Dyslexia Test for Adults (MDDDT-A) consists of 12 newly developed tests and self-report questions in the Dutch language. Predictive validity and construct validity were investigated and compared with validity of a standard test battery of dyslexia (STB) in a sample of 154 students. There are three main results. First, various analyses of principal components showed that six or more factors of dyslexia can be distinguished (rapid naming, spelling, reading, short-term memory, confusion, phonology, attention, complexity). All factors are represented by the MDDDT-A. Second, various discriminant analyses showed good predictive validity for both the tests of the MDDDT-A (90%) and the STB (90%). However, predictive validity of the questionnaire was highest (97%). Third, we analysed the best predictors of dyslexia and found that predictive validity is higher when construct validity is high, that is when a set of predictors represents many characteristics of dyslexia. The main conclusion is that a digital test battery can be a reliable screening instrument for dyslexia in students, especially when it is accompanied by self-report questions. A theoretical conclusion is that dyslexia is characterized by at least six cognitive impairments in a complex way. In students, this structure may be modulated by high intelligence and good schooling through various compensation strategies. It is therefore recommended to include assessments of all characteristics of dyslexia to achieve the most reliable diagnoses in different samples and in different countries.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Knockout Mice for Dyslexia Susceptibility Gene Homologs KIAA0319 and KIAA0319L have Unaffected Neuronal Migration but Display Abnormal Auditory Processing.Developmental dyslexia is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects reading ability caused by genetic and non-genetic factors. Amongst the susceptibility genes identified to date, KIAA0319 is a prime candidate. RNA-interference experiments in rats suggested its involvement in cortical migration but we could not confirm these findings in Kiaa0319-mutant mice. Given its homologous gene Kiaa0319L (AU040320) has also been proposed to play a role in neuronal migration, we interrogated whether absence of AU040320 alone or together with KIAA0319 affects migration in the developing brain. Analyses of AU040320 and double Kiaa0319;AU040320 knockouts (dKO) revealed no evidence for impaired cortical lamination, neuronal migration, neurogenesis or other anatomical abnormalities. However, dKO mice displayed an auditory deficit in a behavioral gap-in-noise detection task. In addition, recordings of click-evoked auditory brainstem responses revealed suprathreshold deficits in wave III amplitude in AU040320-KO mice, and more general deficits in dKOs. These findings suggest that absence of AU040320 disrupts firing and/or synchrony of activity in the auditory brainstem, while loss of both proteins might affect both peripheral and central auditory function. Overall, these results stand against the proposed role of KIAA0319 and AU040320 in neuronal migration and outline their relationship with deficits in the auditory system.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Left-right asymmetry of the Maxwell spot centroids in adults without and with dyslexia.In human vision, the brain has to select one view of the world from our two eyes. However, the existence of a clear anatomical asymmetry providing an initial imbalance for normal neural development is still not understood. Using a so-called foveascope, we found that for a cohort of 30 normal adults, the two blue cone-free areas at the centre of the foveas are asymmetrical. The noise-stimulated afterimage dominant eye introduced here corresponds to the circular blue cone-free area, while the non-dominant eye corresponds to the diffuse and irregular elliptical outline. By contrast, we found that this asymmetry is absent or frustrated in a similar cohort of 30 adults with normal ocular status, but with dyslexia, i.e. with visual and phonological deficits. In this case, our results show that the two Maxwell centroid outlines are both circular but lead to an undetermined afterimage dominance with a coexistence of primary and mirror images. The interplay between the lack of asymmetry and the development in the neural maturation of the brain pathways suggests new implications in both fundamental and biomedical sciences.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Dyslexic Characteristics of Chinese-Speaking Semantic Variant of Primary Progressive Aphasia.Reading disorder is a recognized feature in primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Surface dyslexia, characterized by regularization errors, is typically seen in the English-speaking semantic variant of PPA (svPPA). However, dyslexic characteristics of other languages, particularly logographical languages such as Chinese, remain sparse in the literature. This study aims to characterize and describe the dyslexic pattern in this group of patients by comparing an English-speaking svPPA group with a Chinese-speaking svPPA group. The authors hypothesized that Chinese-speaking individuals with svPPA would likely commit fewer surface dyslexic errors. By accessing the database of Singapore's National Neuroscience Institute and the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center of the United States, the authors identified three Chinese-speaking and 18 English-speaking patients with svPPA, respectively, for comparison. The results suggest that, instead of surface dyslexia, svPPA in Chinese-speaking individuals is characterized by a profound deep dyslexic error. Based on current evidence suggesting the role of the temporal pole as a semantic convergence center, the authors conclude that this region also mediates and converges lexical-semantic significance in logographical languages.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The role of READ1 and KIAA0319 genetic variations in developmental dyslexia: testing main and interactive effects.Developmental dyslexia (DD) is a complex heritable condition characterized by impaired reading abilities. Two well-replicated candidate risk factors are as follows: (1) regulatory element associated with dyslexia 1 (READ1), which is located in intron 2 of DCDC2 and acts as a binding site for protein regulation of DCDC2 expression; and (2) a three-single-nucleotide polymorphism risk haplotype spanning KIAA0319. Phylogenetically similar READ1 variants showed synergistic effects with the KIAA0319 risk haplotype on reading-related phenotypes in a general population sample. Here we examine the association between different allele classes in READ1, the KIAA0319 risk haplotype and reading-related traits in a cohort of 368 Italian children with DD and their siblings (n=266) by testing both main and non-additive effects. We replicated the deleterious main effects upon both reading accuracy and speed exerted by the longer READ1 alleles. We further supported the interdependence through non-additive, possibly antagonistic, effects between READ1 and the KIAA0319 risk haplotype on reading accuracy. By suggesting the presence of common biological processes underlying reading (dis)ability, these findings represent initial support for a generalist effect of the non-additive interdependence between READ1 and the KIAA0319 risk haplotype. Moreover, our results confirm that using as much information as possible about genetic interdependence among dyslexia-candidate genes can help in clinically assessing the individual risk for DD.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Using neurostimulation to understand the impact of pre-morbid individual differences on post-lesion outcomes.Neuropsychological data have proven invaluable in advancing our understanding of higher cognition. The interpretation of such data is, however, complicated by the fact that post-lesion behavioral abnormalities could reflect pre-morbid individual differences in the cognitive domain of interest. Here we exploited the virtual lesion methodology offered by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to explore the impact of pre-morbid individual differences on post-lesion performance. We applied this approach to the domain of reading, a crucial ability in which there are known to be considerable individual differences in the normal population. As predicted by neuropsychological studies of surface dyslexia in semantic dementia and the connectionist triangle model of reading, previous empirical work has shown that healthy participants vary in their reliance on meaning for reading words with atypical correspondences between spelling and sound. We therefore selected participants who varied along this dimension and applied a virtual lesion to the left anterior temporal lobe. As expected, we observed a significant three-way interaction between \"pre-morbid\" reading status, stimulation, and word type, such that TMS increased the disadvantage for spelling-sound atypical words more for the individuals with stronger semantic reliance. This successful test-case study provides an approach to understanding the impact of pre-morbid individual variation on post-lesion outcomes that could be fruitfully applied to a variety of cognitive domains.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Association between fine motor skills and binocular visual function in children with reading difficulties.Performance of fine motor skills (FMS) assessed by a clinical test battery has been associated with reading achievement in school-age children. However, the nature of this association remains to be established. The aim of this study was to assess FMS in children with reading difficulties using two experimental tasks, and to determine if performance is associated with reduced binocular function. We hypothesized that in comparison to an age- and sex-matched control group, children identified with reading difficulties will perform worse only on a motor task that has been shown to rely on binocular input. To test this hypothesis, motor performance was assessed using two tasks: bead-threading and peg-board in 19 children who were reading below expected grade and age-level. Binocular vision assessment included tests for stereoacuity, fusional vergence, amplitude of accommodation, and accommodative facility. In comparison to the control group, children with reading difficulties performed significantly worse on the bead-threading task. In contrast, performance on the peg-board task was similar in both groups. Accommodative facility was the only measure of binocular function significantly associated with motor performance. Findings from our exploratory study suggest that normal binocular vision may provide an important sensory input for the optimal development of FMS and reading. Given the small sample size tested in the current study, further investigation to assess the contribution of binocular vision to the development and performance of FMS and reading is warranted.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Familial history of reading difficulty is associated with diffused bilateral brain activation during reading and greater association with visual attention abilities.Reading difficulty (RD; or dyslexia) is a heritable condition characterized by slow, inaccurate reading accompanied by executive dysfunction, specifically with respect to visual attention. The current study was designed to examine the effect of familial history of RD on the relationship between reading and visual attention abilities in children with RD using a functional MRI reading task. Seventy-one children with RD participated in the study. Based on parental reports of the existence of RD in one or both of each child's parents, children with RD were divided into two groups: (1) those with a familial history of RD and (2) those without a familial history of RD. Reading and visual attention measures were collected from all participants. Functional MRI data during word reading was acquired in 30 participants of the entire cohort. Children with or without a familial history of RD demonstrated below-average reading and visual attention scores, with greater interaction between these measures in the group with a familial history of RD. Greater bilateral and diffused activation during word reading also were found in this group. We suggest that a familial history of RD is related to greater association between lower reading abilities and visual attention abilities. Parental history of RD therefore may be an important preschool screener (before reading age) to prompt early intervention focused on executive functions and reading-related skills.\n",

      "ABSTRACT How many deficits in the same dyslexic brains? A behavioural and fMRI assessment of comorbidity in adult dyslexics.Dyslexia can have different manifestations: this has motivated different theories on its nature, on its underlying brain bases and enduring controversies on how to best treat it. The relative weight of the different manifestations has never been evaluated using both behavioural and fMRI measures, a challenge taken here to assess the major systems called into play in dyslexia by different theories. We found that adult well-compensated dyslexics were systematically impaired only in reading and in visuo-phonological tasks, while deficits for other systems (e.g., motor/cerebellar, visual magnocellular/motion perception) were only very occasional. In line with these findings, fMRI showed a reliable hypoactivation only for the task of reading, in the left occipito-temporal cortex (l-OTC). The l-OTC, normally a crossroad between the reading system and other systems, did not show the same level of intersection in dyslexics; yet, it was not totally silent because it responded, in segregated parts, during auditory phonological and visual motion perception tasks. This minimal behavioural and functional anatomical comorbidity demonstrates that a specific deficit of reading is the best description for developmental dyslexia, at least for adult well-compensated cases, with clear implications for rehabilitation strategies. The reduced intersection of multiple systems in the l-OTC suggests that dyslexics suffer from a coarser connectivity, leading to disconnection between the multiple domains that normally interact during reading.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Holistic word processing in dyslexia.People with dyslexia have difficulty learning to read and many lack fluent word recognition as adults. In a novel task that borrows elements of the 'word superiority' and 'word inversion' paradigms, we investigate whether holistic word recognition is impaired in dyslexia. In Experiment 1 students with dyslexia and controls judged the similarity of pairs of 6- and 7-letter words or pairs of words whose letters had been partially jumbled. The stimuli were presented in both upright and inverted form with orthographic regularity and orientation randomized from trial to trial. While both groups showed sensitivity to orthographic regularity, both word inversion and letter jumbling were more detrimental to skilled than dyslexic readers supporting the idea that the latter may read in a more analytic fashion. Experiment 2 employed the same task but using shorter, 4- and 5-letter words and a design where orthographic regularity and stimuli orientation was held constant within experimental blocks to encourage the use of either holistic or analytic processing. While there was no difference in reaction time between the dyslexic and control groups for inverted stimuli, the students with dyslexia were significantly slower than controls for upright stimuli. These findings suggest that holistic word recognition, which is largely based on the detection of orthographic regularity, is impaired in dyslexia.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Accident ahead? Difficulties of drivers with and without reading impairment recognising words and pictograms in variable message signs.A timely and accurate acquisition of the information provided by variable message signs (VMS) can be crucial while driving. In the current study, we assess the difficulties of adults with dyslexia acquiring the information shown in VMS and provide evidence to discuss the controversial use of pictograms as potential countermeasures. Twenty-two adults with dyslexia and 22 matched controls completed a simulated driving session. The legibility of 12 VMS was assessed, including six text messages (e.g. \"ACCIDENT\") and six single pictograms (e.g. the icon for \"accident ahead\"). On average, participants with dyslexia started reading text messages when they were closer to the VMS. In addition, while approaching text VMS, they dedicated more gazes and manifested worse control of speed. Regarding pictogram VMS, we observed no differences in response distance, accuracy, response duration, or number of gazes. To sum up, the evidence provided reveals that adults with dyslexia, despite potential compensation effects, may still find difficulties reading text messages in VMS (shorter legibility distances, longer reading times, and increased cognitive effort), whereas we found no such differences in the recognition of pictograms (only some difficulties keeping a steady speed). Research on inclusive measures to improve reading in low-skilled or dyslexic drivers must be encouraged.\n",

      "ABSTRACT False memory for orthographically versus semantically similar words in adolescents with dyslexia: a fuzzy-trace theory perspective.The presented research was conducted in order to investigate the connections between developmental dyslexia and the functioning of verbatim and gist memory traces-assumed in the fuzzy-trace theory. The participants were 71 high school students (33 with dyslexia and 38 without learning difficulties). The modified procedure and multinomial model of Stahl and Klauer (simplified conjoint recognition model) was used to collect and analyze data. Results showed statistically significant differences in four of the model parameters: (a) the probability of verbatim trace recollection upon presentation of orthographically similar stimulus was higher in the control than dyslexia group, (b) the probability of verbatim trace recollection upon presentation of semantically similar stimulus was higher in the control than dyslexia group, (c) the probability of gist trace retrieval upon presentation of semantically similar stimulus was higher in the dyslexia than control group, and (d) the probability of gist trace retrieval upon target stimulus presentation (in the semantic condition) was higher in the control than dyslexia group. The obtained results suggest differences of memory functioning in terms of verbatim and gist trace retrieval between people with and without dyslexia on specific, elementary cognitive processes postulated by the fuzzy-trace theory. These can indicate new approaches in the education of persons with developmental dyslexia, focused on specific impairments and the strengths of their memory functioning.\n",

Our task, inspired by Berko's Wug Test, had the aim of testing the subjects' ability to apply pluralization rules to nonwords in the morphologically complex context of Italian nominal inflection. Results demonstrate that dyslexics display poorer morphological skills in comparison to controls, showing lower accuracy in the task. Furthermore, the dissimilar performances reported by the subjects in the different conditions indicate that the ability to inflect nonwords depends on factors such as the rule's productivity, frequency, and opacity with respect to gender. Finally, the children's performance in this task was significantly related to their reading proficiency, and it could predict accuracy in word reading independently of phonological awareness and working memory.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Evaluating the impact of dyslexia laws on the identification of specific learning disability and dyslexia.Dyslexia is a specific learning disability that impacts word reading accuracy and/or reading fluency. Over half of the states in the USA have passed legislation intended to promote better identification of individuals with dyslexia. To date, no study has been conducted to investigate the potential impact of state laws on the identification of specific learning disability (SLD), and limited data has been presented on the rate at which students in public school settings are identified with dyslexia. The first aim of the current study was to determine if any detectable changes in the identification rates of SLD have occurred in states implementing dyslexia laws because most states do not report number of students identified as dyslexic but rather those students identified with an SLD. The second aim of the study was to characterize the rate of identifying dyslexia in the two states (Texas and Arkansas) that require public schools to report the number of students identified with dyslexia. The third aim was to characterize the identification rate across first to 12th grades. Current SLD rates range from 3.2 to 8.5% in all 50 states. Analysis of SLD prevalence rates did not vary between states with and without dyslexia laws in place. Moreover, there was no change in the identification of SLD once states had implemented these laws. Rates of dyslexia in Arkansas and Texas were less than 5%. Given the persistent levels indicating lack of reading proficiency, our review of data suggests that overall students with dyslexia are being underidentified.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The role of feedback in implicit and explicit artificial grammar learning: a comparison between dyslexic and non-dyslexic adults.The importance of feedback for learning has been firmly established over the past few decades. The question of whether feedback plays a significant role in the statistical learning abilities of adults with dyslexia, however, is currently unresolved. Here, we examined the role of feedback in grammaticality judgment, type of structural knowledge, and confidence rating in both typically developed and dyslexic adults. We implemented two artificial grammar learning experiments: implicit and explicit. The second experiment was directly analogous to the first experiment in all respects except training format: the standard memorization instruction was replaced with an explicit rule-search instruction. Each experiment was conducted with and without performance feedback. While both groups showed significantly improved learning in the feedback-based explicit artificial grammar learning task, only the typically developed adults demonstrated higher levels of conscious structural knowledge. The present study demonstrates that the basis for the grammaticality judgment of adults with dyslexia differs from that of typically developed adults, regardless of increase in the level of explicitness.\n",

The present cross-sectional study investigated phonological encoding skills in dyslexic Danish students. We compared dyslexic and non-dyslexic students from grades 3, 5, 7, and 9 and examined whether effects of item length were stronger in the dyslexic groups. Mixed between-within subjects analyses of variance revealed significant interactions between dyslexia status and item length as the dyslexics at all grade levels were more affected by item length than their non-dyslexic peers. A marked developmental delay was apparent as the dyslexic group from grade 9 performed on approximately the same level as the non-dyslexic group from grade 3. Although the overall difference between these two groups was not significant, a significant interaction between dyslexia status and item length remained because the grade 9 dyslexics were more affected by item length than the younger non-dyslexic students. This difference in error profiles suggests a difference in the developmental patterns of dyslexic vs. non-dyslexic students.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Language and social-emotional and behavioural wellbeing from 4 to 7 years: a community-based study.Language disorder (LD) and social-emotional and behavioural (SEB) difficulties are common childhood problems that often co-occur. While there is clear evidence of these associations from clinical samples, less is known about community samples. This paper examines these associations in children aged 4-7 years from a community-based longitudinal study. 771 families provided questionnaire and assessment data at 4, 5 and 7 years. Parent-reported SEB difficulties were measured at each point (SDQ). Child language was directly assessed at 4 (CELF-P2), 5 and 7 years (CELF-4). Linear regression analysis was used to compare cross-sectional differences in mean SDQ scores between children with and without LD at each time point. Linear regression was then used to examine how patterns of language development (language disordered at three time points; never disordered; disordered at one or two time points, i.e. 'unstable' group) related to SEB difficulties at each age, adjusted for potential confounders, as in the previous analyses. Higher hyperactivity/inattention scores were associated with LD at each age. In fully adjusted models, there was little difference in mean emotional symptoms scores between children with and without LD. The 'never' LD group had lower mean SDQ scores at each time point than the 'unstable' group. Findings highlight that children with persistent LD from preschool to early primary school may be more likely to have concomitant SEB difficulties, particularly behavioural difficulties. Those with unstable LD may also have co-occurring SEB difficulties, showing a need for education and health professionals to monitor early language and SEB development.\n",

Moreover, most of these studies used a combination of training tasks targeting a variety of WM components, making it difficult to determine whether WM training generates a general improvement in overall reading, or improves specific cognitive skills corresponding to the WM components that are targeted in training. We tested the general and specific effects of WM training on the reading skills of 45 Chinese children with DD, grades 3 to 5. In Experiment 1, the experimental group received a program targeting the verbal WM component; in Experiment 2, the experimental group was trained with a program targeting visuospatial WM. In both experiments the control group played a placebo video game. In Experiment 1, the experimental group outperformed the control group on the visual rhyming task, which is highly correlated with verbal WM. In Experiment 2, the experimental group outperformed the control group on the orthographic awareness test, which is highly correlated with visuospatial WM. Furthermore, in both Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, the experimental groups outperformed the control groups on the fast word naming test, which is highly related to both visuospatial WM and verbal WM. Results indicated that WM training improved specific reading-related cognitive skills that are highly correlated with the specific WM components that were the target of training.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Altered Structural Connectivity of the Left Visual Thalamus in Developmental Dyslexia.Developmental dyslexia is a highly prevalent reading disorder affecting about 5%-10% of children [1]. It is characterized by slow and/or inaccurate word recognition skills as well as by poor spelling and decoding abilities [2]. Partly due to technical challenges with investigating subcortical sensory structures, current research on dyslexia in humans by and large focuses on the cerebral cortex [3-7]. These studies found that dyslexia is typically associated with functional and structural alterations of a distributed left-hemispheric cerebral cortex network (e.g., [8, 9]). However, findings from animal models and post mortem studies in humans suggest that dyslexia might also be associated with structural alterations in subcortical sensory pathways [10-14] (reviewed in [7]). Whether these alterations also exist in dyslexia in vivo and how they relate to dyslexia symptoms is currently unknown. Here, we used ultra-high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion MRI, and probabilistic tractography to investigate the structural connections of the visual sensory pathway in dyslexia in vivo. We discovered that individuals with dyslexia have reduced structural connections in the direct pathway between the left visual thalamus (lateral geniculate nucleus [LGN]) and left middle temporal area V5/MT, but not between the left LGN and left primary visual cortex. In addition, left V5/MT-LGN connectivity strength correlated with rapid naming abilities-a key deficit in dyslexia [15]. These findings provide the first evidence of specific structural alterations in the connections between the sensory thalamus and cortex in developmental dyslexia. The results challenge current standard models and provide novel evidence for the importance of cortico-thalamic interactions in explaining dyslexia.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The impact of developmental dyslexia and dysgraphia on movement production during word writing.This study investigated how deficits in orthographic processing affect movement production during word writing. Children with dyslexia and dysgraphia wrote words and pseudo-words on a digitizer. The words were orthographically regular and irregular of varying frequency. The group analysis revealed that writing irregular words and pseudo-words increased movement duration and dysfluency. This indicates that the spelling processes were active while the children were writing the words. The impact of these spelling processes was stronger for the children with dyslexia and dysgraphia. The analysis of individual performance revealed that most dyslexic/dysgraphic children presented similar writing patterns. However, selective lexical processing deficits affected irregular word writing but not pseudo-word writing. Selective poor sublexical processing affected pseudo-word writing more than irregular word writing. This study suggests that the interaction between orthographic and motor processing constitutes an important cognitive load that may disrupt the graphic outcome of the children with dyslexia/dysgraphia.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Longitudinal interactions between brain and cognitive measures on reading development from 6 months to 14 years.Dyslexia is a neurobiological disorder impairing learning to read. Brain responses of infants at genetic risk for dyslexia are abnormal already at birth, and associations from infant speech perception to preschool cognitive skills and reading in early school years have been documented, but there are no studies showing predicting power until adolescence. Here we show that in at-risk infants, brain activation to pseudowords at left hemisphere predicts 44% of reading speed at 14 years, and even improves the prediction after taking into account neurocognitive preschool measures of letter naming, phonology, and verbal short-term memory. The association between infant brain responses and reading speed is mediated by preschool rapid automatized naming ability. Therefore, we suggest that rapid naming and reading speed could share a similar cognitive process of automatized access to lexicon via phonological representations, and brain activation to speech sounds in infancy probably acts as an index of deficient development of the same process.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Does the late positive component reflect successful reading acquisition? A longitudinal ERP study.Developmental dyslexia is a reading disorder that is associated with deficits in phonological processing, where the exact neural basis for those processing deficits remains unclear. In particular, disagreement exists whether degraded phonological representations or an impaired access to the phonological representations causes these deficits. To investigate this question and to trace changes in neurophysiology during the process of reading acquisition, we designed a longitudinal study with event related potentials (ERPs) in children between kindergarten and second grade. We used an explicit word processing task to elicit the late positive component (LPC), which has been shown to reflect phonological processing. A brain-wide analysis of the LPC with an electrode-wise application of mixed effects models showed significantly attenuated amplitudes in the left temporo-parietal region in dyslexic children. Since these differences were only present in the word and not in the picture (i.e. control) condition, the attenuated amplitudes might reflect impaired access to the phonological representations of words. This was further confirmed by the longitudinal development, which showed a rapid increase in amplitude at the beginning of reading instruction and a decrease with continuing automatization, possibly pointing to a progression from grapheme-phoneme parsing to whole word reading. Our longitudinal study provides the first evidence that it is possible to detect neurophysiological differences in the LPC between children with dyslexia and control children in both preliterate and very early stages of reading acquisition, providing new insights about the neurophysiological development and a potential marker of later reading problems.\n",

This research had two main goals. First, we aimed to develop a screening protocol for early identification of Brazilian children at risk for dyslexia; second, we aimed to identify the predictive variables of this protocol using Principal Component Analysis. The major step involved in developing this protocol was the selection of variables, which were chosen based on the literature review and linguistic criteria. The screening protocol was composed of seven cognitive-linguistic skills: Letter naming; Phonological Awareness (which comprises the following subtests: Rhyme production, Rhyme identification, Syllabic segmentation, Production of words from a given phoneme, Phonemic Synthesis, and Phonemic analysis); Phonological Working memory, Rapid naming Speed; Silent reading; Reading of words and non-words; and Auditory Comprehension of sentences from pictures. A total of 149 children, aged from 6 years to 6 and 11, of both genders who were enrolled in the 1st grade of elementary public schools were submitted to the screening protocol.

      "ABSTRACT Effects of Phonological Training on the Reading and Reading-Related Abilities of Hong Kong Children with Dyslexia.This study aimed to investigate phonological awareness training by examining outcomes among Chinese children who learn Chinese without phonetic system training. Fifty-six Hong Kong children from the 3rd to 6th grades were recruited. Two-thirds of the children had been officially identified as dyslexic by the local government, and the remainder were considered high risk for dyslexia. The children were divided equally into a control group and an experimental group, with the groups matched as closely as possible by age and gender. Children in the experimental group were trained by onset-rime-level phonological training. The training lasted ~3 weeks, with 15 daily sessions lasting ~20 min each. Our results indicated that children in the experimental group made significant improvements in Chinese character reading, onset awareness, rime awareness, and rapid naming after training. The association between phonological awareness and Chinese character reading, especially the association between rime awareness and Chinese character reading, also changed after training. The benefits of phonological awareness training were more obvious for children younger than 10 years old. The results of the present study can be extended to provide another approach to Chinese learning for children suffering from reading difficulties who are not responding to the usual approach in their region.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Morpheme-Based Reading and Writing in Spanish Children with Dyslexia.It has been well documented that morphemic structure (roots and affixes) have an impact in reading, but effects seem to depend on the reading experience of readers and lexical characteristics of the stimuli. Specifically, it has been reported that morphemes constitute reading units for developing readers and children with dyslexia when they encounter a new word. In addition, recent studies have stated that the effect of morphology is also present in spelling, as morphological information facilitates spelling accuracy and influences handwriting times. The goal of this study was to investigate the role of morphology in reading and spelling fluency in Spanish children with dyslexia. For that purpose, a group of 24 children with dyslexia was compared with an age-matched group of 24 children without reading disabilities in performing a word naming task and a spelling-to-dictation task of isolated words. Morphological condition (high frequency base, low frequency base, simple) and lexicality (words vs. pseudowords) were manipulated. We considered, for the naming task, reading latencies, reading durations, reading critical segment (three first phonemes) durations and naming accuracy; and, for the spelling task, written latencies, writing durations for the whole word, writing critical segment (three first letters) durations and spelling accuracy. Results showed that Spanish children (with and without dyslexia) benefit from a high frequency base to initiate reading and writing responses, showing that they are familiar with the letter chunks that constitute a morpheme. In addition, base frequency impacts reading critical segment duration only for children with dyslexia, but for both groups in writing. In summary, children with dyslexia benefit from a high frequency base to read and spell unfamiliar stimuli.\n",

Three questions were investigated. (1) Does the Dyslexie font lead to faster and/or more accurate reading? (2) Do children have a preference for the Dyslexie font? And, (3) is font preference related to reading performance? In Experiment 1, children with dyslexia (n = 170) did not read text written in Dyslexie font faster or more accurately than in Arial font. The majority preferred reading in Arial and preference was not related to reading performance. In Experiment 2, children with (n = 102) and without dyslexia (n = 45) read word lists in three different font types (Dyslexie, Arial, Times New Roman). Words written in Dyslexie font were not read faster or more accurately. Moreover, participants showed a preference for the fonts Arial and Times New Roman rather than Dyslexie, and again, preference was not related to reading performance. These experiments clearly justify the conclusion that the Dyslexie font neither benefits nor impedes the reading process of children with and without dyslexia.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Attentional asymmetry between visual hemifields is related to habitual direction of reading and its implications for debate on cause and effects of dyslexia.A major controversy regarding dyslexia is whether any of the many visual and phonological deficits found to be correlated with reading difficulty cause the impairment or result from the reduced amount of reading done by dyslexics. We studied this question by comparing a visual capacity in the left and right visual hemifields in people habitually reading scripts written right-to-left or left-to-right. Selective visual attention is necessary for efficient visual search and also for the sequential recognition of letters in words. Because such attentional allocation during reading depends on the direction in which one is reading, asymmetries in search efficiency may reflect biases arising from the habitual direction of reading. We studied this by examining search performance in three cohorts: (a) left-to-right readers who read English fluently; (b) right-to-left readers fluent in reading Farsi but not any left-to-right script; and (c) bilingual readers fluent in English and in Farsi, Arabic, or Hebrew. Left-to-right readers showed better search performance in the right hemifield and right-to-left readers in the left hemifield, but bilingual readers showed no such asymmetries. Thus, reading experience biases search performance in the direction of reading, which has implications for the cause and effect relationships between reading and cognitive functions.\n",

Two important work-related factors are self-efficacy and emotional experience with dyslexia. Work self-efficacy is viewed one of the most vital intrapersonal capacities in the work environment. It can be viewed as a subjective indicator of work success and is conceptualized as a multidimensional construct. Research speaks to a unique emotional experience stemming from living with an often misunderstood and stereotyped learning difference. The participants were 173 working adults with dyslexia (average age = 43.5 years, females = 56.6%) who participated in a web-based survey. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that more negative or uncomfortable emotions emanating from living with dyslexia predicted lower levels of total work self-efficacy, work attributes, work competency, and work anxiety over and beyond background contextual variables.

      "ABSTRACT Evaluation of visual motion perception ability in mice with knockout of the dyslexia candidate susceptibility gene Dcdc2.Developmental dyslexia is a heritable disability characterized by difficulties in learning to read and write. The neurobiological and genetic mechanisms underlying dyslexia remain poorly understood; however, several dyslexia candidate risk genes have been identified. One of these candidate risk genes-doublecortin domain containing 2 (DCDC2)-has been shown to play a role in neuronal migration and cilia function. At a behavioral level, variants of DCDC2 have been associated with impairments in phonological processing, working memory and reading speed. Additionally, a specific mutation in DCDC2 has been strongly linked to deficits in motion perception-a skill subserving reading abilities. To further explore the relationship between DCDC2 and dyslexia, a genetic knockout (KO) of the rodent homolog of DCDC2 (Dcdc2) was created. Initial studies showed that Dcdc2 KOs display deficits in auditory processing and working memory. The current study was designed to evaluate the association between DCDC2 and motion perception, as these skills have not yet been assessed in the Dcdc2 KO mouse model. We developed a novel motion perception task, utilizing touchscreen technology and operant conditioning. Dcdc2 KOs displayed deficits on the Pairwise Discrimination task specifically as motion was added to visual stimuli. Following behavioral assessment, brains were histologically prepared for neuroanatomical analysis of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). The cumulative distribution showed that Dcdc2 KOs exhibited more small neurons and fewer larger neurons in the LGN. Results compliment findings that DCDC2 genetic alteration results in anomalies in visual motion pathways in a subpopulation of dyslexic patients.\n",

Yet whether this atypical lateralization precedes reading acquisition and is related to a familial risk for dyslexia is not currently known. In this study, we address these questions in 2 separate cohorts of young children and adolescents with and without a familial risk for dyslexia. Planum temporale surface area was manually labeled bilaterally, on the T1-weighted MR brain images of 54 pre-readers (mean age: 6.2 years, SD: 3.2 months; 33 males) and 28 adolescents (mean age: 14.7 years, SD: 3.3 months; 11 males). Half of the pre-readers and adolescents had a familial risk for dyslexia. In both pre-readers and adolescents, group comparisons of left and right planum temporale surface area showed a significant interaction between hemisphere and family history of dyslexia, with participants who had no family risk for dyslexia showing greater leftward asymmetry of the planum temporale. This effect was confirmed when analyses were restricted to normal reading participants. Altered planum temporale asymmetry thus seems to be related to family history of dyslexia.\n",

The findings indicated that children with RD and/or ADHD symptom(s) exhibited diverse cognitive profiles, and the distinguishing factor contributed to different inhibitions. Additionally, Chinese-speaking children with the co-morbid symptoms of RD and ADHD demonstrated greater deficits in auditory working memory and rapid naming than did the pure-deficit groups. Furthermore, although problems with phonological awareness were similar between the 2 groups, the deficiency of orthographic knowledge was more severe in children with RD than in the co-morbid group.

      "ABSTRACT The visual attention span deficit in Chinese children with reading fluency difficulty.With reading development, some children fail to learn to read fluently. However, reading fluency difficulty (RFD) has not been fully investigated. The present study explored the underlying mechanism of RFD from the aspect of visual attention span. Fourteen Chinese children with RFD and fourteen age-matched normal readers participated. The visual 1-back task was adopted to examine visual attention span. Reaction time and accuracy were recorded, and relevant d-prime (d') scores were computed. Results showed that children with RFD exhibited lower accuracy and lower d' values than the controls did in the visual 1-back task, revealing a visual attention span deficit. Further analyses on d' values revealed that the attention distribution seemed to exhibit an inverted U-shaped pattern without lateralization for normal readers, but a W-shaped pattern with a rightward bias for children with RFD, which was discussed based on between-group variation in reading strategies. Results of the correlation analyses showed that visual attention span was associated with reading fluency at the sentence level for normal readers, but was related to reading fluency at the single-character level for children with RFD. The different patterns in correlations between groups revealed that visual attention span might be affected by the variation in reading strategies. The current findings extend previous data from alphabetic languages to Chinese, a logographic language with a particularly deep orthography, and have implications for reading-dysfluency remediation.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Neurobiological Bases of Reading Disorder Part II: The Importance of Developmental Considerations in Typical and Atypical Reading.Decoding-based reading disorder (RD; aka developmental dyslexia) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders, affecting approximately 5-10% of school-aged children across languages. Even though neuroimaging studies suggest an impairment of the left reading network in RD, the onset of this deficit and its developmental course, which may include constancy and change, is largely unknown. There is now growing evidence that the recruitment of brain networks underlying perceptual, cognitive and linguistic processes relevant to reading acquisition varies with age. These age-dependent changes may in turn impact the neurocognitive characteristics of RD observed at specific developmental stages. Here we synthesize findings from functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies to increase our understanding of the developmental time course of the neural bases underlying (a)typical reading. We first provide an overview of the brain bases of typical and atypical (impaired) reading. Next we describe how the understanding of RD can be deepened through scientific attention to age effects, for example, by integrating findings from cross-sectional studies of RD at various ages. Finally, we accent findings from extant longitudinal studies that directly examine developmental reading trajectories beginning in the preliterate stage at both group and individual levels. Although science is at the very early stage of understanding developmental aspects of neural deficits in RD, evidence to date characterizes RD by atypical brain maturation. We know that reading impairment may adversely impact multiple life domains such as academic achievement and social relationships, and unfortunately, that these negative outcomes can persist and compound into adulthood. We contend that exploring the developmental trajectories of RD will contribute to a greater understanding of how neural systems support reading acquisition. Further, we propose and cite evidence that the etiology of RD can be better investigated by distinguishing primary deficits from secondary impairments unfolding along development. These exciting and modern investigatory efforts can also indirectly contribute to a centered practice of early and accurate identification and optimal intervention to support the development of foundational pre-literacy skills and fluent reading. In sum, integrating a developmental understanding into the science and practice of reading acquisition and intervention is both possible and necessary.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Dyslexia as a multi-deficit disorder: Working memory and auditory temporal processing.Dyslexia is difficulty in acquiring reading skills despite adequate intelligence and sufficient reading opportunities. Its origin is still under debate. Studies usually focus on a singular cause for dyslexia; however, some researchers argue that dyslexia reflects multiple deficits. Two of the abilities under investigation in dyslexia are working memory (WM) and auditory temporal processing (ATP). In order to better evaluate the relative roles of WM and ATP in dyslexia, in the present study, we tested the contribution of WM and ATP to different types of reading performance and phonological awareness in dyslexia, using a multidimensional approach. Seventy-eight adults with dyslexia and 23 normal-reading adults performed WM and ATP tasks, as well as reading and phonological awareness tests. Readers with dyslexia showed poorer performance on all tests. Both WM and ATP were significant predictors of reading performance and phonological awareness among participants with dyslexia. Dividing participants with dyslexia according to their performance level on WM and ATP tasks revealed group differences in reading and phonological awareness tests. Both WM and ATP contribute to dyslexia, and varying levels of difficulties in both of these abilities are observed among this population. This is strong evidence in favor of the multi-deficit approach in dyslexia, and suggests that researchers should consider this approach in future studies of dyslexia.\n",

A wide-ranging match was achieved between the dyslexic group and the younger reading-matched comparison group, enabling longitudinal comparisons on essentially identical initial performance profiles. Group differences were found in the development of tasks relying on phonological processing skill, such as phoneme deletion in pseudowords, pseudoword reading accuracy and time, as well as in graphemic spelling accuracy. The results confirm findings from cross-sectional studies of reading difficulty in the relatively transparent Greek orthography and are consistent with a phonological processing deficit underlying and reciprocally interacting with underdevelopment of reading and spelling skills in the impaired population.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Neither action nor phonological video games make dyslexic children read better.The prevalence and long-term consequences of dyslexia make it crucial to look for effective and efficient ways of its therapy. Action video games (AVG) were implied as a possible remedy for difficulties in reading in Italian and English-speaking children. However, the studies examining the effectiveness of AVG application in dyslexia suffered from significant methodological weaknesses such as small sample sizes and lack of a control group with no intervention. In our study, we tested how two forms of training: based on AVG and on phonological non-action video games (PNAVG), affect reading in a group of fifty-four Polish children with dyslexia. Both speed and accuracy of reading increased in AVG as much as in PNAVG group. Moreover, both groups improved in phonological awareness, selective attention and rapid naming. Critically, the reading progress in the two groups did not differ from a dyslexic control group which did not participate in any training. Thus, the observed improvement in reading in AVG and PNAVG can be attributed either to the normal reading development related to schooling or to test practice effect. Overall, we failed to replicate previous studies: Neither AVG nor PNAVG remedy difficulties in reading in school children.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Pathways Into Literacy: The Role of Early Oral Language Abilities and Family Risk for Dyslexia.The present study investigated the role of early oral language and family risk for dyslexia in the two developmental pathways toward reading comprehension, through word reading and through oral language abilities. The sample contained 237 children (164 at family risk for dyslexia) from the Dutch Dyslexia Program. Longitudinal data were obtained on seven occasions when children were between 4 and 12 years old. The relationship between early oral language ability and reading comprehension at the age of 12 years was mediated by preliteracy skills and word-decoding ability for the first pathway and by later language abilities for the second pathway. Family risk influenced literacy development through its subsequent relations with preliteracy skills, word decoding, and reading comprehension. Although performance on language measures was often lower for the family-risk group than for the no-family-risk group, family risk did not have a specific relation with either early or later oral language abilities.\n",

Geschwind and Galaburda (1985) suggested that processing difficulties in dyslexia are due to structural differences between hemispheres. Because of its potential significance to the controversial magnocellular theory of dyslexia, we investigated hemispheric differences in the human lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), the primary visual relay and control nucleus in the thalamus, in subjects with dyslexia compared to normal readers. We acquired and averaged multiple high-resolution proton density (PD) weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumes to measure in detail the anatomical boundaries of the LGN in each hemisphere. We observed hemispheric asymmetries in the orientation of the nucleus in subjects with dyslexia that were absent in controls. We also found differences in the location of the LGN between hemispheres in controls but not in subjects with dyslexia. Neither the precise anatomical differences in the LGN nor their functional consequences are known, nor is it clear whether the differences might be causes or effects of dyslexia.\n",

      "ABSTRACT What is Developmental Dyslexia?Until the 1950s, developmental dyslexia was defined as a hereditary visual disability, selectively affecting reading without compromising oral or non-verbal reasoning skills. This changed radically after the development of the phonological theory of dyslexia; this not only ruled out any role for visual processing in its aetiology, but it also cast doubt on the use of discrepancy between reading and reasoning skills as a criterion for diagnosing it. Here I argue that this theory is set at too high a cognitive level to be explanatory; we need to understand the pathophysiological visual and auditory mechanisms that cause children's phonological problems. I discuss how the 'magnocellular theory' attempts to do this in terms of slowed and error prone temporal processing which leads to dyslexics' defective visual and auditory sequencing when attempting to read. I attempt to deal with the criticisms of this theory and show how it leads to a number of successful ways of helping dyslexic children to overcome their reading difficulties.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Ancestral Variations of the PCDHG Gene Cluster Predispose to Dyslexia in a Multiplex Family.Dyslexia is a heritable neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties in reading and writing. In this study, we describe the identification of a set of 17 polymorphisms located across 1.9Mb region on chromosome 5q31.3, encompassing genes of the PCDHG cluster, TAF7, PCDH1 and ARHGAP26, dominantly inherited with dyslexia in a multi-incident family. Strikingly, the non-risk form of seven variations of the PCDHG cluster, are preponderant in the human lineage, while risk alleles are ancestral and conserved across Neanderthals to non-human primates. Four of these seven ancestral variations (c.460A>C [p.Ile154Leu], c.541G>A [p.Ala181Thr], c.2036G>C [p.Arg679Pro] and c.2059A>G [p.Lys687Glu]) result in amino acid alterations. p.Ile154Leu and p.Ala181Thr are present at EC2: EC3 interacting interface of γA3-PCDH and γA4-PCDH respectively might affect trans-homophilic interaction and hence neuronal connectivity. p.Arg679Pro and p.Lys687Glu are present within the linker region connecting trans-membrane to extracellular domain. Sequence analysis indicated the importance of p.Ile154, p.Arg679 and p.Lys687 in maintaining class specificity. Thus the observed association of PCDHG genes encoding neural adhesion proteins reinforces the hypothesis of aberrant neuronal connectivity in the pathophysiology of dyslexia. Additionally, the striking conservation of the identified variants indicates a role of PCDHG in the evolution of highly specialized cognitive skills critical to reading.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Development of a language screening instrument for Swedish 4-year-olds.The Swedish Program for health surveillance of preschool children includes screening of language and communication abilities. One important language screening is carried out at age 4 years as part of a general screening conducted by health nurses at child health centres. The instruments presently in use for this screening mainly focus on expressive phonology. This may result in both over-referral of children with phonological difficulties and under-referral of children with language disorders (LDs), involving difficulties with vocabulary, grammar and/or language comprehension. Previous research has proposed non-word repetition as a clinical marker for LD. It has also been found that higher predictive power is achieved when non-word repetition is combined with the assessment of lexical/semantic skills. Taking these findings into account, the construction of a language screening instrument may yield more adequate referrals to speech-language therapists (SLTs).\n",

      "ABSTRACT Auditory temporal perceptual learning and transfer in Chinese-speaking children with developmental dyslexia.Perceptual learning refers to the improvement of perceptual performance as a function of training. Recent studies found that auditory perceptual learning may improve phonological skills in individuals with developmental dyslexia in alphabetic writing system. However, whether auditory perceptual learning could also benefit the reading skills of those learning the Chinese logographic writing system is, as yet, unknown. The current study aimed to investigate the remediation effect of auditory temporal perceptual learning on Mandarin-speaking school children with developmental dyslexia. Thirty children with dyslexia were screened from a large pool of students in 3th-5th grades. They completed a series of pretests and then were assigned to either a non-training control group or a training group. The training group worked on a pure tone duration discrimination task for 7 sessions over 2 weeks with thirty minutes per session. Post-tests immediately after training and a follow-up test 2 months later were conducted. Analyses revealed a significant training effect in the training group relative to non-training group, as well as near transfer to the temporal interval discrimination task and far transfer to phonological awareness, character recognition and reading fluency. Importantly, the training effect and all the transfer effects were stable at the 2-month follow-up session. Further analyses found that a significant correlation between character recognition performance and learning rate mainly existed in the slow learning phase, the consolidation stage of perceptual learning, and this effect was modulated by an individuals' executive function. These findings indicate that adaptive auditory temporal perceptual learning can lead to learning and transfer effects on reading performance, and shed further light on the potential role of basic perceptual learning in the remediation and prevention of developmental dyslexia.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Paired associate learning deficits in poor readers: The contribution of phonological input and output processes.It is well-established that poor readers exhibit deficits in paired associate learning (PAL), and there is increasing evidence for a phonological locus of these deficits. However, it remains unclear whether poor performance stems from difficulties specific to the phonological output system or difficulties that affect both phonological input and output processes. Understanding these deficits is important not only in the context of PAL but also for informing broader theories of typical and atypical reading development. We developed a novel paradigm that allowed us to assess PAL in the presence and absence of phonological output demands. In total, 14 poor readers and 14 age-matched controls were first trained to criterion in verbal-visual PAL before being tested in the visual-verbal direction. The results showed that poor readers learned at the same rate as controls in verbal-visual PAL, even when the nonword stimuli were phonologically confusable. Yet, despite having reached the same criterion as controls in verbal-visual PAL, poor readers exhibited robust impairments for those same paired associates in visual-verbal PAL. The overall pattern of results is most consistent with the conclusion that PAL deficits reflect impairments to the phonological output system; however, results that may challenge this interpretation are also discussed.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Sluggish dorsally-driven inhibition of return during orthographic processing in adults with dyslexia.Dyslexia (D) is a neurodevelopmental reading disorder characterized by phonological and orthographic deficits. Before phonological decoding, reading requires a specialized orthographic system for parallel letter processing that assigns letter identities to different spatial locations. The magnocellular-dorsal (MD) stream rapidly process the spatial location of visual stimuli controlling visuo-spatial attention. To investigate the visuo-spatial attention efficiency during orthographic processing, inhibition of return (IOR) was measured in adults with and without D in a lexical decision task. IOR is the delay in responding to stimuli displayed in a cued location after a long cue-target interval. Only adults with D did not showed IOR effect during letter-string recognition, despite the typical left-hemisphere specialization for word identification. A specific deficit in coherent-dot-motion perception confirmed an MD-stream disorder in adults with D. Our results suggest that adults with D might develop an efficient visual word form area, but a dorsal-attentional dysfunction impairs their reading fluency.\n",

      "ABSTRACT No evidence for systematic white matter correlates of dyslexia: An Activation Likelihood Estimation meta-analysis.Dyslexia is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by reading and spelling difficulties. Beyond the behavioral and functional correlates of this condition, a growing number of studies have explored structural differences between individuals with dyslexia and typically developing individuals. To date, findings remain disparate - some studies suggest differences in fractional anisotropy (FA), an indirect measure of white matter integrity, whereas others do not identify significant disparities. Here, we synthesized the existing literature on this topic by conducting a meta-analysis of Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) studies investigating white matter correlates of dyslexia via voxel-based analyses (VBA) of FA. Our results showed no reliable clusters underlying differences between dyslexics and typical individuals, after correcting for multiple comparisons (false discovery rate correction). Because group comparisons might be too coarse to yield subtle differences, we further explored differences in FA as a function of reading ability, measured on a continuous scale. Consistent with our initial findings, reading ability was not associated with reliable differences in white matter integrity. These findings nuance the current view of profound, structural differences underlying reading ability and its associated disorders, and suggest that their neural correlates might be more subtle than previously thought.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Prefrontal mediation of the reading network predicts intervention response in dyslexia.A primary challenge facing the development of interventions for dyslexia is identifying effective predictors of intervention response. While behavioral literature has identified core cognitive characteristics of response, the distinction of reading versus executive cognitive contributions to response profiles remains unclear, due in part to the difficulty of segregating these constructs using behavioral outputs. In the current study we used functional neuroimaging to piece apart the mechanisms of how/whether executive and reading network relationships are predictive of intervention response. We found that readers who are responsive to intervention have more typical pre-intervention functional interactions between executive and reading systems compared to nonresponsive readers. These findings suggest that intervention response in dyslexia is influenced not only by domain-specific reading regions, but also by contributions from intervening domain-general networks. Our results make a significant gain in identifying predictive bio-markers of outcomes in dyslexia, and have important implications for the development of personalized clinical interventions.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Aberrant resting-state functional brain networks in dyslexia: Symbolic mutual information analysis of neuromagnetic signals.Neuroimaging studies have identified a variety of structural and functional connectivity abnormalities in students experiencing reading difficulties. The present study adopted a novel approach to assess the dynamics of resting-state neuromagnetic recordings in the form of symbolic sequences (i.e., repeated patterns of neuromagnetic fluctuations within and/or between sensors). Participants were 25 students experiencing severe reading difficulties (RD) and 27 age-matched non-impaired readers (NI) aged 7-14 years. Sensor-level data were first represented as symbolic sequences in eight conventional frequency bands. Next, dominant types of sensor-to-sensor interactions in the form of intra and cross-frequency coupling were computed and subjected to graph modeling to assess group differences in global network characteristics. As a group RD students displayed predominantly within-frequency interactions between neighboring sensors which may reflect reduced overall global network efficiency and cost-efficiency of information transfer. In contrast, sensor networks among NI students featured a higher proportion of cross-frequency interactions. Brain-reading achievement associations highlighted the role of left hemisphere temporo-parietal functional networks, at rest, for reading acquisition and ability.\n",

Structural neuroimaging studies have indicated that these disorders can be related to differences in white matter integrity, although findings remain disparate. In this study, we used a unique design composed of individuals with dyslexia, dyscalculia, both disorders and controls, to systematically explore differences in fractional anisotropy across groups using diffusion tensor imaging. Specifically, we focused on the corona radiata and the arcuate fasciculus, two tracts associated with reading and mathematics in a number of previous studies. Using Bayesian hypothesis testing, we show that the present data favor the null model of no differences between groups for these particular tracts-a finding that seems to go against the current view but might be representative of the disparities within this field of research. Together, these findings suggest that structural differences associated with dyslexia and dyscalculia might not be as reliable as previously thought, with potential ramifications in terms of remediation.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Shorter cortical adaptation in dyslexia is broadly distributed in the superior temporal lobe and includes the primary auditory cortex.Studies of the performance of individuals with dyslexia in perceptual tasks suggest that their implicit inference of sound statistics is impaired. Previously, using two-tone frequency discrimination, we found that the effect of previous trials' frequencies on the judgments of individuals with dyslexia decays faster than the effect on controls' judgments, and that the adaptation (decrease of neural response to repeated stimuli) of their ERP responses to tones is shorter (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib22\">Jaffe-Dax et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we show the cortical distribution of these abnormal dynamics of adaptation using fast-acquisition fMRI. We find that faster decay of adaptation in dyslexia is widespread, although the most significant effects are found in the left superior temporal lobe, including the auditory cortex. This broad distribution suggests that the faster decay of implicit memory of individuals with dyslexia is a general characteristic of their cortical dynamics, which also affects sensory cortices.\n",

Performance on such tasks is strongly associated with reading ability, and there is increasing evidence that verbal task demands may be critical in explaining this relationship. The current study investigated the relationships between different forms of PAL and reading ability. A total of 97 children aged 8-10 years completed a battery of reading assessments and six different PAL tasks (phoneme-phoneme, visual-phoneme, nonverbal-nonverbal, visual-nonverbal, nonword-nonword, and visual-nonword) involving both familiar phonemes and unfamiliar nonwords. A latent variable path model showed that PAL ability is captured by two correlated latent variables: auditory-articulatory and visual-articulatory. The auditory-articulatory latent variable was the stronger predictor of reading ability, providing support for a verbal account of the PAL-reading relationship.\n",

Traditionally on reading readiness research there is a great interest to find out what factors affect early reading ability, but differ from other academic skills that affect general school learnings. Furthermore, it is also known how the influence of pre-reading variables in two countries with the same language, affect the development of the reading. On the other hand, several studies have examined what skills are related to reading readiness (phonological awareness, alphabetic awareness, naming speed, linguistic skills, metalinguistic knowledge and basic cognitive processes), but there are no studies showing whether countries can also influence the development of these skills.Our main objective in this study was to establish whether there were differences in the degree of acquisition of these skills between Spanish (119 children) and Peruvian (128 children), five years old children assessed in their own countries and after controlling Economic, Social and Cultural Status (ESCS). The results show that there are significant differences in the degree of acquisition of these skills between these two samples. It's especially relevant, in these results, that the main predictor in a regression study was the country of origin, explaining a higher percentage of variance than other variables such as age differences, in months, or gender. These findings corroborate the results obtained in other studies with migrant population.\n",

Thirty university students with dyslexia and 32 chronological-age controls were assessed on RAN Digits and Colors as well as on two versions of RAN Letters and Objects (one with five items repeated 16 times and one with 20 items repeated four times). In addition, participants were tested on discrete letter and object naming, phonological awareness, orthographic knowledge, and speed of processing, and the RAN Letters and Objects total times were partitioned into pause times and articulation times. Results showed first that the dyslexia group was slower than the control group on all RAN tasks and the differences remained significant after controlling for discrete naming time. Second, both groups were slower in the large item set condition (20 × 4) than in the small set condition (5 × 16). Third, the dyslexia group was slower than the control group in both the pause and the articulation times. Although none of the processing skills was sufficient on its own to eliminate group differences in RAN Letters components, phonological awareness, and orthographic processing were sufficient on their own to eliminate group differences in the RAN Objects pause time. Taken together, our findings suggest that the deficits in RAN are not due to impaired anchoring, but rather due to subtle impairments in lexical access (specific to alphanumeric RAN), serial processing, and articulation.\n",

Word frequency and word length were manipulated as within-subject factors. We analyzed (a) reading accuracy, (b) how far the sign was when the participant started to give the response, (c) where the participant looked during the time leading up to the response, and (d) the variability of the vehicle's speed during that time and during driving on similar segments of the route that did not present the traffic signs. Individuals with dyslexia showed lower levels of performance in the reading task, the roles of word frequency and word length were more influential for them, and there was larger variability of the vehicle's speed during the time they were attempting to read the traffic sign, which did not occur during their driving on similar segments that did not present the targeted traffic signs. Therefore, the specific needs of individuals with dyslexia on the road should be considered in plans aimed at increasing traffic safety and fluidity.\n",

In two experiments we assessed such high-level visual deficits in people with a history of reading problems. Experiment 1 showed that people who were worse at face matching had greater reading problems. In experiment 2, matched dyslexic and typical readers were tested, and difficulties with face matching were consistently found to predict dyslexia over and above both novel-object matching as well as matching noise patterns that shared low-level visual properties with faces. Furthermore, ADHD measures could not account for face matching problems.

However, its long-term effects have not been determined. This study confirmed the ameliorative effects of multiple sessions of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with a training for reading on the reading abilities of children and adolescents with dyslexia and examined whether they are long-lasting. Twenty-six children and adolescents with dyslexia received 3 20-min sessions per week for 6 weeks (18 sessions) of left anodal/right cathodal tDCS, set to 1 mA, over the parieto-temporal regions, combined with training for reading. The participants were randomly assigned to receive active or sham treatment. Reading measures (text, high- and low-frequency words, non-words) were recorded before and immediately after the treatment and 1 and 6 months later. The long-term tolerability to tDCS was also evaluated. The active group received long-lasting benefits in reading. Specifically, the non-word reading efficiency index improved at every time point, as did the low-frequency word reading efficiency index at 1 and 6 months after the end of the treatment. No differences emerged in the sham group. No long-term adverse effects were documented. This study provides evidence of persistent improvements in reading in children and adolescents with dyslexia, constituting a new rehabilitative approach for the remediation of dyslexia.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Investigating the benefit of adding listening passage preview to repeated readings.Repeated readings (RR) and listening passage preview (LPP) are commonly used reading fluency interventions. However, relatively little is known about the behavioral changes that occur in children's reading in response to these interventions and what reading behavior, if any, students engage in during LPP. As such, in the current study, 57 third-grade students were randomly assigned to either a RR or LPP + RR condition. Intervention effects were evaluated by measuring students' oral reading fluency and eye-movement (EM) behaviors. Results revealed similar outcomes across measures. Students in both conditions significantly increased their words read correctly per minute and decreased the number of errors made in reading, total fixation time, frequency of fixations, and percentage of words fixated. EM measures indicated students' reading improved particularly on low-frequency words because of a reduction in time spent on high-level text processing. Results have implications for the classroom as well as future EM research. (PsycINFO Database Record\n",

      "ABSTRACT Voxel-based lesion analysis of brain regions underlying reading and writing.The neural basis of reading and writing has been a source of inquiry as well as controversy in the neuroscience literature. Reading has been associated with both left posterior ventral temporal zones (termed the \"visual word form area\") as well as more dorsal zones, primarily in left parietal cortex. Writing has also been associated with left parietal cortex, as well as left sensorimotor cortex and prefrontal regions. Typically, the neural basis of reading and writing are examined in separate studies and/or rely on single case studies exhibiting specific deficits. Functional neuroimaging studies of reading and writing typically identify a large number of activated regions but do not necessarily identify the core, critical hubs. Last, due to constraints on the functional imaging environment, many previous studies have been limited to measuring the brain activity associated with single-word reading and writing, rather than sentence-level processing. In the current study, the brain correlates of reading and writing at both the single- and sentence-level were studied in a large sample of 111 individuals with a history of chronic stroke using voxel-based lesion symptom mapping (VLSM). VLSM provides a whole-brain, voxel-by-voxel statistical analysis of the role of distinct regions in a particular behavior by comparing performance of individuals with and without a lesion at every voxel. Rather than comparing individual cases or small groups with particular behavioral dissociations in reading and writing, VLSM allowed us to analyze data from a large, well-characterized sample of stroke patients exhibiting a wide range of reading and writing impairments. The VLSM analyses revealed that reading was associated with a critical left inferior temporo-occipital focus, while writing was primarily associated with the left supramarginal gyrus. Separate VLSM analyses of single-word versus sentence-level reading showed that sentence-level reading was uniquely associated with anterior to mid-portions of the middle and superior temporal gyri. Both single-word and sentence-level writing overlapped to a great extent in the left supramarginal gyrus, but sentence-level writing was associated with additional underlying white matter pathways such as the internal capsule. These findings suggest that critical aspects of reading and writing processes diverge, with reading relying critically on the ventral visual recognition stream and writing relying on a dorsal visuo-spatial-motor stream.\n",

We compared study time and knowledge gain in 26 11-year-old children with dyslexia and 38 typically reading peers in a within-subjects design. All children were presented with a series of user-paced multimedia lessons in 3 conditions: pictorial information presented with (a) written text, (b) audio, or (c) combined text and audio. We also examined whether children's learning outcomes were related to their working memory. With respect to study time, we found modality and reversed redundancy effects. Children with dyslexia spent more time learning in the text condition, compared with the audio condition and the combined text-and-audio condition. Regarding knowledge gain, no modality or redundancy effects were evidenced. Although the groups differed on working memory, it did not influence the modality or redundancy effect on study time or knowledge gain. In multimedia learning, it thus is more efficient to provide children with dyslexia with audio or with auditory support.\n",

To test whether the relation between phonological awareness and word reading efficiency differed for children with dyslexia versus typically developing children, we assessed phonological awareness and word reading efficiency in 50 children with dyslexia (aged 9;10, 35 boys) and 613 typically developing children (aged 9;5, 279 boys). Phonological awareness was found to be associated with word reading efficiency, similar for children with dyslexia and typically developing children. To find out whether the relation between working memory and word reading efficiency in the group with dyslexia could be explained by phonological awareness, the children with dyslexia were also tested on working memory. Results of a mediation analysis showed a significant indirect effect of working memory on word reading efficiency via phonological awareness. Working memory predicted reading efficiency, via its relation with phonological awareness in children with dyslexia. This indicates that working memory is necessary for word reading efficiency via its impact on phonological awareness and that phonological awareness continues to be important for word reading efficiency in older children with dyslexia.\n",

Perspectives of dyslexia assessors working with students in the UK higher education sector.Research findings and positions concerning the nature of the dyslexia construct are currently diverse and increasingly complex. The ability of assessor practitioners to operationalize such knowledge and categorically diagnose dyslexia in any reliable and consistent way is being questioned. This study aimed to explore the way in which diverse and complex research findings are operationalized in the dyslexia diagnostic assessment of UK higher education students. The perspectives of 118 professional assessors of dyslexia working within the sector were collected using a questionnaire and some interviews. Data were analysed both quantitatively and qualitatively, as appropriate, and then integrated. The results confirmed critics' concerns about the consistency and reliability of the construct as currently diagnosed within the higher education context. Key controversial aspects of practice that emerged included the contextualized interpretation of literacy difficulties, a general commitment to discrepancy concepts, scepticism about the face validity of prescribed psychometric tests, and a related reliance on professional observation and experience above test results. The findings pointed to the need for a more informed nuanced understanding of the dyslexia label and a more cautious and responsible attitude towards its use.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Enhanced Sensitivity to Subphonemic Segments in Dyslexia: A New Instance of Allophonic Perception.Although dyslexia can be individuated in many different ways, it has only three discernable sources: a visual deficit that affects the perception of letters, a phonological deficit that affects the perception of speech sounds, and an audio-visual deficit that disturbs the association of letters with speech sounds. However, the very nature of each of these core deficits remains debatable. The phonological deficit in dyslexia, which is generally attributed to a deficit of phonological awareness, might result from a specific mode of speech perception characterized by the use of allophonic (i.e., subphonemic) units. Here we will summarize the available evidence and present new data in support of the \"allophonic theory\" of dyslexia. Previous studies have shown that the dyslexia deficit in the categorical perception of phonemic features (e.g., the voicing contrast between /t/ and /d/) is due to the enhanced sensitivity to allophonic features (e.g., the difference between two variants of /d/). Another consequence of allophonic perception is that it should also give rise to an enhanced sensitivity to allophonic segments, such as those that take place within a consonant cluster. This latter prediction is validated by the data presented in this paper.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The current status of the magnocellular theory of developmental dyslexia.Some people doubt that the concept of developmental dyslexia (DD) is useful at all because the phonological weaknesses seen in DD cannot be distinguished from those found in every person with poor reading skills, whatever their cause. Here I argue that true DD is characterised by poor temporal processing, hence impaired visual and auditory sequencing, that is caused by impaired development of transient/magnocellular (M-) systems throughout the brain. These deficits can be measured in order to distinguish the causes of the phonological weaknesses in DD from those causing similar deficits in other types of poor reading. Importantly this knowledge can be exploited to develop effective improvements in treatment. The evidence for impaired visual magnocellular function in many, if not all, people with dyslexia is now overwhelming; it is supported not only by psychophysical tests of M- function, but also by electrophysiological, eye movement, attentional, imaging, interventional and genetic findings. Analogously, auditory temporal processing is mediated by auditory transient, 'magnocellular', processing systems, and evidence is accumulating persuasively that this system is also impaired in dyslexics. I briefly introduce the idea that 'motor magnocellular systems' may also be impaired in dyslexia, then consider genetic, immunological and nutritional factors that interact to cause the impaired magnocellular phenotype. I then discuss why the dyslexic phenotype is so common by speculating about what strengths it might confer that would maintain the responsible genes in the human genome.\n",

Twenty children with developmental dyslexia participated in the study and were matched with two control groups-one matched for age and other for reading skills. During 3 days, all participants performed an acquisition task, where they were exposed to colored geometrical forms sequences with an underlying grammatical structure. On the last day, after the acquisition task, participants were tested in a grammaticality classification task. Implicit sequence learning was present in dyslexic children, as well as in both control groups, and no differences between groups were observed. These results suggest that implicit learning deficits per se cannot explain the characteristic reading difficulties of the dyslexics.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Is Dyslexia a Brain Disorder?Specific word reading difficulty, commonly termed &lsquo;developmental dyslexia&rsquo;, refers to the low end of the word reading skill distribution but is frequently considered to be a neurodevelopmental disorder. This term implies that brain development is thought to be disrupted, resulting in an abnormal and dysfunctional brain. We take issue with this view, pointing out that there is no evidence of any obvious neurological abnormality in the vast majority of cases of word reading difficulty cases. The available relevant evidence from neuroimaging studies consists almost entirely of correlational and group-differences studies. However, differences in brains are certain to exist whenever differences in behavior exist, including differences in ability and performance. Therefore, findings of brain differences do not constitute evidence for abnormality; rather, they simply document the neural substrate of the behavioral differences. We suggest that dyslexia is best viewed as one of many expressions of ordinary ubiquitous individual differences in normal developmental outcomes. Thus, terms such as &ldquo;dysfunctional&rdquo; or &ldquo;abnormal&rdquo; are not justified when referring to the brains of persons with dyslexia.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The effects of red surrounds on visual magnocellular and parvocellular cortical processing and perception.More than 50 years ago, Hubel and Wiesel identified a subpopulation of geniculate magnocellular (M) neurons that are suppressed by diffuse red light. Since then, many human psychophysical studies have used red and green backgrounds to study the effects of M suppression on visual task performance, as a means to better understand neurodevelopmental disorders such as dyslexia and schizophrenia. Few of these studies have explicitly assessed the relative effects of red backgrounds on the M and P (parvocellular) pathways. Here we compared the effects of red and green diffuse background illumination on well-accepted cortical M and P signatures, both physiologically through nonlinear analysis of visual evoked potentials (VEPs; N = 15), and psychophysically through pulsed and steady pedestal perceptual thresholds (N = 9 with gray pedestals and N = 8 with colored pedestals). Red surrounds reduced P-generated temporal nonlinearity in the VEPs, but they did not influence M-generated VEP signatures. The steady and pulsed pedestal results suggest that red surrounds can have different effects on M and P contrast sensitivities, depending on whether the target is colored gray or red, presented centrally or peripherally, or whether it is brighter or dimmer than the surround. Our results highlight difficulties in interpreting the effects of red backgrounds on human VEPs or perception in terms of M specific suppression.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Attitudes and intentions of Greek teachers towards teaching pupils with dyslexia: An application of the theory of planned behaviour.The present study aims to examine Greek public primary school teachers' attitudes and intention towards teaching pupils with dyslexia using a model of the theory of planned behaviour (TPB). Toward that aim, 304 teachers aged between 22 and 59 years old, with an average overall work experience of 16.6 years completed a TPB questionnaire which assessed their attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control, their intention, as well as other exogenous factors. The validity and the reliability of the questionnaire were found to be adequate. Overall, the participating teachers report a wide range of educational interventions for pupils with dyslexia emphasizing the psychological aspects of support. They also face a number of barriers, but in general they express neutral to positive attitudes to dyslexia. Results show that attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control significantly predicted the teachers' intention towards teaching dyslexic pupils, thus confirming the applicability of the selected TPB model. Recommendations for teachers' training and limitations of the study are discussed.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Detection of neurodevelopmental diversity in memory clinics-Validation of a self-report measure.Neurodevelopmental learning and attentional disorders (NLAD) such as dyslexia, dyscalculia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affect at least 6% of the adult population or more. They are associated with atypical cognitive patterns in early and adult life. The cognitive patterns of affected individuals in late life have never been described. One main challenge is detecting individuals in clinical settings during which mild cognitive changes could be confounding the clinical presentation. This is a critical research gap because these conditions interact, across the life course, with an individual's risk for dementia. Also, learning disabilities which present in childhood pose persistent cognitive differences in areas involving executive function, reading and math. Clinicians lack tools to detect undiagnosed neurodevelopmental in adults with memory disorders. The majority of patients presenting at memory clinics today come from a generation during which NLAD were not yet clinically recognized. In this study, we hypothesized that a self-report scale can detect NLAD in a memory clinic population.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Optimizing text for an individual's visual system: The contribution of visual crowding to reading difficulties.Reading is a complex process that involves low-level visual processing, phonological processing, and higher-level semantic processing. Given that skilled reading requires integrating information among these different systems, it is likely that reading difficulty-known as dyslexia-can emerge from impairments at any stage of the reading circuitry. To understand contributing factors to reading difficulties within individuals, it is necessary to diagnose the function of each component of the reading circuitry. Here, we investigated whether adults with dyslexia who have impairments in visual processing respond to a visual manipulation specifically targeting their impairment. We collected psychophysical measures of visual crowding and tested how each individual's reading performance was affected by increased text-spacing, a manipulation designed to alleviate severe crowding. Critically, we identified a sub-group of individuals with dyslexia showing elevated crowding and found that these individuals read faster when text was rendered with increased letter-, word- and line-spacing. Our findings point to a subtype of dyslexia involving elevated crowding and demonstrate that individuals benefit from interventions personalized to their specific impairments.\n",

Fifty-four readers with dyslexia in Grades 5 and 6 were compared with 54 chronological age-matched (CA) typical readers on the following measures of cognitive-linguistic and literacy skills: morphological awareness, phonological awareness, visual-orthographic knowledge, rapid naming, vocabulary knowledge, verbal short-term memory (STM), Chinese word reading, and dictation (or spelling). The results indicated that early adolescent readers with dyslexia performed less well than the typical readers on all cognitive-linguistic and literacy measures except the phonological measures. Both groups' scores showed substantial correlations between morphological awareness and Chinese word reading and dictation. Visual-orthographic knowledge and rapid naming were also associated with dictation in early adolescent readers with and without dyslexia, respectively. Moderated multiple regression analyses further revealed that morphological awareness and rapid naming explained unique variance in word reading and dictation for the readers with dyslexia and typical readers separately after controlling readers' age and group effect. These results highlight the potential importance of morphological awareness and rapid naming in Chinese word reading and writing in Chinese early adolescents' literacy development and impairment.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Can very early music interventions promote at-risk infants' development?Music and musical activities are often a natural part of parenting. As accumulating evidence shows, music can promote auditory and language development in infancy and early childhood. It may even help to support auditory and language skills in infants whose development is compromised by heritable conditions, like the reading deficit dyslexia, or by environmental factors, such as premature birth. For example, infants born to dyslexic parents can have atypical brain responses to speech sounds and subsequent challenges in language development. Children born very preterm, in turn, have an increased likelihood of sensory, cognitive, and motor deficits. To ameliorate these deficits, we have developed early interventions focusing on music. Preliminary results of our ongoing longitudinal studies suggest that music making and parental singing promote infants' early language development and auditory neural processing. Together with previous findings in the field, the present studies highlight the role of active, social music making in supporting auditory and language development in at-risk children and infants. Once completed, the studies will illuminate both risk and protective factors in development and offer a comprehensive model of understanding the promises of music activities in promoting positive developmental outcomes during the first years of life.\n",

But children with dyslexia typically exhibit other problems, as well, including poor speech recognition in noise. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the speech-in-noise problems of children with dyslexia are related to their reading problems, and if so, if a common underlying factor might explain both. The specific hypothesis examined was that a spectral processing disorder results in these children receiving smeared signals, which could explain both the diminished sensitivity to phonological structure - leading to reading problems - and the speech recognition in noise difficulties.

MEG and electroencephalography (EEG) are closely related complementary methods and should be interpreted together whenever possible. This manuscript covers the basic physical and physiological principles of MEG and discusses the main aspects of state-of-the-art MEG data analysis. We provide guidelines for best practices of patient preparation, stimulus presentation, MEG data collection and analysis, as well as for MEG interpretation in routine clinical examinations. In 2017, about 200 whole-scalp MEG devices were in operation worldwide, many of them located in clinical environments. Yet, the established clinical indications for MEG examinations remain few, mainly restricted to the diagnostics of epilepsy and to preoperative functional evaluation of neurosurgical patients. We are confident that the extensive ongoing basic MEG research indicates potential for the evaluation of neurological and psychiatric syndromes, developmental disorders, and the integrity of cortical brain networks after stroke. Basic and clinical research is, thus, paving way for new clinical applications to be identified by an increasing number of practitioners of MEG.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Alterations in white matter pathways underlying phonological and morphological processing in Chinese developmental dyslexia.Chinese is a logographic language that is different from alphabetic languages in visual and semantic complexity. Thus far, it is still unclear whether Chinese children with dyslexia show similar disruption of white matter pathways as in alphabetic languages. The present study focused on the alteration of white matter pathways in Chinese children with dyslexia. Using diffusion tensor imaging tractography, the bilateral arcuate fasciculus (AF-anterior, AF-posterior and AF-direct segments), inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) and inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) were delineated in each individual's native space. Compared with age-matched controls, Chinese children with dyslexia showed reduced fractional anisotropy in the left AF-direct and the left ILF. Further regression analyses revealed a functional dissociation between the left AF-direct and the left ILF. The AF-direct tract integrity was associated with phonological processing skill, an ability important for reading in all writing systems, while the ILF integrity was associated with morphological processing skill, an ability more strongly recruited for Chinese reading. In conclusion, the double disruption locus in Chinese children with dyslexia, and the functional dissociation between dorsal and ventral pathways reflect both universal and specific properties of reading in Chinese.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Orthographic learning in children with isolated and combined reading and spelling deficits.Dissociations between reading and spelling problems are likely to be associated with different underlying cognitive deficits, and with different deficits in orthographic learning. In order to understand these differences, the current study examined orthographic learning using a printed-word learning paradigm. Children (4th grade) with isolated reading, isolated spelling and combined reading and spelling problems were compared to children with age appropriate reading and spelling skills on their performance during learning novel words and symbols (non-verbal control condition), and during immediate and delayed reading and spelling recall tasks. No group differences occurred in the non-verbal control condition. In the verbal condition, initial learning was intact in all groups, but differences occurred during recall tasks. Children with reading fluency deficits showed slower reading times, while children with spelling deficits were less accurate, both in reading and spelling recall. Children with isolated spelling problems showed no difficulties in immediate spelling recall, but had problems in remembering the spellings 2 hours later. The results suggest that different orthographic learning deficits underlie reading fluency and spelling problems: Children with isolated reading fluency deficits have no difficulties in building-up orthographic representations, but access to these representations is slowed down while children with isolated spelling deficits have problems in storing precise orthographic representations in long-term memory.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Prevalence of Developmental Dyslexia in Spanish University Students.A recent concern in the field of dyslexia studies is the lack of awareness and attention to university students suffering from this condition. If this problem is serious in countries where the relative opacity of the writing system allows for an early detection and, therefore, effective interventions, it is most critical in countries where transparent spelling makes such detection difficult, except in the most severe cases. In Spain, the diagnosis of dyslexia is rare among university-level adults. The present study pursues three aims: (a) to put forward a screening instrument for the detection of university students at risk of dyslexia, (b) to determine the ratio of university students that could be at risk of dyslexia by means of two different procedures, and (c) to create awareness for a disorder that causes hitherto unrecognized difficulties for an important subgroup of the college population. Six hundred and eighty-six university students in four different fields of study within the general area of Social Sciences from a public University in Madrid completed a Spanish-adapted version of a protocol including stress assignment, spelling words and nonwords, and timed phonological working memory of reading and writing task. Results showed that between 1.6% and 6.4% of this population could be at risk of suffering dyslexia. Such risk is not evenly distributed across the four fields of study. As for gender, the first criterion used yields 1.8 males at risk for every female, but the second criterion has as many males as females at risk. Women were significantly better than men in word spelling. Spelling was best predicted by the timed phonological working memory task of reading and writing.\n",

Fourteen children with dysgraphia, 19 with dyslexia and 13 normally developing were asked to copy 3 figures: a circle, a square and a cross. An optoelectronic system allowed the acquisition of the drawing track in three-dimensions. The participants' head position and upper limb movements were measured as well. A set of parameters including movement duration, velocity, length of the trace, Range of Motion of the upper limb, was computed and compared among the 3 groups. Children with dyslexia traced the circle faster than the other groups. In the cross test, dyslexic participants showed a reduced execution time and increased velocity while drawing the horizontal line. Children with dyslexia were also faster in drawing certain sides of square with respect to the other groups.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The experiences of medical students with dyslexia: An interpretive phenomenological study.This article explores the experiences of U.K. medical students with dyslexia, using an interpretive phenomenological approach. This project began with a review of the literature, highlighting a void of qualitative research. We then conducted a collaborative autoethnography. This paper forms the next stage in this series of research. We aimed to elicit meaning and understanding from the lived experiences of our participants. Eight U.K. junior doctors with dyslexia were interviewed over the telephone in an in-depth, unstructured manner. Audio recordings were transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed with the aid of a template analysis. Experiences of helplessness and hopelessness were common. These may be a result of a fear of stigmatization and personal feelings of inadequacy. They may also be fuelled by the incidents of bullying and belittling from other medical students that were reported. An important meta-theme was of fear and lack of understanding. A lack of pastoral support was also reported. Their experiences of medical school assessments are also reported. More may need to be done to educate teachers and clinical supervisors on dyslexia.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Second language learners who are at-risk for reading disabilities: A growth mixture model study.This one-year longitudinal study examined the developmental trajectories of English reading in Chinese children learning English as a second language (ESL) and identified cognitive profiles of children who are at risk for English reading disability. One hundred and eighty-four Chinese ESL children from eight Hong Kong kindergartens were measured four times during their last year of kindergarten for phonological awareness, letter knowledge, vocabulary and English word reading. Growth mixture modeling was applied to classify the children based on their growth trajectories in English word reading. Four subgroups of word reading growth were classified, namely high-achieving, fast-growth, slow-growth and low-achieving groups. The cognitive-linguistic skills were compared across different groups with age, non-verbal intelligence and receptive vocabulary in L1 controlled. The results showed that low-achieving groups, who were expected to be at-risk for L2 reading disability, showed deficits in letter-name knowledge, phonemic awareness, and receptive and expressive vocabulary. Fast-growth and high-achieving groups were not distinguishable on the measured cognitive-linguistic skills. Children in the low-growth groups were significantly weaker in phonemic awareness, receptive vocabulary and expressive vocabulary than children in the high-achieving group. Our findings identified specific cognitive-linguistic deficits that were associated with children who are at-risk for reading disability. Implications for the early identification of L2 reading disability were discussed.\n",

      "ABSTRACT A Digital App to Aid Detection, Monitoring, and Management of Dyslexia in Young Children (DIMMAND): Protocol for a Digital Health and Education Solution.Dyslexia, a specific learning difficulty and a disability as defined in the Equality Act 2010, is a lifelong condition that affects a child from the start of education. Dyslexia is characterized by difficulties in language processing (reading, spelling, and writing) which do not correspond with the child's general intellectual abilities. Although dyslexia cannot be cured, there is a consensus that interventions are more effective and have greater impact the earlier they are administered. Effective interventions start with diagnosis. Currently, formal diagnosis requires an assessment by a dyslexia specialist or educational psychologist. These assessments are expensive and are not easy for a non-specialist teacher or parent to interpret. Consequently, formal assessments are normally performed at a much later age, when interventions are less likely to be effective. Combining the latest in scientific research, expertise of dyslexia practitioners and real-time interactivity facilitated by digital technologies, we aim to provide a cost-effective and convenient solution that focuses on early dyslexia detection and management.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Simulation of dyslexia. How literacy and cognitive skills can help distinguish college students with dyslexia from malingerers.Academic accommodations associated with a diagnosis of dyslexia might be incentives for college students without reading or spelling difficulties to feign dyslexia and obtain the diagnosis unfairly. In the current study we examined malingering practices by comparing the performance of college students instructed to malinger dyslexia (n = 28) to that of students actually diagnosed with dyslexia (n = 16). We also included a control group of students without reading and spelling difficulties (n = 28). The test battery included tasks tapping literacy skills as well as underlying cognitive skills associated with literacy outcomes. These tasks are commonly used in diagnosing dyslexia. We examined patterns in the performance of malingerers across tasks and tested whether malingerers could be identified based on their performance on a limited number of tasks. Results indicated that malingerers scored significantly lower than students with dyslexia on reading and spelling skills; i.e., the core characteristics of dyslexia. Especially reading performance was extremely low and not in line with students' age and level of education. Findings for underlying cognitive skills were mixed. Overall, malingerers scored lower than students with dyslexia on tasks tapping mainly speed, whereas the two groups did not differ on tasks reflecting mainly accuracy. Based on word and pseudoword reading and letter and digit naming, the three groups could be distinguished with reasonable sensitivity and specificity. In all, results indicate that college students seem to understand on which tasks they should feign dyslexia, but tend to exaggerate difficulties on these tasks to the point where diagnosticians should mistrust performance.\n",

We report a longitudinal study of 245 children at family risk of dyslexia, children with preschool language impairments, and control children. Children with language impairments had poorer frequency-discrimination thresholds than controls at 5.5 years, but children at family risk of dyslexia did not. A model assessing longitudinal relationships among frequency discrimination, reading, language, and executive function skills showed that frequency discrimination was predicted by executive skills but was not a longitudinal predictor of reading or language skills. Our findings contradict the hypothesis that frequency discrimination is causally related to dyslexia or language impairment and suggest that individuals at risk for dyslexia or who have language impairments may perform poorly on auditory processing tasks because of comorbid attentional difficulties.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Scan patterns during scene viewing predict individual differences in clinical traits in a normative sample.The relationship between viewer individual differences and gaze control has been largely neglected in the scene perception literature. Recently we have shown a robust association between individual differences in viewer cognitive capacity and scan patterns during scene viewing. These findings suggest other viewer individual differences may also be associated with scene gaze control. Here we expand our findings to quantify the relationship between individual differences in clinical traits and scene viewing behavior in a normative sample. The present study used Successor Representation Scanpath Analysis (SRSA) to quantify the strength of the association between individual differences in scan patterns during real-world scene viewing and individual differences in viewer attention-deficit disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and dyslexia scores. The SRSA results revealed individual differences in vertical scan patterns that explained more than half of the variance in attention-deficit scores, a third of the variance in autism quotient scores, and about a quarter of the variance in dyslexia scores. These results suggest that individual differences in attention-deficit disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and dyslexia scores are most strongly associated with vertical scanning behaviors when viewing real-world scenes. More importantly, our results suggest scene scan patterns have promise as potential diagnostic tools and provide insight into the types of vertical scan patterns that are most diagnostic.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Speech-language pathology program for reading comprehension and orthography: effects on the spelling of dyslexic individuals.Purpose Prepare a Speech-language Pathology Program for Reading Comprehension and Orthography and verify its effects on the reading comprehension and spelling of students with Developmental Dyslexia. Methods The study sample was composed of eleven individuals (eight males), diagnosed with Developmental Dyslexia, aged 09-11 years. All participants underwent a Speech-language Pathology Program in Reading Comprehension and Orthography comprising 16 individual weekly sessions. In each session, tasks of reading comprehension of texts and orthography were developed. At the beginning and end of the Program, the participants were submitted to a specific assessment (pre- and post-test). Results The individuals presented difficulty in reading comprehension, but the Cloze technique proved to be a useful remediation tool, and significant improvement in their performance was observed in the post-test evaluation. The dyslexic individuals showed poor performance for their educational level in the spelling assessment. At the end of the program, their performance evolved, but it remained below the expected, showing the same error pattern at the pre- and post-tests, with errors in both natural and arbitrary spelling. Conclusion The proposed Speech-language Pathology Program for Reading Comprehension and Orthography produced positive effects on the reading comprehension, spelling, and motivation to reading and writing of the participants. This study presents an unprecedented contribution by proposing joint stimulation of reading and writing by means of a program easy to apply and analyze in individuals with Developmental Dyslexia.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Reading Derived Words by Italian Children With and Without Dyslexia: The Effect of Root Length.Children with dyslexia are extremely slow at reading long words but they are faster with stimuli composed of roots and derivational suffixes (e.g., CASSIERE, 'cashier') than stimuli not decomposable in morphemes (e.g., CAMMELLO, 'camel'). The present study assessed whether root length modulates children's morphological processing. For typically developing readers, root activation was expected to be higher for longer than shorter roots because longer roots are more informative access units than shorter ones. By contrast, readers with dyslexia were not expected to be facilitated by longer roots because these roots might exceed dyslexics' processing capacities. Two groups of Italian 6th graders, with and without dyslexia, read aloud low-frequency derived words, with familiar roots and suffixes. Word reaction times (RTs) and mispronunciations were recorded. Linear mixed-effects regression analyses on RTs showed the inhibitory effect of word length and the facilitating effect of root frequency for both children with and without dyslexia. Root length predicted RTs of typically developing readers only, with faster RTs for longer roots, over and above the inhibitory effect of word length. Furthermore, typically developing children had faster RTs on words with more frequent suffixes while children with dyslexia were faster when roots had a small family size. Generalized linear regression analyses on accuracy showed facilitating effects of word frequency and suffix frequency, for both groups. The large word length effect on latencies confirmed laborious whole-word processing in children when reading low-frequency derived words. The absence of a word frequency effect along with the facilitating effect of root frequency indicated morphemic processing in all readers. The reversed root length effect in typically developing readers pointed to a stronger activation for longer roots in keeping with the idea that these represent particularly informative units for word decoding. For readers with dyslexia the facilitating effect of root frequency (not modulated by root length) confirmed a pervasive benefit of root activation while the lack of root length modulation indicated that the longest roots were for them too large units to be processed within a single fixation.\n",

      "ABSTRACT A Selective Deficit in Phonetic Recalibration by Text in Developmental Dyslexia.Upon hearing an ambiguous speech sound, listeners may adjust their perceptual interpretation of the speech input in accordance with contextual information, like accompanying text or lipread speech (i.e., phonetic recalibration; Bertelson et al., 2003). As developmental dyslexia (DD) has been associated with reduced integration of text and speech sounds, we investigated whether this deficit becomes manifest when text is used to induce this type of audiovisual learning. Adults with DD and normal readers were exposed to ambiguous consonants halfway between /aba/ and /ada/ together with text or lipread speech. After this audiovisual exposure phase, they categorized auditory-only ambiguous test sounds. Results showed that individuals with DD, unlike normal readers, did not use text to recalibrate their phoneme categories, whereas their recalibration by lipread speech was spared. Individuals with DD demonstrated similar deficits when ambiguous vowels (halfway between /wIt/ and /wet/) were recalibrated by text. These findings indicate that DD is related to a specific letter-speech sound association deficit that extends over phoneme classes (vowels and consonants), but - as lipreading was spared - does not extend to a more general audio-visual integration deficit. In particular, these results highlight diminished reading-related audiovisual learning in addition to the commonly reported phonological problems in developmental dyslexia.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Altered activation and functional asymmetry of exner's area but not the visual word form area in a child with sudden-onset, persistent mirror writing.Mirror writing is often produced by healthy children during early acquisition of literacy, and has been observed in adults following neurological disorders or insults. The neural mechanisms responsible for involuntary mirror writing remain debated, but in healthy children, it is typically attributed to the delayed development of a process of overcoming mirror invariance while learning to read and write. We present an unusual case of sudden-onset, persistent mirror writing in a previously typical seven-year-old girl. Using her dominant right hand only, she copied and spontaneously produced all letters, words and sentences, as well as some numbers and objects, in mirror image. Additionally, she frequently misidentified letter orientations in perceptual assessments. Clinical, neuropsychological, and functional neuroimaging studies were carried out over sixteen months. Neurologic and ophthalmologic examinations and a standard clinical MRI scan of the head were normal. Neuropsychological testing revealed average scores on most tests of intellectual function, language function, verbal learning and memory. Visual perception and visual reasoning were average, with the exception of below average form constancy, and mild difficulties on some visual memory tests. Activation and functional connectivity of the reading and writing network was assessed with fMRI. During a reading task, the VWFA showed a strong response to words in mirror but not in normal letter orientation - similar to what has been observed in typically developing children previously - but activation was atypically reduced in right primary visual cortex and Exner's Area. Resting-state connectivity within the reading and writing network was similar to that of age-matched controls, but hemispheric asymmetry between the balance of motor-to-visual input was found for Exner's Area. In summary, this unusual case suggests that a disruption to visual-motor integration rather than to the VWFA can contribute to sudden-onset, persistent mirror writing in the absence of clinically detectable neurological insult.\n",

The main replicated results were: (1) There was a delay in dyslexic children in processing visually presented letter information, (2) there was no deficit in sustained attention in developmental dyslexics, (3) increasing cognitive activation and reading performance resulted in a faster attenuation of relative alpha power in dyslexics compared to controls, and (4) the dyslexic group did not reveal characteristic focal EEG features when task difficulty was standardised individually.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Dyscalculia and dyslexia: Different behavioral, yet similar brain activity profiles during arithmetic.Brain disorders are often investigated in isolation, but very different conclusions might be reached when studies directly contrast multiple disorders. Here, we illustrate this in the context of specific learning disorders, such as dyscalculia and dyslexia. While children with dyscalculia show deficits in arithmetic, children with dyslexia present with reading difficulties. Furthermore, the comorbidity between dyslexia and dyscalculia is surprisingly high. Different hypotheses have been proposed on the origin of these disorders (number processing deficits in dyscalculia, phonological deficits in dyslexia) but these have never been directly contrasted in one brain imaging study. Therefore, we compared the brain activity of children with dyslexia, children with dyscalculia, children with comorbid dyslexia/dyscalculia and healthy controls during arithmetic in a design that allowed us to disentangle various processes that might be associated with the specific or common neural origins of these learning disorders. Participants were 62 children aged 9 to 12, 39 of whom had been clinically diagnosed with a specific learning disorder (dyscalculia and/or dyslexia). All children underwent fMRI scanning while performing an arithmetic task in different formats (dot arrays, digits and number words). At the behavioral level, children with dyscalculia showed lower accuracy when subtracting dot arrays, and all children with learning disorders were slower in responding compared to typically developing children (especially in symbolic formats). However, at the neural level, analyses pointed towards substantial neural similarity between children with learning disorders: Control children demonstrated higher activation levels in frontal and parietal areas than the three groups of children with learning disorders, regardless of the disorder. A direct comparison between the groups of children with learning disorders revealed similar levels of neural activation throughout the brain across these groups. Multivariate subject generalization analyses were used to statistically test the degree of similarity, and confirmed that the neural activation patterns of children with dyslexia, dyscalculia and dyslexia/dyscalculia were highly similar in how they deviated from neural activation patterns in control children. Collectively, these results suggest that, despite differences at the behavioral level, the brain activity profiles of children with different learning disorders during arithmetic may be more similar than initially thought.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Inhibition and Updating, but Not Switching, Predict Developmental Dyslexia and Individual Variation in Reading Ability.To elucidate the core executive function profile (strengths and weaknesses in inhibition, updating, and switching) associated with dyslexia, this study explored executive function in 27 children with dyslexia and 29 age matched controls using sensitive z-mean measures of each ability and controlled for individual differences in processing speed. This study found that developmental dyslexia is associated with inhibition and updating, but not switching impairments, at the error z-mean composite level, whilst controlling for processing speed. Inhibition and updating (but not switching) error composites predicted both dyslexia likelihood and reading ability across the full range of variation from typical to atypical. The predictive relationships were such that those with poorer performance on inhibition and updating measures were significantly more likely to have a diagnosis of developmental dyslexia and also demonstrate poorer reading ability. These findings suggest that inhibition and updating abilities are associated with developmental dyslexia and predict reading ability. Future studies should explore executive function training as an intervention for children with dyslexia as core executive functions appear to be modifiable with training and may transfer to improved reading ability.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Do all visual deficits cause pure alexia? Dissociations between visual processing and reading suggest \"no\".Pure alexia is a deficit of reading affecting the ability to process a word's letters in parallel. Instead, a slow, effortful letter-by-letter reading strategy is employed. It has been claimed that a visual impairment caused the reading impairment. The present study compares visual processing and word reading of a patient with severe visuospatial deficits due to probable posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) to two patients with pure alexia. A double dissociation emerged between visual processing and word reading: The participant with PCA was severely impaired in all visual tasks but read fluently while the patients with pure alexia read slowly but exhibited better preserved visual processing. It is concluded that a visual impairment does not inevitably lead to pure alexia, and that this syndrome is more plausibly conceived of as an orthographic deficit. In addition, the PCA patient's hypometabolism was assessed, and the interaction of the dorsal and ventral visual stream in word reading is discussed.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Review of EEG-based pattern classification frameworks for dyslexia.Dyslexia is a disability that causes difficulties in reading and writing despite average intelligence. This hidden disability often goes undetected since dyslexics are normal and healthy in every other way. Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the upcoming methods being researched for identifying unique brain activation patterns in dyslexics. The aims of this paper are to examine pros and cons of existing EEG-based pattern classification frameworks for dyslexia and recommend optimisations through the findings to assist future research. A critical analysis of the literature is conducted focusing on each framework's (1) data collection, (2) pre-processing, (3) analysis and (4) classification methods. A wide range of inputs as well as classification approaches has been experimented for the improvement in EEG-based pattern classification frameworks. It was uncovered that incorporating reading- and writing-related tasks to experiments used in data collection may help improve these frameworks instead of using only simple tasks, and those unwanted artefacts caused by body movements in the EEG signals during reading and writing activities could be minimised using artefact subspace reconstruction. Further, support vector machine is identified as a promising classifier to be used in EEG-based pattern classification frameworks for dyslexia.\n",

Adults with developmental dyslexia and non-impaired readers underwent two experimental tasks, one including alphabetic stimuli (pre-lexical consonant-vowel syllables) and the other containing non-alphabetic stimuli (pictures and sounds of animals). Participants were instructed to attend to the right or left hemifields and to respond to all stimuli on that hemifield. Behavioral parameters and event-related potentials were recorded. The main finding was that the dyslexic readers demonstrated asynchrony between the auditory and visual modalities when alphabetic stimuli were presented on the right hemifield. These results suggest that intact reading is linked to a synchronized auditory and visual speed of processing even when spatial selective attention is manipulated. The findings of the current study are discussed in terms of asynchrony between modalities as a neurocognitive marker in developmental dyslexia.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Representational Bias in the Radial Axis in Children With Dyslexia: A Landmarks Alignment Study.To better identify the distinctive characteristics of space representation in the radial dimension, we have proposed a new paradigm: the landmarks alignment task where two parallel aluminum bars were radially presented. Children had to move a landmark along one bar and place it at the same location as the reference landmark placed by the examiner on the parallel bar. The major interest of this task was its capacity to assess space representation in the radial dimension when considering a spatial landmark that oriented the subject's attention toward the orthogonal dimension. The most important result showed that in the radial dimension children with dyslexia exhibited a forward bias on the left bar, meaning a mental underrepresentation of the leftward peripersonal space and/or a mental overrepresentation of the rightward peripersonal space. Furthermore, reading discrepancies were correlated with radial forward bias on the left bar. The experiment was also conducted in the lateral axis, showing a pseudoneglect behavior in children without dyslexia. Our landmarks alignment task had the advantage of being able to assess space representation in a complex environment. The forward radial representational bias in children with dyslexia could have implications for spatial orientation in peripersonal workspace in school situations.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Meta-analytic findings reveal lower means but higher variances in visuospatial ability in dyslexia.Conflicting empirical and theoretical accounts suggest that dyslexia is associated with either average, enhanced, or impoverished high-level visuospatial processing relative to controls. Such heterogeneous results could be due to the presence of wider variability in dyslexic samples, which is unlikely to be identified at the single study level, due to lack of power. To address this, this study reports a meta-analysis of means and variances in high-level visuospatial ability in 909 non-dyslexic and 956 dyslexic individuals. The findings suggest that dyslexia is associated not only with a lower mean performance on visuospatial tasks but also with greater variability in performance. Through novel meta-analytic techniques, we demonstrate a negative effect size for mean differences (-.457), but a positive effect size for SD differences (+.118; SD ratio = 1.107). In doing so, this is the first study to demonstrate impoverished visuospatial processing of the majority of individuals with dyslexia in addition to greater variance in performance in this group. The findings advocate for further consideration of both the presence of, and reasons for, increased variance in perception, attention, and memory across neurodevelopmental disorders.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The Influence of Dyslexia Candidate Genes on Reading Skill in Old Age.A number of candidate genes for reading and language impairment have been replicated, primarily in samples of children with developmental disability or delay, although these genes are also supported in adolescent population samples. The present study used a systematic approach to test 14 of these candidate genes for association with reading assessed in late adulthood (two cohorts with mean ages of 70 and 79 years). Gene-sets (14 candidates, axon-guidance and neuron migration pathways) and individual SNPs within each gene of interest were tested for association using imputed data referenced to the 1000 genomes European panel. Using the results from the genome-wide association (GWA) meta-analysis of the two cohorts (N = 1217), a competitive gene-set analysis showed that the candidate gene-set was associated with the reading index (p = .016) at a family wise error rate corrected significance level. Neither axon guidance nor neuron migration pathways were significant. Whereas individual SNP associations within CYP19A1, DYX1C1, CNTNAP2 and DIP2A genes (p < .05) did not reach corrected significance their allelic effects were in the same direction as past available reports. These results suggest that reading skill in normal adults shares the same genetic substrate as reading in adolescents, and clinically disordered reading, and highlights the utility of adult samples to increase sample sizes in the genetic study of developmental disorders.\n",

      "ABSTRACT A Cross-Modal Working Memory Binding Span Deficit in Reading Disability.Successful reading demands the ability to combine visual-phonological information into a single representation and is associated with an efficient short-term memory. Reading disability may consequently involve an impaired working memory binding of visual and phonological information. The present study proposes two span tasks for assessing visual-phonological working memory binding. The tasks involved memorizing cross-modal associations between nonsense figures and nonwords, and they were administered, with other working memory measures, to children with and without a reading disability. The tasks required recognizing which figure was associated with a given nonword and recalling which nonword was associated with a given figure. Children with a reading disability had a similar significant deficit in both cross-modal binding tasks when compared with the control children, and the difference remained significant even after controlling for other verbal and nonverbal working memory measures. The cross-modal binding tasks described here seem to capture a core aspect of working memory associated with reading and may be a useful procedure for assessing reading disabilities.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Auditory temporal processing, reading, and phonological awareness among aging adults.Auditory temporal processing (ATP) has been related in the literature to both speech perception as well as reading and phonological awareness. In aging adults, it is known to be related to difficulties in speech perception. In the present study, we aimed to test whether an age-related deficit in ATP would also be accompanied by poor reading and phonological awareness. Thirty-eight aging adults were compared to 55 readers with dyslexia and 42 young normal readers on temporal order judgment (TOJ), speech perception, reading, and phonological awareness tests. Aging adults had longer TOJ thresholds than young normal readers, but shorter than readers with dyslexia; however, they had lower speech perception accuracy than both groups. Phonological awareness of the aging adults was better than readers with dyslexia, but poorer than young normal readers, although their reading accuracy was similar to that of the young controls. This is the first report on poor phonological awareness among aging adults. Suprisingly, it was not accompanied by difficulties in reading ability, and might instead be related to aging adults' difficulties in speech perception. This newly discovered relationship between ATP and phonological awareness among aging adults appears to extend the existing understanding of this relationship, and suggests it should be explored in other groups with ATP deficits.\n",

A comprehensive pragmatic assessment tool was employed, targeting production and comprehension (Assessment of Pragmatic Abilities and Cognitive Substrates [APACS]). Participants were also administered a series of standardized tests to assess verbal and non-verbal cognitive abilities, including executive functions and social cognition tests. Data were analysed with the aim of understanding whether pragmatic abilities are compromised in dyslexia and of exploring associations between pragmatic performance and other cognitive domains. The performance of the dyslexia group was poorer than that of the control group in both expressive and receptive modalities. Data showed diffuse problems across several domains, with the greatest challenge posed by inferring nonliteral meanings, which indicates that pragmatic inefficiency is an important aspect of the linguistic and communicative profile of dyslexia in adulthood. Explorative correlations highlighted a relation between pragmatic performance and reading and vocabulary abilities, as well as between pragmatics and working memory. This suggests that pragmatic difficulties are strongly tied to the most distinctive aspects of dyslexia, namely, phonological awareness, verbal short-term memory, pseudo-word repetition, whereas the link with high-level executive functions and Theory of Mind is negligible.\n",

In a sample of 150 children, of whom 83 had a parent with dyslexia, correlation and regression analyses were performed. FR, measured on a continuous scale, was by itself related to all outcomes. However, FR did not explain any variance on top of grade 3 reading fluency. Grade 3 reading fluency strongly predicted grade 6 reading fluency and was also related to reading comprehension. RAN improved the prediction of grade 6 reading fluency, though the additional explained variance was small. Vocabulary and PA fully explained the variance that grade 3 reading fluency explained in grade 6 reading comprehension. Vocabulary explained a substantial amount of variance in grade 6 reading comprehension making it an interesting clinical target.

      "ABSTRACT What is dyslexia? An exploration of the relationship between teachers' understandings of dyslexia and their training experiences.Given that an estimated 5-10% of the worldwide population is said to have dyslexia, it is of great importance that teachers have an accurate understanding of what dyslexia is and how it effects their students. Using results from a large-scale survey of teachers in England and in Wales (N ≈ 2,600), this paper demonstrates that teachers held a basic understanding of dyslexia, based on the behavioural issues that it is associated with. Teachers lacked the knowledge of the biological (i.e., neurological) and cognitive (i.e., processing) aspects of dyslexia. Moreover, a number of teachers mentioned visual factors in their description of dyslexia, despite there being inconclusive evidence to suggest a direct relationship between visual functioning and dyslexia. Further findings demonstrate the importance of good-quality teacher training in increasing teachers' confidence working with those with dyslexia, while increasing their knowledge of the cognitive aspects of dyslexia. This paper argues that evidence-based teacher training, which informs teachers of the up-to-date research on the biological, cognitive, and behavioural aspects of dyslexia, is essential to combat misconceptions and ensure that teachers have more nuanced and informed understandings of dyslexia.\n",

      "ABSTRACT A Translational Framework of Educational Neuroscience in Learning Disorders.Neuroimaging has undergone enormous progress during the last two and a half decades. The combination of neuroscientific methods and educational practice has become a focus of interdisciplinary research in order to answer more applied questions. In this realm, conditions that hamper learning success and have deleterious effects in the population - such as learning disorders (LD) - could especially profit from neuroimaging findings. At the moment, however, there is an ongoing debate about how far neuroscientific research can go to inform the practical work in educational settings. Here, we put forward a theoretical translational framework as a method of conducting neuroimaging and bridging it to education, with a main focus on dyscalculia and dyslexia. Our work seeks to represent a theoretical but mainly empirical guide on the benefits of neuroimaging, which can help people working with different aspects of LD, who need to act collaboratively to reach the full potential of neuroimaging. We provide possible ideas regarding how neuroimaging can inform LD at different levels within our multidirectional framework, i.e., mechanisms, diagnosis/prognosis, training/intervention, and community/education. In addition, we discuss methodological, conceptual, and structural limitations that need to be addressed by future research.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Tablet computer games to measure dorsal stream performance in good and poor readers.Evidence suggests a link between deficits in visuo-spatial attention, and subsequent reading ability. However, all the research in the area thus far has been conducted using traditional, lab-based psychophysics, with very tightly controlled visual parameters. In order to take this research further, such as using visuo-spatial tasks for remediation purposes, it must be established that such tasks can be taken out of the laboratory, 'gamified', and still predict reading ability. This study aimed to determine if subtle visual deficits in poor readers could be detected outside a traditional laboratory, in relatively uncontrolled settings using portable game-like technology. Classic visual search and change detection programs, thought to rely on the visual dorsal stream, were modified to a game-like format. They were administered on a portable computer tablet within the participants' school setting. Whilst IQ predicted reading rate, visuo-spatial tasks such as visual search speed, and change detection, each accounted for unique variance in reading rate over and above IQ, age and phonological ability. These results are consistent with the visuo-spatial attention deficit hypothesis, and provide support for the development of portable computerised games that may assess and potentially target this deficit in poor readers.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Structural and functional abnormality of the putamen in children with developmental dyslexia.There is currently debate with regards to the role of phonological deficit in Chinese reading difficulty, even though some researchers have suggested that the deficit of phonological processing is also a signature of developmental dyslexia in Chinese, as has been found in alphabetic languages. In this study, we examined the brain mechanisms of phonological deficit in Chinese children with developmental dyslexia (DD) during an auditory rhyming judgment task. First, we examined structural differences in Chinese dyslexia by comparing gray and white matter volume in Chinese children with DD, age-matched controls (AC), and reading-matched controls (RC). Next, we examined whether the regions with an abnormal volume in DD showed deficient functional connectivity with the rest of the brain during a phonological task (i.e. auditory rhyming judgment). We found that both AC and RC had greater gray matter volume (GMV) at the left putamen and right dorsal lateral frontal cortex than DD, suggesting possible neural signatures of developmental dyslexia. Functional connectivity analysis revealed that the left putamen was more connected with the right inferior occipital gyrus (IOG) in AC and RC than in DD, suggesting that automatic orthographic involvement during spoken language processing is more salient in controls, while the left putamen was more connected with the left transverse temporal gyrus (TTG) and left insula in DD than in AC and RC, suggesting the phonological articulation -auditory feedback loop is more involved in DD. These findings suggest that the reduced left putamen might contribute to phonological deficits experienced in DD, since it showed deficient connectivity with the rest of the brain during phonological processing.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Anxiety and Attentional Bias in Children with Specific Learning Disorders.Children with specific learning disorders (SLDs) face a unique set of socio-emotional challenges as a result of their academic difficulties. Although a higher prevalence of anxiety in children with SLD is often reported, there is currently no research on cognitive mechanisms underlying this anxiety. One way to elucidate these mechanisms is to investigate attentional bias to threatening stimuli using a dot-probe paradigm. Our study compared children ages 9-16 with SLD (n = 48) to typically-developing (TD) controls (n = 33) on their attentional biases to stimuli related to general threats, reading, and stereotypes of SLD. We found a significant threat bias away from reading-related stimuli in the SLD, but not TD group. This attentional bias was not observed with the general threat and stereotype stimuli. Further, children with SLD reported greater anxiety compared to TD children. These results suggest that children with SLD experience greater anxiety, which may partially stem from reading specifically. The finding of avoidance rather than vigilance to reading stimuli indicates the use of more top-down attentional control. This work has important implications for therapeutic approaches to anxiety in children with SLD and highlights the need for attention to socio-emotional difficulties in this population. Future research is needed to further investigate the cognitive aspects of socio-emotional difficulties in children with SLD, as well as how this may impact academic outcomes.\n",

One condition for fulfilling a complex cognitive task, such as understanding a text, is the ability to maintain and process information, which depends on working memory.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Interactions between eye movements and posture in children with neurodevelopmental disorders.In everyday life, our activities frequently involve the simultaneous performance of two or more tasks. Sharing attention between two concurrent tasks may result in a decrease in performance specifically among children with neurodevelopmental disorders. The objective of the study was to determine whether the influence of postural conditions (sitting condition, single task; standing condition, dual task) on eye movement performances on three visual tasks with high attentional load (visually-guided saccade task, memory-guided saccade task and fixation task) was different in children with neurodevelopmental disorders (attention deficit and hyperactive disorder, dyslexia, and high functioning autism spectrum disorder) when compared to typically developing children. One hundred and four children (26 per group, sex-age- and IQ-matched groups) were evaluated. We found that for the fixation task only, the three groups of children with neurodevelopmental disorders had poorer eye movements performances in the standing condition compared to the sitting condition while no such difference was found for typically developing children. We suggest that children with neurodevelopmental disorders have fewer attentional resources available for performing correctly oculomotor tasks with high attentional load leading to impairment of these tasks for maintaining a good level of postural stability.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Exploring relationships between joint hypermobility and neurodevelopment in children (4-13 years) with hereditary connective tissue disorders and developmental coordination disorder.Joint hypermobility (JH) is a common, though largely ignored physical trait with increasing clinical reverberations. A few papers suggest a link between JH and selected neurodevelopmental disorders, such as developmental coordination disorder (DCD). JH is also the hallmark of various hereditary connective tissue disorders (HCTDs). Children with HCTDs may present abnormal neurodevelopment but its manifestations remain undetermined. This study examined 23 children (group 1), aged 4-13 years, with different HCTDs (i.e., 19 with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS)/hypermobility spectrum disorder, 3 with molecularly confirmed classical EDS, and 1 with Loeys-Dietz syndrome type 1 due to TGFBR2 mutation) and 23, age- and sex-matched children with DCD (group 2). All underwent 14 different psychometric tests exploring motor, cognitive, executive-attentive, and emotional-behavior features. In group 1, 30%, 22%, and 13% patients presented DCD (with or without dysgraphia), learning disabilities, and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, respectively. None had cognitive delay. In group 2, 17% patients presented generalized JH and none had HCTDs. DCD children presented more motor and coordination troubles than HCTDs patients, while quality of life of children with HCTDs resulted more deteriorated due to somatic manifestations and behavioral traits. This study presents the full overview of neurodevelopmental attributes in HCTDs, and compares with standardized tools the neurodevelopmental profile of children with DCD and HCTDs. While the high rate of neurodevelopmental comorbidities in HCTDs deserves attention, the impact of a dysfunctional connective tissue in children with a primary diagnosis of DCD needs more research.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Mapping the intersection of language and reading: the neural bases of the primary systems hypothesis.The primary systems framework has been used to relate behavioural performance across many different language activities to the status of core underpinning domain-general cognitive systems. This study provided the first quantitative investigation of this account at both behavioural and neural levels in a group of patients with chronic post-stroke aphasia. Principal components analysis was used to distil orthogonal measures of phonological and semantic processing, which were then related to reading performance and the underlying lesion distributions using voxel-based correlational methodology. Concrete word reading involved both a ventral semantic pathway, and inferior and anterior aspects of the dorsal phonological pathway. Abstract word reading overlapped with the ventral semantic pathway but also drew more extensively on the superior and posterior aspects of the dorsal phonological pathway. Nonword reading was related to phonological processing along the dorsal pathway and was also supported by a more superior set of regions previously associated with speech motor output. The use of continuous measures of behavioural performance and neural integrity allowed us to elucidate for the first time both the lesion and behavioural correlates for the semantic and phonological components of the primary systems hypothesis and to extend these by identifying the importance of an additional dorsal speech motor output system. These results provide a target for future neuroanatomically constrained computational models of reading.\n",

Performance of children with dyslexia was compared to that of younger typically developing children who were matched in terms of reading age. Results showed no significant group differences in response accuracy except for the reception of place-of-articulation in noise. However, dyslexic children responded more slowly than typically developing children across all conditions with larger deficits in noise than in envelope than in silence. At the neural level, dyslexic children exhibited reduced N1 components in silence and the reduction of N1 amplitude was more pronounced for voicing than for the other phonetic features. In the envelope condition, the N1 was localized over the right hemisphere and it was larger for typically developing readers than for dyslexic children. Finally, in stationary noise, the N1 to place of articulation was clearly delayed in children with dyslexia, which suggests a temporal de-organization in the most adverse listening conditions. The results clearly show abnormal neural processing to speech sounds in all conditions. They are discussed in the context of recent theories on perceptual noise exclusion, neural noise and temporal sampling.\n",

Results did not support the hypothesis of better performance among children with dyslexia when reading text in Dyslexie than in other fonts.

      "ABSTRACT Neural correlates of phonological processing: Disrupted in children with dyslexia and enhanced in musically trained children.Phonological processing has been postulated as a core area of deficit among children with dyslexia. Reduced brain activation during phonological processing in children with dyslexia has been observed in left-hemispheric temporoparietal regions. Musical training has shown positive associations with phonological processing abilities, but the neural mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unspecified. The present research aims to distinguish neural correlates of phonological processing in school-age typically developing musically trained children, musically untrained children, and musically untrained children with dyslexia utilizing fMRI. A whole-brain ANCOVA, accounting for gender and nonverbal cognitive abilities, identified a main effect of group in bilateral temporoparietal regions. Subsequent region-of-interest analyses replicated temporoparietal hypoactivation in children with dyslexia relative to typically developing children. By contrast, musically trained children showed greater bilateral activation in temporoparietal regions when compared to each musically untrained group. Therefore, musical training shows associations with enhanced bilateral activation of left-hemispheric regions known to be important for reading. Findings suggest that engagement of these regions through musical training may underlie the putative positive effects of music on reading development. This supports the hypothesis that musical training may facilitate the development of a bilateral compensatory neural network, which aids children with atypical function in left-hemispheric temporoparietal regions.\n",

      "ABSTRACT tDCS Modulatory Effect on Reading Processes: A Review of Studies on Typical Readers and Individuals With Dyslexia.The possibility to use non-invasive brain stimulation to modulate reading performance in individuals with developmental dyslexia (DD) has been recently explored by few empirical investigations. The present systematic review includes nine studies which have employed transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) aiming at improving reading abilities in both typical readers and individuals with DD. Anodal tDCS over the left temporo-parietal cortex-a region which is typically involved in phonological and orthographic processing during reading tasks and underactive in individuals with DD-was the most frequently used montage. The majority of studies employing such stimulation protocol showed significant improvement in differential reading subprocesses. More precisely, word decoding was improved in adult readers, whereas non-word and low-frequency word reading in younger individuals. Furthermore, tDCS was found to be specifically effective in poor readers and individuals with DD rather than typical readers, in spite of the specific brain region targeted by the stimulation; Left frontal, left temporo-parietal, and right cerebellar tDCS failed to modulate reading in already proficient readers. Overall, tDCS appears to be a promising remedial tool for reading difficulties, even when applied to younger populations with reading problems. Further empirical evidence is needed to confirm the potential of neuromodulation as a successful intervention method for DD.\n",

      "ABSTRACT No evidence for cerebellar abnormality in adults with developmental dyslexia.Developmental dyslexia is commonly believed to result from a deficiency in the recognition and processing of speech sounds. According to the cerebellar deficit hypothesis, this phonological deficit is caused by deficient cerebellar function. In the current study, 26 adults with developmental dyslexia and 25 non-dyslexic participants underwent testing of reading-related skills, cerebellar functions, and MRI scanning of the brain. Anatomical assessment of the cerebellum was conducted with voxel-based morphometry. Behavioural evidence, that was indicative of impaired cerebellar function, was found to co-occur with reading impairments in the dyslexic subjects, but a causal relation between the two was not observed. No differences in local grey matter volume, nor in structure-function relationships within the cerebellum were found between the two groups. Possibly, the observed behavioural pattern is due to aberrant white matter connectivity. In conclusion, no support for the cerebellar deficit hypothesis or the presence of anatomical differences of the cerebellum in adults with developmental dyslexia was found.\n",

This study therefore investigated the cognitive-linguistic profiles of the typical-functioning dyslexics and high-functioning dyslexics with longitudinal cohorts of Chinese-speaking adolescents diagnosed with childhood dyslexia. These two dyslexic groups of fifty students (with 25 typical-functioning dyslexics) were assessed in Grade 2 (Time 1) and in Grade 8 (Time 2), whereas 25 typically developing controls were assessed at Time 2. Students were administered measures of phonological awareness, morphological skills, visual-orthographic knowledge, rapid naming, verbal working memory, and literacy skills. Results showed that, at Time 2, both dyslexic groups performed less well than the control group on most of the measures. Deficits in rapid naming were particularly salient in both dyslexic groups. Comparing the two dyslexic groups, the typical-functioning dyslexics had more multiple deficits than the high-functioning dyslexics. Findings highlight the importance of rapid naming deficits as potential universal causes of dyslexia and the utility of targeting visual-orthographic knowledge and morphological skills in supporting the development of dyslexic adolescents.\n",

Training of grapheme-phoneme associations consisted of a 20-min training program in which eight novel letters (Hebrew) needed to be paired with speech sounds taken from the participant's native language (Dutch). Eighty-four third grade students, of whom 20 were diagnosed with dyslexia, participated in the training and testing. Our results indicate a reduced ability of dyslexic readers in applying newly learned grapheme-phoneme correspondences while reading words which consist of these novel letters. However, we did not observe a significant independent contribution of grapheme-phoneme learning to reading outcomes. Alternatively, results from the regression analysis indicate that failure to read may be due to differences in phonological and/or orthographic knowledge but not to differences in the grapheme-phoneme-conversion process itself.\n",

Twin and family studies have indicated a genetic component, while genome-wide studies have implicated a number of susceptibility genes, most of which have direct or indirect roles in neuronal migration. Reelin (RELN) has important biological functions facilitating migration of neurons. Polymorphisms in RELN have been implicated in related disorders like autism and schizophrenia but have not been examined in dyslexia. We hypothesized that not only RELN, but its interactors in the neuronal migration pathway may play roles in the etiology of dyslexia. Twenty two functional variants across six RELN signalling genes (RELN, VLDLR, APOER2, DAB1, LIS1 and NDEL1) and two dyslexia candidate genes (DCDC2 and ROBO1) were analyzed for association in twenty six nuclear and three extended families with individuals affected with dyslexia.

We investigated the large-scale organization of electroencephalography (EEG) functional networks at rest in 28 dyslexics and 36 typically reading adults. For each frequency band (delta, theta alpha and beta), we assessed functional connectivity strength with the phase lag index (PLI). Network topology was examined using minimum spanning tree (MST) graphs derived from the functional connectivity matrices. We found significant group differences in the alpha band (8-13 Hz). The graph analysis indicated more interconnected nodes, in dyslexics compared to typical readers. The graph metrics were significantly correlated with age in dyslexics but not in typical readers, which may indicate more heterogeneity in maturation of brain networks in dyslexics. The present findings support the involvement of alpha oscillations in higher cognition and the sensitivity of graph metrics to characterize functional networks in adult dyslexia.

      "ABSTRACT The neuronal migration hypothesis of dyslexia: A critical evaluation 30 years on.The capacity for language is one of the key features underlying the complexity of human cognition and its evolution. However, little is known about the neurobiological mechanisms that mediate normal or impaired linguistic ability. For developmental dyslexia, early postmortem studies conducted in the 1980s linked the disorder to subtle defects in the migration of neurons in the developing neocortex. These early studies were reinforced by human genetic analyses that identified dyslexia susceptibility genes and subsequent evidence of their involvement in neuronal migration. In this review, we examine recent experimental evidence that does not support the link between dyslexia and neuronal migration. We critically evaluate gene function studies conducted in rodent models and draw attention to the lack of robust evidence from histopathological and imaging studies in humans. Our review suggests that the neuronal migration hypothesis of dyslexia should be reconsidered, and the neurobiological basis of dyslexia should be approached with a fresh start.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Genetic association analysis with pedigrees: Direct inference using the composite likelihood ratio.The likelihood function represents statistical evidence given data and a model. The evidential paradigm (EP), an alternative to Bayesian and Frequentist paradigms, provides considerable theory demonstrating evidence strength for different parameter values via the ratio of likelihoods at different parameter values; thus, enabling inference directly from the likelihood function. The likelihood function, however, can be difficult to compute; for example, in genetic association studies with a binary outcome in large pedigrees. Composite likelihood (CL) is an alternative when the real likelihood is intractable. We show CLs have the two large sample properties of the EP for reliable evidence interpretation: (1) CL supports the true value over a false value by an arbitrarily large factor; and (2) the probability of favouring a false value over the true value is small and bounded. Using simulation, and in a genetic association analysis of reading disability (RD) in large rolandic epilepsy pedigrees, we show that the CL approach yields valid statistical inference and identifies RD associated variants. When compared to analyses using generalized estimating equations, results show a similar prioritization of SNPs, although the CL approach provides additional complementary information, and more intuitive solutions to the multiple hypothesis testing problem.\n",

This study addresses this issue by using imputation methods whereby whole data sets of a trial, or distinct electrodes, are not removed from the analysis of the EEG data but are replaced. We present different imputation strategies but use only two which are optimal for this particular study; predictive mean matching and data augmentation. The study addresses the as of yet unresolved question if the quality of derived brain functional networks is improved by imputation methods compared to traditional exclusion techniques which drop data, and will finally assesses the differences between the two imputation methods themselves used here. In this study, EEG data from a study evaluating dyslexia-specific therapy on a neurophysiological level were used to investigate imputation strategies in research of cortical interaction. Several recorded values were artificially declared as 'missing'. This enables the comparison of networks based on the complete data set without any missing values (pseudo ground truth) and those derived from imputation approaches in a realistic situation of disturbed data. Functional connectivity was quantified by time-variant partial directed coherence, providing a directed, temporally varying and frequency-selective connectivity measure. Based on the comparison between pseudo ground truth and networks of data with excluded missing values and data with imputed values, we found that any imputation strategy is preferable to the entire exclusion of data. The study also showed that the choice of the applied imputation algorithm impacts the resulting networks only marginally.\n",

      "ABSTRACT White matter network connectivity deficits in developmental dyslexia.A number of studies have shown an abnormal connectivity of certain white matter pathways in developmental dyslexia, as well as correlations between these white matter pathways and behavioral deficits. However, whether developmental dyslexia presents broader white matter network connectivity disruption is currently unknown. The present study reconstructed white matter networks for 26 dyslexic children (11.61 ± 1.31 years) and 31 age-matched controls (11.49 ± 1.36 years) using constrained spherical deconvolution tractography. Network-based statistics (NBS) analysis was performed to identify network connectivity deficits in dyslexic individuals. Network topological features were measured based on graph theory to examine whether these parameters correlate with literacy skills, and whether they explain additional variance over previously established white matter connectivity abnormalities in dyslexic children. The NBS analysis identified a network connecting the left-occipital-temporal cortex and temporo-parietal cortex that had decreased streamlines in dyslexic children. Four network topological parameters (clustering coefficient, local efficiency, transitivity, and global efficiency) were positively correlated with literacy skills of dyslexic children, and explained a substantial proportion of additional variance in literacy skills beyond connectivity measures of white matter pathways. This study for the first time reports a disconnection in a local subnetwork in the left hemisphere in dyslexia and shows that the global white matter network topological properties contribute to reduced literacy skills in dyslexic children.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Reading disability due to an ocular motor disorder: A case of an adolescent girl with a previous diagnosis of dyslexia.Dyslexia is a reading disability characterized by difficulties with accurate and/or fluent word recognition, which are thought to stem from a phonological processing impairment. Herein we report the case of a 13-year-old girl who received the diagnosis of dyslexia at age 12 years. We considered this diagnosis to be incorrect because her reading difficulty was caused by a spontaneously repeated eye movement toward the vertical direction; the eyes were likely to show slow, upward drifts followed by quick downward movement at the physical examination, and the amplitude of the downward movement was increased when she changed eye positions to look at the upper direction in the evaluation of the eye tracker. Although we considered there was the possibility that the spontaneously repeated eye movement was classified as the spontaneous downbeat nystagmus, the eye tracker showed the transition of the gaze starting from and returning to was inconsistent with nystagmus, and we concluded that the term of nystagmus like abnormal eye movement was appropriate for the expression of the spontaneously repeated eye movement. There was no apparent abnormality on head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and whole exome sequencing showed no known candidate genes to explain the cerebellar dysfunction. An accumulation of similar cases in the future should help elucidate the pathomechanism observed in this case, and we should fully pay attention to evaluate the neurological aspects of the patients before settling on the diagnosis of dyslexia.\n",

      "ABSTRACT White matter alterations and tract lateralization in children with dyslexia and isolated spelling deficits.The present study investigated whether children with a typical dyslexia profile and children with isolated spelling deficits show a distinct pattern of white matter alteration compared with typically developing peers. Relevant studies on the topic are scarce, rely on small samples, and often suffer from the limitations of conventional tensor-based methods. The present Constrained Spherical Deconvolution study includes 27 children with typical reading and spelling skills, 21 children with dyslexia and 21 children with isolated spelling deficits. Group differences along major white matter tracts were quantified utilizing the Automated Fiber Quantification software and a lateralization index was calculated in order to investigate the structural asymmetry of the tracts. The two deficit groups mostly displayed different patterns of white matter alterations, located in the bilateral inferior longitudinal fasciculi, right superior longitudinal fasciculus, and cingulum for the group with dyslexia and in the left arcuate fasciculus for the group with isolated spelling deficits. The two deficit groups differed also with respect to structural asymmetry. Children with dyslexia did not show the typical leftward asymmetry of the arcuate fasciculus, whereas the group with isolated spelling deficits showed absent rightward asymmetry of the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. This study adds evidence to the notion that different profiles of combined or isolated reading and spelling deficits are associated with different neural signatures.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Increased reliance on a right hemispheric mechanism during idiom processing in adults with dyslexia.Previous studies on adults with dyslexia (DYS) have indicated difficulties in the comprehension of figurative language. Using the divided visual field paradigm, the present study investigated the hemispheric processing of idioms among 22 adults with DYS and 21 regular reader (RR) adults. Participants performed a lexical decision task for a target word related to either a literal or a figurative interpretation of an idiom. The results show that whereas the RR group demonstrated a bilateral pattern of hemispheric processing of idiomatic meanings, the DYS group showed a right hemisphere (RH) advantage. Furthermore, both groups demonstrated the typical RH advantage in processing the literal meanings of idioms. Our findings indicate increased recruitment of the RH in dyslexia, probably due to differences in cerebral language areas or weaker LH semantic processing.\n",

Statistically significant multivariate analysis effects were obtained for country, training, teaching experience with dyslexic learners, and school type. Unlike overall teaching experience and completed level of education (degree), the type of teaching experience with dyslexic EFL learners (direct contact and personal involvement in teaching) seems to shape the perception of teacher preparedness to successfully include these learners. Other interesting tendencies were identified such as between-country differences concerning sources of prior professional knowledge on EFL and dyslexia as well as preferences for particular modes of training. The paper highlights the demand for professional training on EFL and dyslexia as this was confirmed across the three countries.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Enhanced semantic involvement during word recognition in children with dyslexia.We investigated whether children with dyslexia show enhanced semantic involvement as compensation for deficient phonological processing during reading. Phonological and semantic processing during reading and moderating effects of word frequency and word length in children with and without dyslexia were examined using a picture-word priming paradigm. Participants were 61 children with dyslexia and 50 typical readers in Grade 6 of primary school. Primes were either semantically or phonologically (shared onset and rime) related or unrelated to their target word. Results showed that priming effects were stronger in children with dyslexia than in typical readers in the semantic condition but did not differ between groups in the phonological condition. Overall, word length and word frequency effects were stronger for children with dyslexia than for typical readers, but word length and word frequency did not affect priming effects differently for the two groups. In both groups, only semantic priming effects were stronger for low-frequency longer words. Finally, individual word and pseudoword reading efficiency correlated with priming effects only in the semantic condition and only in children with dyslexia. It can be concluded that children with dyslexia, compared with typical readers, rely more on semantic information in word reading but do not show deficient phonological activation during reading compared with typical readers.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Decreased functional connectivity of the salience network during narrative comprehension in children with reading difficulties: An fMRI study.Dyslexia is a neurobiological learning disability, reflected through deficits in written (i.e. reading) but not in spoken language. Since written and spoken language rely on cognitive control abilities, we aimed to compare functional connectivity of the understudied salience network which is related to cognitive control in children with dyslexia vs. typical readers during a functional MRI narrative comprehension task. Although children with dyslexia showed similar comprehension levels as typical readers, neuroimaging data revealed children with dyslexia showed significantly decreased functional connectivity values of an independent component (IC) related to the salience network. The functional connectivity values in the salience network IC were negatively correlated with behavioral data of working memory in those with dyslexia. These findings further express that dyslexia is manifested through atypical involvement of neural circuits related to EF, specifically the salience network even when attending narratives. Since the salience network is related to switching abilities and error detection, future research should focus on strengthening these abilities early in life for better future reading outcomes.\n",

However, the test involves reading numbers, and little is known about variation in baseline performance on the K-D by reading skill level. We conducted a cross-sectional study analyzing data from the Concussion Assessment, Research and Education (CARE) Consortium to assess differences in baseline performance on the K-D associated with factors that impact reading skill level (learning disorder [LD] and primary home language other than English [PHLOTE]), while controlling for covariates (gender, type of sport, attentional issues, history of concussion and modality of administration). We had a sample of 2311 student-athletes (47% female), and multivariate regression indicated an average K-D performance time of 40.4 s. Presence of LD was associated with a 3.3 s slower K-D time (95% CI 1.9-4.7, p < 0.001), and PHLOTE was associated with a 2.6 s slower K-D time (95% CI 1.2-4.0, p < 0.001), after controlling for other covariates. These results suggest caution in the use of normative data with the K-D. Future studies should explore the impact of factors associated with reading skill level on sensitivity of the K-D in detecting concussion.\n",

Concurrent validity was determined via correlations between the DCCC and the verbal comprehension index (VCI), and Chinese achievement. The reliability of the DCCC was assessed via test-retest reliability and internal consistency.

      "ABSTRACT When Trustworthy Information Becomes Inaccessible: The Search Behaviour of Users with Dyslexia in an Online Encyclopedia.The ability to search for trustworthy information has become increasingly important. Access to information is key for a democratic, inclusive society. However, poorly designed search user interfaces exclude certain user groups. For instance, search systems with high demands for correctly spelled queries have been reported to be challenging for people with reading and spelling difficulties, such as dyslexia. In a qualitative pre-study, four adults with dyslexia were interviewed about their search experiences in an encyclopedia with low tolerance for spelling errors. The participants regarded the encyclopedia as highly credible and preferred using this source for factual queries. Nevertheless, the users with dyslexia were highly dependent on Google due to high spelling demands in the encyclopedia search interface. Although the participants found relevant information on Google, they reported the search process as tiresome, since the result list assessment required a significant amount of reading. In contrast, searching the encyclopedia provided direct access to neutral, evaluated information, thus removing the evaluation phase. Moreover, searching was frequently associated with feelings such as fatigue, frustrations and failure. Results from this study imply that search user interface design affects the information searching behavior of people with dyslexia.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Toward the Language Oscillogenome.Language has been argued to arise, both ontogenetically and phylogenetically, from specific patterns of brain wiring. We argue that it can further be shown that core features of language processing emerge from particular phasal and cross-frequency coupling properties of neural oscillations; what has been referred to as the language 'oscillome.' It is expected that basic aspects of the language oscillome result from genetic guidance, what we will here call the language 'oscillogenome,' for which we will put forward a list of candidate genes. We have considered genes for altered brain rhythmicity in conditions involving language deficits: autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, specific language impairment and dyslexia. These selected genes map on to aspects of brain function, particularly on to neurotransmitter function. We stress that caution should be adopted in the construction of any oscillogenome, given the range of potential roles particular localized frequency bands have in cognition. Our aim is to propose a set of genome-to-language linking hypotheses that, given testing, would grant explanatory power to brain rhythms with respect to language processing and evolution.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Are predictors of reading impairment in isolated cleft similar to those in idiopathic dyslexia?Children with isolated cleft of the lip and/or palate (iCL/P) are at increased risk for reading impairment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of early risk factors (hearing, speech, and early literacy) on reading performance compared to unaffected participants with average (uAR) and impaired (uIR) reading. Reading achievement and early literacy skills were evaluated across three groups (27 iCL/P, 32 uAR, and 33 uIR). All participants were males, ages 8-11 years old. Those with history of head trauma/injury or major medical/mental health conditions were excluded. Group differences in achievement and early literacy skills were evaluated with ANCOVAs. Participants with impaired reading achievement (at or below 25th Percentile) were identified. Medical record reviews for participates with iCL/P were conducted and audiology and speech ratings recorded. Correlations were calculated between achievement, early literacy, hearing, and speech. Participants with iCL/P had significantly elevated risk for reading impairment (37%); this risk differed by cleft type (0% iCL, 55% iCLP, and 60% iCP). Achievement for participants with iCP was similar to the uIR group. Early literacy risk resulted in lower achievement scores for both iCL/P and unaffected participants. History of inadequate hearing and speech did not significantly impact early literacy or achievement measures. There is a high risk of reading impairment for children with iCL/P-highest for those with iCLP and iCP. Early literacy predictors of reading outcome are similar for iCL/P and idiopathic dyslexia. Current screening and intervention methods are supported.\n",

      "ABSTRACT N1 lateralization and dyslexia: An event-related potential study in children with a familial risk of dyslexia.The rapid automatic specialized processing of printed words is signalled by the left-lateralization of the N1 component in the visual event-related potential (ERP). In the present study, we have investigated whether differences in N1 lateralization can be observed between Dutch children with and without (a familial risk of) dyslexia around the age of 12 years using a linguistic judgement task. Forty-five participants were included in the ERP analysis, 18 in the low familial risk group without dyslexia, 15 in the high familial risk group without dyslexia, and 12 in the high familial risk group with dyslexia. The results showed that although the N1 peaked slightly earlier in the left hemisphere, the N1 amplitude was right-lateralized in all groups. Moreover, there were no group differences in N1 amplitude or latency, and there was no relationship between reading (related) test scores and N1 characteristics. The results of the present study and our previous findings in adults suggest that print-tuning lateralization is a process that is still developing in adolescence. Because other studies did find N1 lateralization in younger readers with a print versus nonprint contrast, the current results seem to indicate that differences in N1 lateralization also depend on the experimental paradigm.\n",

The considered L2, however, has always been a language acquired through exposure to both written and oral forms. The present study examines the case of Italian adolescents reading in Latin as an L2, which is the special case of a dead language with very limited use of orality. As the learning of Latin is mainly based on the acquisition of grammar, this study also examined the relationship between grammatical proficiency and reading ability in Latin. Results suggested that, compared with control peers, students with dyslexia had difficulty in reading words and non-words in Latin. Interestingly, in spite of Latin being learnt mainly through written language, the extent of their difficulty was no larger than they encountered when reading in their native language. Also, despite the fact that students with dyslexia showed relatively less severe difficulties with Latin grammar (as compared to reading), this did not support them when reading Latin words, unlike typical readers. The theoretical and educational implications of these results are discussed.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Diminished brain responses to second-language words are linked with native-language literacy skills in dyslexia.Dyslexia is characterized by poor reading skills, yet often also difficulties in second-language learning. The differences between native- and second-language speech processing and the establishment of new brain representations for spoken second language in dyslexia are not, however, well understood. We used recordings of the mismatch negativity component of event-related potential to determine possible differences between the activation of long-term memory representations for spoken native- and second-language word forms in Finnish-speaking 9-11-year-old children with or without dyslexia, studying English as their second language in school. In addition, we sought to investigate whether the bottleneck of dyslexic readers' second-language learning lies at the level of word representations or smaller units and whether the amplitude of mismatch negativity is correlated with native-language literacy and related skills. We found that the activation of brain representations for familiar second-language words, but not for second-language speech sounds or native-language words, was weaker in children with dyslexia than in typical readers. Source localization revealed that dyslexia was associated with weak activation of the right temporal cortex, which has been previously linked with word-form learning. Importantly, the amplitude of the mismatch negativity for familiar second-language words correlated with native-language literacy and rapid naming scores, suggesting a close link between second-language processing and these skills.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Auditive training effects from a dichotic listening app in children with dyslexia.Dichotic listening (DL) taps information on the brain's language laterality, processing, and attention. Research has shown that DL responses in dyslexia deviate from the typical pattern. Here, effects of DL training and its correspondence to rapid naming (RAN) and digit span (DS) in typical children and children with dyslexia were assessed. Three groups of third graders participated: two training groups, control training (CT) and dyslexia training (DT), and a control group that received no training (control no training, CnT). All took part in testing pretraining and posttraining. DL measures were on laterality, response scores, and attention. The three groups showed different response patterns: minor changes in CnT, change in all measures in CT, and some changes in DT. RAN and DS scores correlated significantly with some of the DL measures, especially with the attention scores. Our findings support arguments that brain architecture for language in dyslexia is lateralised in the same way as in children without dyslexia. However, the ability to modulate attention during DL is weaker in dyslexia than in typically developing children. A training-induced normalisation of lateralisation was observed in free recall in the dyslexia group, which suggests that DL training may be a promising intervention approach.\n",

It is an underexplored language with agglutinative features in its verb inflections. Some information on the acquisition of the language by typically developing children is available, but to date we have no information on the nature of ALD. As in many places in the developing world, the circumstances for research into language disorder are challenging, as there is no well-ordered infrastructure for the identification of these children and approaches to intervention are not evidence based. This study represents the first attempt to characterize the nature of morphosyntactic limitations in standard Bangla-speaking children with language disorder.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Cognitive and emotional challenges in children with reading difficulties.Dyslexia is characterised by a primary difficulty in both reading and cognitive control. Children with reading difficulties also experience a broad range of social and emotional difficulties, such as low self-esteem, anxiety and depression. The aim of the study was to determine whether there is a linkage between emotional and cognitive-control difficulties and challenges in reading in children with reading difficulties compared to typical readers.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The Book Dog and Semiotic Resources in Envisionment Building of a Text World.The Linnaeus University project \"The Book Dog and Astrid Lindgren\" seeks to bring children and literature together and to use the dog as a tool for this. The method involves children reading aloud to trained dogs, called book dogs. By studying the practice of the book dog, we seek more profound knowledge of the importance of the reading practice for children's reading. Such knowledge can have didactic implications for reading practices also in contexts where there is no book dog. In the study reception theories (Langer in Envisioning knowledge. Building literacy in the academic disciplines, New York, Teachers College Press, 2011a; Langer in Envisioning literature. Literary understanding and literature instruction, 2nd ed., New York, Teachers College Press, 2011b) are developed with perspectives of discourse analysis (Fairclough in Discourse and social change, Polity Press, Cambridge, 1992). and social semiotics (Halliday in Language as social semiotics. The social interpretation of language and meaning, Edward Arnold, London, 1978). The result shows that the dog contributes with semiotic resources in the meaning-making process; the text world comes to life for the child through the expanded envisionment building where the dog is central. Since pupils read texts in all school subjects, the study should be relevant for all types of teachers when shaping reading practices that support pupil's meaning-making, also in contexts where there is no book dog. The study can also say something about what engagement, attentiveness, and non-judgemental attitudes can mean for pupils, even they in reading and writing difficulties (Bergh Nestlog and Ehriander 2016).\n",
