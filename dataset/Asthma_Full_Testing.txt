[A clinical trial to determine whether intravenous aminophylline is indispensable in the treatment of Status_asthmaticus_HP].In Japan, intravenous aminophylline (AMP) is considered as the first treatment of choice for Status_asthmaticus_HP, whereas inhaled beta 2-agonist is considered to be of no value for Status_asthmaticus_HP. To determine the optimal therapy for Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, the authors clinically investigated bronchodilating effects and the clinical role of aerosolized beta 2-agonist inhalation and intravenous AMP in 55 patients with Status_asthmaticus_HP. Patients were classified into two groups treated without intubation and with artificial ventilation. Intravenous steroid (equivalent to 4 mg/kg of hydrocortisone) was administered in all cases. Further, all patients were randomly divided into two subgroups according to treatment regimen, i.e. repeated inhalation of aerosolized beta 2-agonists only, and combined with intravenous AMP. In all groups, the duration of treatment was significantly shorter in the subgroups treated with repeated aerosolized beta 2-agonist inhalation than those treated with intravenous AMP. The failure of intravenous AMP to effect more rapid or Profound_HP improvement both in objective and subjective parameters suggested that inhaled beta 2-agonist with intravenous steroid should be a rational choice in the initial treatment of Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Moreover, inhaled beta 2-agonist used optimally produces good bronchodilation several times greater than that produced by intravenous AMP. We concluded that repeated inhalation of aerosolized beta 2-agonists is the drug of choice combined with intravenous steroid regardless of the Severity_HP of attacks for short-term therapy of Status_asthmaticus_HP, and that intravenous AMP may have only minor bronchodilating effects.

Protection against allergen-induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP by salmeterol.The effects of the long-acting beta 2-agonist salmeterol on early and late phase airways events provoked by inhaled allergen were assessed in a group of atopic asthmatic patients. In a placebo-controlled study, salmeterol 50 micrograms inhaled before allergen challenge ablated both the early and late phase of allergen-induced bronchoconstriction over a 34 h time period. Salmeterol also completely inhibited the allergen-induced rise in non-specific bronchial responsiveness over the same time period. These effects were shown to be unrelated to Prolonged_HP bronchodilatation or functional antagonism. These data suggest novel actions for topically active long-acting beta 2-agonists in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP that extend beyond their protective action on airways smooth muscle.

Use of antiasthmatic drugs in Australia.Bronchodilator prescription and sales data for Australia from 1975 to 1986 were analysed. Inhaled beta-agonists were the most commonly prescribed antiasthmatic agents in 1986, followed by sustained-release theophylline and inhaled corticosteroids. Marked increases in prescription sales of these three drug groups over the period were noted. We estimate that non-prescription sales of salbutamol inhalers increased by 410% between 1980 and 1986 (P less than 0.01). Prescribing rates by general practitioners for beta-agonists, sustained-release theophylline and inhaled corticosteroids increased from 1979 to 1986. Prescribing rates of beta-agonists were highest for persons aged 1-11 years and 55 years and over, and increased markedly for children aged 1-11 years over the period. For sustained-release theophylline, prescribing rates were highest for persons 55 years and over. The difficulties in postulating possible relationships between prescribing trends and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP mortality are discussed.

Formoterol, a new inhaled beta-2 adrenergic agonist, has a longer blocking effect than albuterol on Hyperventilation_HP-induced bronchoconstriction.The duration of effect of inhaled formoterol (24 micrograms) was compared with that of a placebo and that of inhaled albuterol (200 micrograms) in 12 adult asthmatic subjects who underwent Hyperventilation_HP tests with cold dry air (-20 degrees C) on 4 study days. On the control day, they were subjected to four Hyperventilation_HP tests to ensure functional stability. On the 3 remaining days, after a first Hyperventilation_HP test, they inhaled placebo, albuterol, or formoterol in randomized, double-blind fashion. The Hyperventilation_HP test was repeated 1, 4, and 8 h and, if the blocking effect was still present, 12 and 24 h after the drug had been administered. The dose of Hyperventilation_HP of cold air causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PD20) was interpolated on the dose-response curve. The magnitude of the blocking effect at each time interval on each study day was assessed by comparing the changes in PD20 from baseline with the within-day variability of PD20 (standardized change in PD20). The Acute_HP bronchodilator effect was not significantly different as assessed 15 min (21 +/- 14% for albuterol and 18 +/- 18% for formoterol) and 1 h (20 +/- 13% for albuterol and 18 +/- 17% for formoterol) after administering the medication. The duration of the blocking effect, defined as the return to 2 SD from the standardized change in PD20, was significantly more Prolonged_HP for formoterol (8.0 +/- 3.4 h) than for albuterol (3.0 +/- 1.7 h) (t = 4.2, p less than 0.0001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

The beta-adrenergic system in man: physiological and pathophysiological response. Regulation of receptor density and functioning.Catecholamines play an essential role in the activation of the cardiovascular system and in the regulation of energy metabolism in a variety of physiological conditions. Many of these effects are mediated through beta-adrenoceptors located on cell membranes. Binding of catecholamines to beta-adrenoceptor increases the concentration of intracellular cyclic AMP which in turn activates protein kinase A. This enzyme phosphorylates a number of other intracellular enzymes influencing cell metabolism and functions. The primary structures of the receptor and its topography in the cell membrane as well as its binding domains have been partially clarified. In studies of the human beta-adrenergic receptors blood lymphocytes have mostly been used as model cells. These cells carry receptors of mainly the beta 2-subtype. The adequacy of this model system has been demonstrated in several studies. In clinical work receptor assays have had limited use until now. However, studies on the pathophysiology of the adrenergic system in several diseases have revealed that receptor alterations may constitute an important factor in the disease process. Measurements of adrenergic receptors may also have increasing usefulness in determining optimal drug concentrations. Our own studies have primarily focused on physiological adjustments in the beta-adrenergic system during Acute_HP or Prolonged_HP physical exercise as well as receptor changes in Congestive_heart_failure_HP, muscle diseases and the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. We have also explored receptor dynamics during therapy with beta-blocking agents. These studies, briefly reviewed in this communication, have led to the following conclusions: (1) High aerobic capacity is associated with an increased density and ability of lymphocytic beta-adrenoceptors to respond to catecholamines. (2) Both short-and long-term physical exercise induce a rapid up-regulation and more effective functioning of lymphocytic beta-adrenoceptors. (3) Administration of beta-blocking drugs is associated with a subnormal exercise-induced up-regulation and decreased functioning of the lymphocytic beta-adrenoceptors. (4) The exercise-provoked up-regulation and improved functioning of beta-adrenoceptors is blunted in Congestive_heart_failure_HP patients. (5) Patients with Duchenne-type of Muscular_dystrophy_HP have a reduced number of lymphocytic beta-adrenoceptors. (6) In Chronic_HP alcoholics the lymphocytic beta-adrenoceptor level is subnormal but during abrupt ethanol withdrawal a rapid increase in the number and functioning of the receptors to a normal level takes place. This sequence of events may lead to a condition of relative adrenergic hypersensitivity.

Regular inhaled beta-agonist treatment in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.89 subjects with Stable_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP took part in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover study of the effects of regular versus on-demand inhaled bronchodilator therapy. The subjects inhaled fenoterol or placebo by a dry powder delivery system for 24 weeks. Control of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was judged by daily morning and evening peak expiratory flow rates, symptom diaries, use of additional inhaled bronchodilator, and requirement for short courses of prednisone. Of 64 subjects who completed the trial, 57 showed a clear difference in degree of control of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP between the fenoterol and placebo periods: in 17 (30% [95% confidence interval 18.4-43.4%]) Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was better controlled during regular inhaled bronchodilator treatment, whereas in 40 (70% [56.6-81.6%]) control was better during placebo treatment with bronchodilator for symptom relief only. Mean airway responsiveness to methacholine increased slightly during the fenoterol period. The adverse effect of regular bronchodilator inhalation occurred not only among subjects who used a bronchodilator as sole treatment (2 were better and 10 were worse during regular bronchodilator treatment) but also among those who took inhaled corticosteroids (14 were better and 29 were worse). Thus, regular inhalation of a beta-sympathomimetic agent was associated with deterioration of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP control in the majority of subjects. The trends to use of regular, higher doses or longer-acting inhaled beta-sympathomimetic treatment may be an important causal factor in the worldwide increase in morbidity from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Bronchodilator, cardiovascular, and hypokalaemic effects of fenoterol, salbutamol, and terbutaline in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The airway response and cardiovascular and hypokalaemic effects of fenoterol, salbutamol, and terbutaline given in multiples of standard doses from metered-dose inhalers were studied in ten patients with Mild_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. In a double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study the subjects received 2, 6, and 18 puffs of each drug with intervals of 90 min, and forced expiratory volume in 1 s, heart rate, QTc interval, plasma potassium concentration, Tremor_HP, and bronchial reactivity to histamine were measured. All three drugs produced similar bronchodilatation. However, the rises in heart rate, QTc interval, and Tremor_HP and the fall in plasma potassium were greater after fenoterol than after salbutamol or terbutaline. The maximum mean (SD) increases in heart rate for fenoterol, salbutamol, and terbutaline were 29 (24) bpm, 8 (9) bpm, and 8 (14) bpm, respectively; Falls_HP in plasma potassium were 0.76 (0.62) mmol/l, 0.46 (0.32) mmol/l, and 0.52 (0.39) mmol/l, respectively. Fenoterol afforded no additional protection against histamine compared with salbutamol. These findings suggest that at doses based on those used in clinical practice fenoterol causes more adverse effects than salbutamol or terbutaline. The most likely explanation for these effects is that fenoterol has been marketed at a higher dose than the other beta 2-agonists; fenoterol may in addition be less selective for beta 2 receptors.

Use of inhaled corticosteroids in patients with Mild_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.A double blind, parallel group study was carried out to investigate the effect of inhaled budesonide in a Moderate_HP (200 micrograms) and a low (100 micrograms) twice daily dosage compared with the effect of placebo in 103 adults with Mild_HP symptomatic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Subjects recorded peak expiratory flow (PEF), Asthma_ASDPTO_HP symptoms, and beta 2 agonist consumption at home for a period of seven weeks (a one week run in and six weeks' treatment). Morning baseline PEF (around 80% of predicted normal) increased non-significantly to 88% with 200 micrograms budesonide daily and to 90% (p less than 0.05) with 400 micrograms, compared with 81% with placebo. Evening PEF (around 94% of predicted normal) did not change significantly with active or placebo treatment. By comparison with placebo, there was a significant decrease in Nocturnal_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP symptoms and beta 2 agonist consumption. The changes during the day were less pronounced and significant only for 400 micrograms budesonide daily. No significant differences between the two active treatments were detected. It is concluded that low doses of inhaled budesonide are effective in patients with Mild_HP symptomatic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, particularly for night time symptoms and early morning lung function. The early introduction of inhaled corticosteroids for patients with Mild_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and night time symptoms may improve their quality of life during the night and early morning.

Prophylactic treatment of grass pollen-induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP with cetirizine.In a double-blind randomized parallel-group study, six investigators enrolled 43 subjects to study the prophylactic effect of 10 mg cetirizine b.i.d. on grass pollen-induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The control group received 60 mg b.i.d. terfenadine, given to avoid withdrawals from the trial because of Allergic_rhinitis_HP symptoms. Subjects were included in the study between the appearance of the first symptoms of Allergic_rhinitis_HP and those of pollen-induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The Allergic_rhinitis_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP symptoms, visual analogue scores (VAS), FEV1 and self-assessment data on complaints, salvage treatment and peak-flow values were statistically analysed. Both treatments were well tolerated, with a low and similar incidence of side-effects. During the last 3 weeks of treatment, six (32%) of the 19 subjects on cetirizine who were evaluable for efficacy remained free of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP complaints, and another two (10%) had only a single minor attack. None had a grade 3 (incapacitating) attack. Conversely, only one (5%) of the 20 evaluable subjects on terfenadine remained complaint free, and all others (95%) had multiple attacks, which incapacitated three (15%) of them. Nasal_obstruction_HP, dyspnoea, morning peak flow, consumption of beta 2-mimetics and an efficacy index on Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, combining complaints and rescue drug consumption, were significantly better on cetirizine (P less than 0.05). It is concluded that cetirizine is able to prevent the exacerbation of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP induced by grass pollen.

Sympathomimetics for Status_asthmaticus_HP: should only beta 2-selective agonists be used?Sympathomimetics have become a mainstay of the treatment of Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Aerosolization of sympathomimetics provides as great or greater bronchodilation in Status_asthmaticus_HP with fewer systemic effects than parenteral therapy. Despite the broncho-selectivity achieved with this route of administration, cardiostimulation remains the major, dose-limiting factor in the safe use of sustained, high-dose therapy with these agents. This article reviews the pharmacology, adverse effects, and toxicities of selected beta agonists, as well as clinical studies relevant to the question posed in the title. Although the ideal study to answer this question has not yet been performed, the authors feel that available evidence supports the preferential use of selective beta 2 agonists in patients with Acute_HP, Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP who will require high doses of beta agonists.

[Current concepts in the treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (in the United States)].The practice of medicine, in the United States, is regulated by different concepts when compared to France. Anti-asthmatic Medications_ASDPTO are very similar to the ones available in Western Europe, except the combinations (e.g. Berodual/Duovent), and the 200 mcg Beclomethasone MDls. Environmental control is emphasized, as well as a smoke-free environment. Immunotherapy is not recommended, although actively prescribed for generating income. For the last few years, American and French concepts -and problems-regarding Asthma_ASDPTO_HP are coming closer.

[Treatment of Wolff-Parkinson-White_syndrome_HP associated with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].We performed division of accessory pathways in five Asthma_ASDPTO_HP patients associated with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, for whom the administration of a beta-blocker for the Tachycardia_HP is contraindicated, and the administration of bronchodilators for the Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attack may cause Ventricular_extrasystoles_HP. As a result, the tachycardic attacks disappeared postoperatively, both at rest and following administration of bronchodilators.

[Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Gastroesophageal_reflux_HP. Outcome of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP after longterm medical treatment of the reflux].Over one half of the cases of Chronic_HP Severe_HP childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, Refractory_HP to conventional therapy and without other over aetiology, are associated to Gastroesophageal_reflux_HP (GER). The aetiopathogenic role of GER in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is uncertain, and is only confirmed when therapy of the former induces evident improvement of the latter. We have instituted medical antireflux therapy over two years in 17 patients (17.6%) became asymptomatic after less than three months of therapy, and a further four (23.5%) by the sixth month. Seven patients showed clinical improvement by the third month (41%) and even a greater one by the sixth month, only very slight symptoms persisting thereafter. In three cases (17.6%) there was no improvement after two years of outcome of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and the persistence or not of pathological between the outcome of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and the persistence or not of pathological 24-hour pHmetry. On the contrary. macroscopic Esophagitis_HP disappeared in the cases of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP with good outcome, but persisted in all the cases who remained symptomatic. In conclusion, we consider that medical management of GER associated to Asthma_ASDPTO_HP should be maintained for at least six months (if the Clinical_course_HP so permits) before considering a surgical indication.
[Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Gastroesophageal_Reflux_ASDPTO. Outcome of asthma after longterm medical treatment of the reflux].Over one half of the cases of chronic severe childhood asthma, refractory to conventional therapy and without other over aetiology, are associated to Gastroesophageal_Reflux_ASDPTO (GER). The aetiopathogenic role of GER in asthma is uncertain, and is only confirmed when therapy of the former induces evident improvement of the latter.

[Acute_HP Pulmonary_Edema_HP in a 2-year-old child during peridural anesthesia].A case of post obstructive Pulmonary_Edema_HP in a two year old asthmatic child under epidural anaesthesia is described in this case report. The possible causes and mechanisms of this complication and its management are discussed. This discussion underlines that a minor degree of Upper_airway_obstruction_HP might have been capable of producing Pulmonary_Edema_HP because of the altered lung function in this child.

Cetirizine. A review of its pharmacological properties and clinical potential in Allergic_Rhinitis_HP, pollen-induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, and Chronic_HP Urticaria_HP.Cetirizine, a piperazine derivative and carboxylated metabolite of hydroxyzine, is a potent histamine H1-receptor antagonist with antiallergic properties. It has marked affinity for Peripheral_HP histamine H1-receptors and, at the standard dose of 10mg daily, lacks the CNS depressant effects of standard antihistamines. In addition, it inhibits histamine release and eosinophil chemotaxis during the secondary phase of the allergic response. Results from controlled clinical trials indicate that cetirizine is an effective and well tolerated treatment of seasonal and perennial Allergic_Rhinitis_HP and Chronic_HP idiopathic Urticaria_HP. Cetirizine appears to be as effective as conventional dosages of terfenadine, chlorpheniramine and hydroxyzine in relieving symptoms associated with these disorders and produces a markedly lower incidence of sedation than chlorpheniramine, hydroxyzine and several other standard antihistamines. Thus, cetirizine appears to provide a useful alternative to other 'nonsedating' antihistamines; cetirizine may also have a future role in the treatment of allergic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and certain forms of physical Urticaria_HP.

Effects of treatment on airway microvascular leakage.Microvascular leakage, an essential component of inflammation, probably plays a critical role in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in producing plasma exudation and thickening of the bronchial mucosa which may underlie airway hyperresponsiveness. Several therapeutic approaches are possible to reduce this leakage, by blocking either the effects or the release of inflammatory mediators which induce the leakage. Drugs with these actions might be too specific to be of therapeutic value if many mediators are involved, as seems increasingly likely. Reduction of blood flow using selective vasoconstrictors is a more attractive approach and alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonists may be of value. Drugs that act directly on endothelial cells are probably the most useful, since they would be effective irrespective of the mechanism of leakage. Corticosteroids probably have this property, but whether beta-agonists or theophylline are clinically effective against airway microvascular leakage is not yet certain. The development of new drugs which can inhibit microvascular leakage is an important therapeutic approach for the future.

[Role of beta-2-mimetic agents in the treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].Recent modifications of pre existing Beta 2 drugs and new substances with a Prolonged_HP bronchodilator effect may improve asthmatic treatment, in term of duration of benefit and compliance to medication. Evaluation of bronchodilation is still debated. When single dose of drug is administered, nycthemeral rhythm, baseline pulmonary function are to be taken in account. In case of long term treatment studies, evaluation of the effects is based upon clinical score, sequential pulmonary function tests, morning and evening peak expiratory flow rates. Risks way be related to be related to beta 2 drugs or concomitant therapy or associated pathology. Indications of dose and route administration are related to Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Severity_HP. Question to state if beta 2 drugs may be considered as prevention treatment. Studies with compounds exhibiting Prolonged_HP bronchodilating effect are able to reduce Nocturnal_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, peak flow instability and to improve clinical scores and pulmonary function.

Adrenoceptors in airway smooth muscle.This review examines the roles and functional significance of alpha and beta-adrenoceptor subtypes in airway smooth muscle, with emphasis on human airway function and the influence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Specifically, we have examined the distribution of beta-adrenoceptors in lung and the influence of age, the epithelium, respiratory viruses and inflammation associated with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP on airway smooth muscle beta-adrenoceptor function. Sites of action, beta 2-selectivity, efficacy and tolerance are also examined in relation to the use of beta 2-agonists in man. In addition, alpha-adrenoceptor function in airway smooth muscle has been reviewed, with some emphasis on comparing observations made in airway smooth muscle with those in animal models.

[A second drug in nonatopic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP insufficiently controlled with beta 2-adrenergic stimulants: budesonide versus theophylline].We assessed whether theophylline or budesonide (an inhaled corticosteroid) is the most adequate drug to be added to the treatment of patients insufficiently controlled with beta agonists (procaterol). Two comparable groups of nonatopic asthmatic adults (n = 24), aged between 16 and 66 years (42 +/- 17), were investigated in a crossed, randomized study. After 4 weeks with procaterol + 800 micrograms of budesonide, the forced expiratory flow improved (p less than 0.01), the degree of bronchial hyperreactivity to histamine was reduced (p less than 0.001), the daily recorded symptomatology almost disappeared in all and the number of procaterol inhalations was reduced (p less than 0.05). The combination of theophylline + procaterol during 4 weeks did not improve these parameters from their baseline values. It was concluded that inhaled steroids are the drugs of choice in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP which is not controlled only with beta agonists.

Circulating_immune_complexes_HP in systemic necrotizing Vasculitis_HP of the polyarteritis nodosa group. Comparison of HBV-related polyarteritis nodosa and Churg Strauss Vasculitis_HP.Levels of immune complexes (IC) were measured before treatment in 16 patients Affected_HP with classic polyarteritis nodosa (PN) or Churg Strauss Vasculitis_HP (CSA). The six patients with PN were positive for HBV markers. The others presented Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. IgG containing immune complexes were measured using Raji cell assay. Normal level was 4,642 +/- 509 (mean +/- SEM). IC levels were significantly different in patients with and without HBV markers. When HBV was present, mean IC level was 7,185 +/- 2,472. In the absence of HBV markers, mean IC level was 26,462 +/- 10,796. These results confirm that systemic Vasculitis_HP is an Heterogeneous_HP group of diseases and further suggest that pathogenesis of Vasculitis_HP is different in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and those with HBV markers.

Observations with tinset tablet in allergic respiratory tract diseases.The effect of Tinset tablet (30 mg oxatomide) has been examined in 68 patients suffering from allergic diseases of the upper respiratory tract or from allergic diseases accidentally accompanying different pulmonary diseases. In general the daily doses were 2 x 1 tab., occasionally 2 x 2 tab., a number of 12-16-year old patients received only 1 tab. daily. On the basis of the clinical symptoms, spirometric examinations, and global evaluation it has been concluded that the drug may be used most successfully in seasonal Rhinitis_HP, allergodermatosis, and Allergic_Conjunctivitis_HP cases and in extrinsic allergic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP of children. The therapeutic effectiveness of the drug is insignificant in perennial Rhinitis_HP and adult extrinsic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP cases. The somnolence-inducing effect of the drug is notable (it developed in 50% of the patients). In 23 of the 68 patients weight-gain, in 3 cases each gastric complaint or dryness of mouth developed.

Controlled trial of a home and ambulatory program for asthmatic children.Care of asthmatic children is often Episodic_HP and more therapeutic than preventive. A 2-year randomized, controlled trial involving 95 children measured the impact of a comprehensive home and ambulatory program for pediatric Asthma_ASDPTO_HP management using objective outcome measures. Interventions for the study group during the first year included 3-month clinic visits, education, and home visits by a specially trained research nurse. Control subjects continued to receive regular care from a family physician or pediatrician. Eight-nine subjects (93%) completed the study. Study subjects had less school absenteeism than control subjects (10.7 vs. 16.0 days, P = .04) and showed significantly better small airway function after 1 year. Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Severity_HP improved in 13 study subjects and worsened in 5. The reverse was true for control subjects. Study subjects exhibited better metered aerosol technique than control subjects (P = .0005). Fewer days were spent in hospital by the study subjects admitted compared with control subjects (3.67 vs 11.2 days, P = .02). After 1 year, more study than control families (72.1% vs 33.1%, P = .006) reported that their asthmatic child took responsibility for the Asthma_ASDPTO_HP management. The intervention failed to reduce exposure to secondhand smoke or to household pets. There were no significant differences in medical visits, theophylline levels, or records of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP symptoms. One year after discontinuing the intervention, a marked "washout" effect was observed. Comprehensive ambulatory programs of childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP management can improve objective measures of illness Severity_HP but must be sustained.

Metered dose inhalers for bronchodilator delivery in intubated, mechanically ventilated patients.We determined the relative efficacy of two bronchodilator aerosol delivery methods in 18 intubated mechanically ventilated patients with airways obstruction. Two treatment arms, consisting of albuterol 270 micrograms (three puffs) from a metered dose inhaler and albuterol 2.5 mg from a saline solution nebulized with an updraft inhaler, were compared in a single blind, randomized crossover design. Pulmonary function was evaluated using an interrupter technique. Changes in passive expiratory flow at respiratory system recoil pressures between 6 and 10 cm H2O provided the therapeutic endpoints. Paired measurements were made before and 30 minutes after drug delivery. The MDI and NEB resulted in similar improvements in iso-recoil flow (mean increase for both groups = 0.1 L/s). Treatment sequence, Severity_HP of obstruction, and bronchodilator responsiveness had no effect on relative efficacy. Albuterol caused a small but significant increase in heart rate that was similar following both delivery methods. We conclude that bronchodilator aerosol delivery with metered dose inhalers provides a viable alternative to nebulizer therapy in intubated mechanically ventilated patients and may result in a cost savings to hospitals and patients.

Longitudinal study of near fatal Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The effect of careful follow-up and treatment modification for 45 patients with an admission for NFA has been studied. In 24 of 45, inciting events were recognized. BDP was used by 14 patients pre-NFA. In the mean follow-up of 863 days, there have been no deaths and seven patients have been readmitted with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Six of the 45 patients have attained normal FEV1 and PC20H. Blunted perception of breathlessness, change in VAS ratio/change in FEV1, was found when first measured, but normalized to be no different than that of other asthmatic subjects as airway responsiveness became milder. The CO2 ventilatory responses did not differentiate individual NFA patients from non-NFA asthmatic or normal subjects. Comparison of the NFA cohort with the 1985 Asthma_ASDPTO_HP admission cohort showed that an Asthma_ASDPTO_HP admission within the last five years was a risk factor for a NFA episode.

Care of the asthmatic oral and maxillofacial surgery patient.It is estimated that Asthma_ASDPTO_HP affects 6 to 9 million people in the United States. The nature of this disease makes it a special concern to the oral and maxillofacial surgeon. Appropriate management of the asthmatic patient with regard to anesthesia and surgical procedures of the oral and maxillofacial region is discussed.

Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and pregnancy. A challenge for everyone concerned.The asthmatic patient who becomes pregnant needs expert management to minimize the possibility of a poor outcome. Dr Barsky stresses the importance of good rapport and cooperation between physician and patient, explains the effects of pregnancy on Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and vice versa, and discusses the pharmacotherapy that is often necessary to maintain the health of both mother and baby.

Respiratory_arrest_HP in near-fatal Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The majority of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP-related deaths occur outside the hospital, and therefore the exact factors leading to the terminal event are difficult to ascertain. To examine the mechanisms by which patients might die during Acute_HP exacerbations of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, we studied 10 such patients who arrived at the hospital in Respiratory_arrest_HP or in whom it developed soon (within 20 minutes) after admission.

Bronchial responsiveness is not increased by bronchoalveolar and bronchial lavage performed after allergen challenge.Nonspecific bronchial responsiveness was studied in 23 allergic patients with a history of Rhinitis_HP and/or Asthma_ASDPTO_HP who underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar and bronchial lavage (BAL-BL) 4h (Group A) or 24 h (Group B) after an allergen inhalation challenge. In all patients, the dose of methacholine causing an FEV1 fall of 15% (PD15) was determined at baseline, 24 h before allergen challenge. Methacholine bronchial challenge was repeated 1 h before BAL-BL in patients of both groups and again 12 to 14 h after BAL-BL in Group A and 24 h after BAL-BL in Group B. In patients of Group A, the values of methacholine PD15 after BAL-BL were not significantly different from those determined before BAL-BL. This was also the case in patients in whom bronchial responsiveness was increased after allergen challenge. In patients of Group B, methacholine PD15 was significantly decreased after allergen challenge, and this decrease was correlated with the occurrence and the Severity_HP of the late Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic reaction. Even in patients who showed dual Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic reactions and an increased responsiveness after allergen challenge, methacholine PD15 was not further decreased after BAL-BL. These data support the safety of a procedure combining bronchial allergen challenge with BAL-BL, which can be used for studies on the pathophysiology of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

The effect of inhaled corticosteroids on the maximal degree of airway narrowing to methacholine in asthmatic subjects.Airway hyperresponsiveness in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is characterized by an increase in sensitivity and in maximal response to airway-narrowing stimuli. Long-term therapy with inhaled corticosteroids is known to reduce airway hypersensitivity in asthmatic patients. To investigate whether these drugs also reduce the maximal degree of airway narrowing we studied the effects of inhaled budesonide on the maximal response plateau of the dose-response curve to inhaled methacholine in Mild_HPly asthmatic patients in whom a raised plateau could be measured. Sixteen atopic patients with Mild_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were placed randomly into two parallel treatment groups to receive double-blindly either budesonide (400 micrograms twice daily) or placebo, inhaled via a Turbuhaler, for 4 wk. Before treatment, after 2 and 4 wk of treatment, and after 2 and 4 wk of wash-out, complete dose-response curves to methacholine were obtained using a standardized 2-min tidal breathing method. The response was measured by FEV1, expressed in % fall from baseline. A plateau on the log dose-response curve was considered if three or more data points fell within a 5% response range. The maximal response was obtained by averaging the values on the plateau (MFEV1), and the sensitivity was calculated from the provocative concentration of methacholine, causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20). After 4 wk of budesonide treatment, mean MFEV1 decreased from 41.6 to 33.7% fall (p = 0.0004). The changes in MFEV1 were significantly different between placebo and budesonide (p = 0.03). The geometric mean PC20 increased from 3.4 to 6.3 mg/ml (p = 0.02), but the changes in PC20 were not different between the two groups (p = 0.23).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
The effect of inhaled corticosteroids on the maximal degree of airway narrowing to methacholine in asthmatic subjects.Airway hyperresponsiveness in asthma is characterized by an increase in sensitivity and in maximal response to airway-narrowing stimuli. Long-term therapy with inhaled corticosteroids is known to reduce airway hypersensitivity in asthmatic patients. To investigate whether these drugs also reduce the maximal degree of airway narrowing we studied the effects of inhaled budesonide on the maximal response plateau of the dose-response curve to inhaled methacholine in mildly asthmatic patients in whom a raised plateau could be measured. Sixteen atopic patients with mild asthma were placed randomly into two parallel treatment groups to receive double-blindly either budesonide (400 micrograms twice daily) or placebo, inhaled via a Turbuhaler, for 4 wk.

Thromboxane A2 biosynthesis in Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and after antigen challenge.Thromboxane A2 is a potent bronchial smooth muscle spasmogen in vitro, and it has been implicated in airway inflammation and in the genesis of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. We have examined the urinary excretion of a variety of products derived from thromboxane A2 (thromboxane B2, 2,3-dinor, and 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2) and prostacyclin (6-oxo-PGF1 alpha and 2,3-dinor-6-oxo-PGF1 alpha) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in patients admitted Acute_HPly to hospital with Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and in atopic volunteers after bronchial antigen challenge. Urinary excretion of all thromboxane-derived products was markedly increased in a number of patients with Severe_HP Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP compared with that in a nonsmoking control population, in some cases approaching those previously described in Myocardial_infarction_HP: TXB2, 31.6 +/- 12.0 versus 6.5 +/- 0.9; 2,3-dinor-TXB2, 79.0 +/- 19.2 versus 29.5 +/- 2.7; and 11-dehydro-TXB2, 234.3 +/- 65.3 versus 25.0 +/- 2.1 ng/mmol creatinine (p less than 0.001). Urinary prostacyclin-derived products were also significantly raised in Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. In contrast, after inhaled allergen challenge in atopic volunteers, which caused significant bronchoconstriction, urinary excretion of thromboxane-derived products was not significantly elevated: TXB2, 5.6 +/- 1.1 versus 5.7 +/- 1.0; 2,3-dinor-TXB2, 41.2 +/- 12.5 versus 28.5 +/- 6.9; and 11-dehydro-TXB2, 69.8 +/- 17.6 versus 39.7 +/- 11.2 ng/mmol creatinine. In a separate experiment, less than 2% of exogenously administered TXB2 to the airway appeared as urinary thromboxane-derived products, suggesting that production of greater than or equal to 1 microgram of TXA2 in vivo would be required to increase urinary thromboxane excretion twofold.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Quantitative structural analysis of Peripheral_HP airways and arteries in sudden fatal Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The Peripheral_HP airways and the adjacent muscular pulmonary arteries were studied by morphometric methods in the autopsy lungs of six asthmatic subjects who died suddenly during an Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attack, and they were compared with those of six control subjects who died of other causes and had no history of respiratory diseases. Bronchioles of asthmatic subjects had an increased amount of lumen occlusion (p less than 0.01), smooth muscle thickness (p less than 0.001), and inflammatory infiltrate (p less than 0.001), and both mononuclear cells and eosinophils contributed to this increased inflammation. The muscular pulmonary arteries adjacent to occluded and inflamed bronchioles did not have the morphologic features of Chronic_HP hypoxia, as shown by the normal medial and intimal thickness, but they had an important inflammatory process in their walls that was particularly marked at sites adjacent to airways. Although the functional significance of these findings is unknown, they may be responsible in part for the gas exchange abnormalities observed in Acute_HP Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Methotrexate-induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.A patient with Rheumatoid_Arthritis_HP developed pulmonary symptoms and function test abnormalities consistent with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP during methotrexate therapy. Assessments of airway responsiveness to methacholine during therapy revealed airway hyperreactivity that reverted to normal when the methotrexate was stopped. An extension of the methotrexate dosage interval from 7 to 10 days resulted in an abolition of the Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, which remained in remission despite a return to a weekly cycle after a 3-month period of 10-day cycles.

Emergency room care of asthmatics: a comparison between Auckland and Toronto.We compared emergency room visits for the treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in two large downtown teaching hospitals: one in Auckland, New Zealand and one in Toronto, Canada. We wished to determine whether the differences in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP mortality between New Zealand and Canada were reflected in different patterns of emergency room use or physician management. Emergency room use during the past decade was enumerated in both hospitals, and charts containing the sole Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were reviewed in detail for a defined study period in 1986. In both Toronto and Auckland, the number of emergency visits for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP had increased significantly in the past decade (P less than .015 but the rate of rise was significantly higher in Auckland (P less than .05). In Auckland, 27% of asthmatics were admitted whereas in Toronto significantly fewer (16%) were admitted (P less than .0005). Objective measures of pulmonary function were documented more frequently by emergency room physicians in New Zealand than in Canada (90% versus 48%; P less than .0005). Pulmonary function measurement was primarily by peak flow meter in Auckland and most commonly by spirometer in Toronto so that pulmonary function measurements could not be compared directly between centers. In both centers, however, admitted patients had significantly lower pulmonary function indices than discharged patients. In New Zealand, mean peak flow was 38% of the predicted value among all asthmatics assessed; in Toronto, mean FEV1 was 47% of predicted. In Toronto, pulmonary function measurements were most likely to be missing among presumably healthier discharged patients. Pulse rate, respiratory rate, and pulsus paradoxus were documented more consistently in Auckland than in Toronto.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Clinical characteristics of childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.A prospective study was undertaken of 298 asthmatic children attending a paediatric Allergy_HP clinic in Bloemfontein. A detailed history was obtained, and skin tests were performed. Male predominance and an early Onset_HP were confirmed. Symptomatic Allergic_Rhinitis_HP was an extremely common finding. A Family_history_HP of Allergy_HP was obtained in over 90% of cases. Respiratory tract infections, changes in the weather and exercise were found to be the most common Asthma_ASDPTO_HP-inducing factors. Common allergens were grass pollen (63%) and animal danders. House-dust mite (25%) and dietary allergens (less than 20%) were relatively uncommon. The failure to recognise the symptoms of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in children, particularly young children, was identified as an ongoing problem.

Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Chronic_HP Obstructive_lung_disease_HP: a pharmacologic approach.Changing concepts are emerging that should improve our ability to adequately treat Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. This volume of Disease-a-Month reviews the triggers and the role of inflammation in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, and outlines the treatment of Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP as well as the Chronic_HP management of reversible obstructive airways disease. There is general agreement that sympathomimetics are the treatment of choice for Acute_HP Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The role of theophylline for Acute_HP symptoms has been downplayed, and the role of corticosteroids continues to be debated. However, most authorities agree that patients with Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP will benefit from the addition of corticosteroids to the program. For the Chronic_HP management of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, appreciation that inflammation is a perpetuating feature suggests that treatment should generally be directed toward the inflammation. Corticosteroid aerosols have taken on greater prominence and have been advocated as the first line of approach. New concepts regarding the role of Allergy_HP in the perpetuation of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and the role of immunotherapy in its amelioration also have emerged. Medications_ASDPTO not previously thought to be beneficial are being actively investigated. They include gold, methotrexate, and even intravenous gamma globulin.

The normal range of Diurnal_HP changes in peak expiratory flow rates. Relationship to symptoms and respiratory disease.Measuring peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) several times a day can provide an objective assessment of functional changes relative to environmental or occupational Exposures_ASDPTO. This report describes the pattern of Diurnal_HP changes in PEFR in a reference population, and defines ranges of "normal" between- and within-day variability. An index of Diurnal_HP changes was defined as the ratio between maximal and minimal values, where the maximal value was restricted to PEFR measured at noon or in the evening (N, E) and the minimal value was restricted to the morning or at bedtime (M, B). A ratio greater than normal represented an exaggeration of the normal Diurnal_HP pattern in PEFR. Normal limits, based on the ninety-fifth percentile in the reference population, were larger for children (130%) than for adults 15 to 35 yr of age (117%) and those older than 35 yr of age (118%). The meaningfulness of excessive Diurnal_HP changes in PEFR was examined by relating this ratio (Max/Min), and a similar measure (the amplitude percent mean) to Chronic_HP respiratory symptoms and diseases in 938 adults and children who recorded PEFR values 2 to 4 times per day for as long as 14 days. There was a strong relationship of Diurnal_HP changes in PEFR that exceed normal limits with physician-confirmed Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (relative risk of 2.99 with Max/Min), with Exertional_Dyspnea_HP (Grade 2+), and with more Frequent_HP reporting of Acute_HP symptoms of wheeze, attacks of Wheezing_HP Dyspnea_HP, Cough_HP, and chest colds. In addition, those exceeding the normal limits had about 2.9 times greater risk of having a FEV1 below 80% of predicted, and nearly 7 times greater risk of being below 70%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Allergen-induced asthmatic responses. Relationship between increases in airway responsiveness and increases in circulating eosinophils, basophils, and their progenitors.The inflammatory response during allergen-induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was assessed using serial measures of Peripheral_HP blood eosinophils (Eo), basophils (B), and Eo/B progenitor cells (Eo/B-CFU). A group of 14 Stable_HP asthmatic individuals (beta 2-agonists only as needed) had inhalation provocation tests with allergen (18 tests in total) and with diluent. Serial blood samples were taken before and 1 and 24 h after the tests; methylcellulose cultures for Eo/B-CFU and granulocyte-macrophage (GM-CFU) were scored at 14 days. Circulating Eo, B, and Eo/B-CFU were increased at 24 h after allergen inhalation when this resulted in increased histamine airway responsiveness (n = 13). In the 5 subjects with isolated early asthmatic responses the Eo, B, and Eo/B-CFU counts did not change. There was no change in the GM-CFU after allergen. The ratio change in circulating Eo/B-CFU was negatively correlated with baseline histamine airway responsiveness (r = -0.8, p less than 0.05). Four subjects who had an isolated early response and no blood changes to one allergen developed an increase in histamine airway responsiveness and an increase in Eo, B, and Eo/B progenitors after inhalation of a second different allergen. The results indicate that in subjects with an allergen-induced increase in histamine airway responsiveness, an inflammatory response occurs that includes an increase in the number of Eo/B progenitors. This response, possibly mediated by Eo/B growth and differentiation factors, could lead to the accumulation of these cells in the airway and contribute to the airways inflammation present in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in the elderly. A comparison between patients with recently acquired and long-standing disease.To characterize Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in the elderly, 25 consecutive nonsmoking pulmonary clinic patients over the age of 70 who met the American Thoracic Society criteria for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were identified. Of these, 12 patients (48%) had developed Asthma_ASDPTO_HP at an advanced age (greater than 65 yr). This group with late-Onset_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP had a mean duration of disease of 5.1 +/- 2.5 yr. The remaining group with early-Onset_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP had a mean duration of illness of 31.4 +/- 14.6 yr. On the day of evaluation each patient underwent pulmonary function testing off all medication for at least 12 h. These two groups were indistinguishable by symptoms and medication requirements. Immediate hypersensitivity skin testing to 43 aeroallergens was uniformly negative in all 25 patients but the histamine control was always positive. IgE levels in both groups were not different from those in elderly control subjects. Those with early-Onset_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP had a greater likelihood of previous allergic disease (p less than 0.001) and a significantly greater degree of airflow obstruction in pre- and postbronchodilator pulmonary function testing (p less than 0.05). This study suggests that long-standing Asthma_ASDPTO_HP may lead to Chronic_HP persistent airflow obstruction and thereby mimic Chronic_HP Bronchitis_HP and Emphysema_HP (Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP).

Inhalation of an alkaline aerosol by subjects with Mild_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP does not result in bronchoconstriction.Although it is recognized that inhalation of acid aerosols by subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP can cause bronchoconstriction, the effects of the inhalation of an alkaline aerosol are unknown. When supplemental inflatable restraints (automobile air bags) are deployed an alkaline aerosol is released. This aerosol is composed of particles of sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate with some sodium hydroxide. The mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of the aerosol is approximately 1 micron, and the pH of the aerosol is 9.8 to 10.3. A group of 14 volunteer male subjects with Mild_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP inhaled increasing concentrations of this aerosol for 20-min periods of mouth-only tidal ventilation. Pulmonary function tests were performed at baseline (preexposure), after inhalation of room air alone (control), and after each period of inhalation of the aerosol. A total of 5 subjects inhaled aerosols at nominal concentrations of 10, 20, and 40 mg/m3, whereas 11 subjects inhaled aerosols concentrations of approximately 30, 60, and 120 mg/m3. The mean changes in FEV1 and specific airways resistance (SRaw) for the 11 subjects who inhaled the higher concentrations (average highest concentration 126.6 +/- 7.5 mg/m3, mean +/- SEM) were -1.4 +/- 1.9 and +17.5 +/- 8.5%, respectively. Neither change in lung function was clinically or statistically significant. We conclude that the inhalation of relatively high concentrations of this alkaline aerosol by subjects with Mild_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP does not result in bronchoconstriction.

The mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of the aerosol is approximately 1 micron, and the pH of the aerosol is 9.8 to 10.3. A group of 14 volunteer male subjects with mild asthma inhaled increasing concentrations of this aerosol for 20-min periods of mouth-only tidal ventilation. Pulmonary function tests were performed at baseline (preexposure), after inhalation of room air alone (control), and after each period of inhalation of the aerosol. A total of 5 subjects inhaled aerosols at nominal concentrations of 10, 20, and 40 mg/m3, whereas 11 subjects inhaled aerosols concentrations of approximately 30, 60, and 120 mg/m3. The mean changes in FEV1 and specific airways resistance (SRaw) for the 11 subjects who inhaled the higher concentrations (average highest concentration 126.6 +/- 7.5 mg/m3, mean +/- SEM) were -1.4 +/- 1.9 and +17.5 +/- 8.5%, respectively. Neither change in lung function was clinically or statistically significant. We conclude that the inhalation of relatively high concentrations of this alkaline aerosol by subjects with mild asthma does not result in bronchoconstriction.
Airways inflammation in Nocturnal_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Nocturnal_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is a Frequent_HP problem, but the mechanism is unclear. We investigated the possibility that airways inflammation occurred during the night. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was analyzed in asthmatic patients with (n = 7) and without Nocturnal_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (n = 7) at 1600 and 0400 h. The Nocturnal_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP group had an increase in the total leukocyte count (24.0 +/- 7.0 to 41.1 +/- 9.9 x 10(4) cells/ml, p less than 0.05), neutrophils (1.1 +/- 0.6 to 3.7 +/- 1.5 x 10(4) cells/ml, p less than 0.05), and eosinophils (0.5 +/- 0.1 to 1.7 +/- 0.7 x 10(4) cells/ml, p less than 0.05) from 1600 to 0400 h. Cellular components for the non-Nocturnal_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP group did not change. Between groups, the 1600-h cells were similar. At 0400 h the Nocturnal_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP group had significantly higher total leukocyte, neutrophil, eosinophil, lymphocyte, and epithelial cell counts. For all subjects, the overnight fall in peak expiratory flow rates was correlated to the change in neutrophils (r = 0.54, p less than 0.05) and eosinophils (r = 0.77, p less than 0.05). We conclude that the Nocturnal_HP worsening of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP has an associated cellular inflammatory response that is not seen in patients without overnight decrements in lung function. This inflammatory response together with epithelial damage may be important factors in the etiology of Nocturnal_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Respiratory membrane permeability and bronchial hyperreactivity in patients with Stable_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Effects of therapy with inhaled steroids.In patients with Stable_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, we assayed plasma proteins in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid to obtain information on plasma exudation into the airways. Fourteen nonsmoking patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP who were in a Stable_HP period of their disease and eight nonsmoking Healthy_HP volunteers were studied. The ratios of the concentrations of albumin, ceruloplasmin (CP), and alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M) between blood and epithelial lining fluid were calculated (cQalb, cQCP, and cQA2M). The cQalb was increased in the patients (Mann-Whitney U test, p less than 0.05). In 10 patients the bronchial hyperreactivity was assessed with histamine provocation tests. Significant relationships between the cQalb, cQCP, and cQA2M on the one hand and PC15 on the other hand were found (Spearman's rank correlation: r = -0.62, p less than 0.05; r = -0.61, p less than 0.05; r = -0.79, p less than 0.01, respectively). Fourteen patients were treated with two inhalations of 200 micrograms glucocorticosteroids per day in a 3-month prospective study. Three of them were Excluded_HP from further study because of an intercurrent exacerbation of asthmatic symptoms during therapy. In the 11 patients with Stable_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, the cQalb and cQA2M decreased after treatment with inhaled steroids (Wilcoxon's matched pairs signed rank test, p less than 0.03). Our results show that in patients with Stable_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, there is an increased plasma exudation into the airways, most likely caused by an increased respiratory membrane permeability. The plasma exudation correlated with the bronchial hyperreactivity to histamine, and it decreased after corticosteroid therapy.

Eosinophilic airway inflammation during exacerbation of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and its treatment with inhaled corticosteroid.We have compared the inflammatory changes in the bronchial mucosa and the increase in the airway hyperresponsiveness in an asthmatic patient during the deterioration of symptoms. A striking increase in the number of bronchial epithelial eosinophils was associated with an increase in both airway hyperresponsiveness and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP symptoms. During 16 wk of treatment with the inhaled corticosteroid, budesonide, the patient's clinical status and airway hyperresponsiveness improved. This was accompanied by an improvement in the ultrastructure of bronchial mucosa and a decrease in the number of epithelial eosinophils.

Abnormalities in airway smooth muscle in fatal Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. A comparison between trachea and bronchus.Tracheal smooth muscle from seven cases of fatal Asthma_ASDPTO_HP demonstrated an increased contractile response to histamine, acetylcholine, and electrical stimulation of intrinsic cholinergic nerves; impaired relaxation to isoproterenol, and possibly theophylline, was also evident (1). Fourth generation bronchial spirals from the same patients were also studied, and these results were compared with those of the trachea and normal bronchi (n = 5). In contrast to trachea, contractile responses in asthmatic bronchi to acetylcholine, histamine, and cholinergic nerve stimulation were similar to those in control bronchi. The potency of isoprenaline (IC50) was reduced 9.4-fold (p less than 0.003), similar to trachea (4.5-fold), whereas theophylline responses were normal. The discrepant results obtained may reflect differences in the disease process, including rates of postmortem change, at the two anatomic sites.

The effect of Smoking_ASDPTO on the development of allergic disease and specific immunological responses in a factory workforce exposed to humidifier contaminants.The effects of Smoking_ASDPTO on the development of work related Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and on the production of specific IgE and IgG antibodies to antigen from a contaminated humidifier are described for a sample of 258 workers from a printing factory. Current Smoking_ASDPTO was associated with low production of IgG antibody but with higher production of IgE antibody. No dose response for either antibody was found when numbers of cigarettes or pack-years smoked were considered. Work related Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was detected in 12 workers by peak flow recordings. Six were current smokers and one was an ex-smoker. One subject with work related Asthma_ASDPTO_HP had a high (and one a marginal) concentration of specific IgE to humidifier antigen.

Reduction of budesonide after a year of increased use: a randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether improvements in airway responsiveness and clinical Asthma_ASDPTO_HP are maintained.We have demonstrated recently that 1 year of regular inhaled budesonide use can produce substantial improvements in airway responsiveness accompanied by significant improvements in clinical Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Severity_HP. The present study was designed to evaluate whether these improvements are maintained when the dose of budesonide is reduced. At the end of the original study, 28 subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, who had been in the active-treatment arm of the study were randomized either to continue taking the dose of budesonide taken in the original study or to have the dose reduced. Airway responsiveness to methacholine, bronchodilator requirements, symptoms, and spirometry were assessed after 6 weeks and 3 months. During the 3 months, no subject experienced an Asthma_ASDPTO_HP exacerbation, and there was no evidence of change in airway responsiveness in subjects who had their steroids reduced (provocative concentration causing a 20% drop in FEV1; initial, 2.03 mg/ml; final, 1.91 mg/ml), and this change was not different from change in subjects maintained with a higher dose (initial, 3.02 mg/ml; final, 3.12 mg/ml) (p = 0.39). Similarly, there was no evidence of any change in bronchodilator requirements (p = 0.89). However, after 3 months of reduced steroid use, there was a small decline in spirometry (FEV1 percent predicted: initial, 84.4%; final, 81.5%), and this change was significantly different from change in subjects in whom steroids were not reduced (initial, 90.2%; final, 90.2%) (p = 0.002). At 3 months, symptoms (predominantly sputum production) were also beginning to redevelop in the reduced budesonide group (p = 0.056).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Environmental exposure to cockroach allergens: analysis with monoclonal antibody-based enzyme immunoassays.Quantitative two-site monoclonal antibody (MAb)-based enzyme-linked immunoassays for two cockroach (CR) allergens, Bla g I and Bla g II, have been developed and used to measure allergen levels in house-dust samples. Dust collected from the CR-infested homes of two patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP from Charlottesville, Va., demonstrated wide variation in the levels of Bla g I, depending on the location of dust collection. Dust from kitchen floors and cabinets contained 50-fold more allergen (mean, 10,755 U/gm of dust) than dust from bedrooms and upholstered furniture (mean, 204 U/gm). One hundred forty-five dust samples were collected from the bedrooms and living rooms of 22 children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and 16 control subjects without Asthma_ASDPTO_HP living in Atlanta, Ga. Twenty-seven of the 38 homes (17/22 children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP; 10/16 control subjects) had detectable Bla g I (4 to 1340 U/gm of dust). Bla g II levels were assayed in 40 kitchen, bedroom, and living room samples from homes in Wilmington, Del. Highest levels of Bla g II were detected in kitchen-floor dust (300 U/gm of dust). Additionally, approximately 20% of homes with no visual evidence of CR infestation had significant levels of Bla g II in at least one dust sample (greater than 4 U/gm of dust). Our results demonstrate that CR may be an occult allergen in homes. The kitchen appears to be the primary site of CR-allergen accumulation, but significant CR-allergen levels can also be found at other sites in the home. The MAb-based assays can be used for quantitation of environmental exposure to CR allergens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid mediator levels 5 minutes after allergen challenge in atopic subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP: relationship to the development of late asthmatic responses.Inflammatory mediators have been implicated in the pathogenesis of human Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and have been demonstrated to increase in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid during the time of the immediate asthmatic response (IAR) after allergen instillation in the lungs. However, the relationship of these mediators, measured early to the late asthmatic response (LAR), airway reactivity, and clinical Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, is unknown. In the present study, we evaluated mediator levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid before and 5 minutes after allergen challenge from three subject groups: atopic subjects without Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (N = 7), atopic subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and without LAR [-) LAR) (N = 6), and atopic subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and with LAR [+) LAR) (N = 6). Subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were differentiated into subjects with and without LARs based on at least a 15% decrease in FEV1 between 3 to 8 hours postallergen inhalation. The mediators, prostaglandin D2 thromboxane B2 leukotriene C4 (LTC4), and histamine, were measured both before and after allergen instillation. Baseline prechallenge levels were similar, except in the case of LTC4. LTC4 was detectable at baseline significantly more frequently in the atopic subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP with and without LAR when these subjects were compared to the atopic subjects without Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (nine of 12 detectable versus one of seven detectable). In all groups, significant increases in mediator levels were observed in the groups with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP postallergen challenge, compared to the atopic subjects without Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Atopic subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and without LAR had significantly higher levels of all four mediators after challenge than atopic subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and with LAR and atopic subjects without Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Comparison of cockroach allergenic activity in whole body and fecal extracts.Previous studies have established cockroach allergens as important sensitizing agents in the induction/exacerbation of urban Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The present investigation compared saline extracts of American cockroach (Periplaneta americana) whole bodies and feces and German cockroach (Blattella germanica) whole bodies and feces as important sources of allergens. All extracts were tested before or after gel filtration on Sephadex G-75 columns (fraction 2) as previously described. Skin test studies of 69 subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP with extracts of American or German cockroaches demonstrated a significant correlation of reactivity to whole body and fecal extracts for both species. Direct RASTs of 13 sera from cockroach skin test-positive subjects were generally greater to both German whole body extracts (GWBEs) and German fecal extracts (GFEs) as compared to American whole body and fecal extracts. There was a good correlation of RAST reactivity to GWBE with GFE. RAST inhibition demonstrated that GFE contained most of the allergenic activity present in GWBE. These studies demonstrate the allergenic similarities of cockroach whole body and fecal extracts and suggest that cockroach feces are an important sensitizing agent in atopic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

The prevalence of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, determined by serologic and radiologic criteria in patients at risk.Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, a hitherto uncommon but potentially crippling complication of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, occurs at an unknown prevalence in the United States. Using both modern serologic criteria complete with a history of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and radiologic findings, we were able to make the Diagnosis_ASDPTO of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in 28 of 100 consecutive patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP who had immediate cutaneous reactivity to Aspergillus fumigatus and who were seen in an outpatient setting. Problems associated with use of less comprehensive criteria for this Diagnosis_ASDPTO are discussed.

Individualized aerobic and high Severity_HP training for asthmatic children in an exercise readaptation program. Is training always helpful for better adaptation to exercise?In order to define the role of individualized training Severity_HP in a conditioning program for asthmatic children, we have trained seven asthmatics (age = 11.4 +/- 1.8 years) at their ventilatory threshold (VTh) Severity_HP level for a three-month period (aerobic training) and at maximal Severity_HP also for three months (high Severity_HP training). VTh is the point at which a nonlinear increase of VE occurs. Another group of seven asthmatics (age = 11.4 +/- 1.5) served as control subjects. Cardiopulmonary fitness was determined on a cycle ergometer before and after each training session. This study demonstrated that aerobic training, correctly adapted to the child's physical ability, induces the following: (1) a rapid and marked cardiovascular fitness increase; and (2) a decrease in VE over a given work range so that VTh is increased. This is of great importance because Hyperventilation_HP is a major determinant of exercise-induced Bronchospasm_HP. In contrast, even if high Severity_HP training is well tolerated in an indoor swimming pool, the long-term effects are unsuitable for asthmatic children because the decrease of VTh will involve an increase of Hyperventilation_HP, even when exercise is performed at submaximal Severity_HP.

Erythromycin reduces the Severity_HP of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.It has been demonstrated that bronchial hyperresponsiveness is a characteristic feature of bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, and airway inflammation plays an important role in bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Erythromycin is an antibiotic extensively used worldwide which is also reported to have anti-inflammatory action. This study was designed to clarify whether erythromycin could favorably alter bronchial responsiveness in patients with bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. To estimate bronchial responsiveness, histamine challenge was performed in 23 patients with bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (atopic type, 11; nonatopic type, 12). All patients were treated for ten weeks with erythromycin, 200 mg three times daily, orally. After ten weeks' treatment, PC20, an index of bronchial sensitivity, was increased significantly. There was no difference between atopic and nonatopic patients in the improvement of PC20. It was concluded that erythromycin reduces the Severity_HP of bronchial responsiveness in patients with bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.
Erythromycin reduces the severity of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in asthma.It has been demonstrated that bronchial hyperresponsiveness is a characteristic feature of bronchial asthma, and airway inflammation plays an important role in bronchial hyperresponsiveness.

Indications for spirometry in outpatients with respiratory disease.It has been suggested that spirometry should be incorporated into the routine examination of every patient, analogous to obtaining vital signs. To determine the impact of spirometry on the management of outpatients with respiratory disease, spirometry was performed on 150 consecutive patients (123 men and 27 women, mean age 57 +/- 12 years) seen in our pulmonary disease outpatient clinics. Patients with obstructive (n = 75), restrictive (n = 31), mixed (n = 26) or other respiratory diseases (n = 18) were initially assessed by history and physical examination and classified as improved, Stable_HP, or worse compared to previous visits. A clinical management plan (CMP) was formulated based on this initial evaluation. Spirometric results were then made available to the examiner who could then make changes in the proposed CMP. The addition of spirometric results caused alteration of the CMP in only eight (5 percent) patients; in the remaining 142 patients, results did not Affect_ASDPTO the CMP. Two clinical findings identified those patients whose CMP was most likely to be altered by spirometry: Severity_HP of lung dysfunction (determined from previous spirometry) and deterioration of clinical status (judged by history and physical examination). Of the eight patients whose CMP was changed after review of spirometry, six (75 percent) had previous Severe_HP ventilatory dysfunction (FEV1 or FVC less than or equal to 40 percent of predicted or FEV1/FVC ratio less than or equal to 0.40). In 6 of 38 patients (16 percent) with Severe_HP ventilatory dysfunction, CMP was altered after spirometry while only 2 of 112 patients (1.8 percent) with Mild_HP or Moderate_HP dysfunction had changes in their CMP. Patients who were clinically assessed as worse compared to their previous visit were more likely to have their CMP altered after review of spirometry when compared to those considered improved or Stable_HP by a ratio of 6:1. These results suggest that spirometry is most likely to supplement the physician's history and physical examination in the management of outpatients with pulmonary disease when the initial evaluation suggests that the patient has clinically deteriorated since the previous clinic visit, or when he or she has previous Severe_HP ventilatory dysfunction.

Screening for occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP: a word of caution.The Diagnosis_ASDPTO of occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP may be difficult due to the complex mechanisms inducing the disorder. Identification of the offending agent after historical documentation may be difficult without bronchial challenge. The hallmark of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is bronchial hyperreactivity as detected by methacholine challenge, and this test could be considered as a screening test for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in the workplace. Four cases are presented that document changes in methacholine airway reactivity dependent on temporal association with exposure to the workplace or the specific offending agent. This indicates a need for a careful evaluation of symptoms relative to exposure in patients suspected for workplace Asthma_ASDPTO_HP as well as serial determinations of methacholine response to detect potential variability in the airway reactivity.

Allergic histories and reactions of patients treated with digoxin immune Fab (ovine) antibody. The Digibind Study Advisory Panel.Seven hundred seventeen adult patients with life-threatening digitalis intoxication were treated with Fab fragments of ovine antidigoxin immunoglobulin G (IgG). Results of the efficacy of treatment and adverse effects were collected with standard report forms. Eighty-two (11%) of the patients were recorded as having histories of Allergy_HP (71 patients) and/or Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (11 patients). Of the "allergic" subjects, 35 described reactions to antibiotics, 19 to other Medications_ASDPTO, 3 to foods, and 2 to pollens; in 12 subjects the etiologic agent was not specified. Six subjects had adverse reactions that were probably or possibly due to Allergy_HP to components of the antibody preparation. Of these 4 (5%; 95% confidence interval (Cl) 1.8% to 12%) occurred in the 82 subjects with histories of Allergy_HP or Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and 3 (9%; 95% Cl 1.8% to 23%) of these occurred in the 35 persons with histories of Allergy_HP to an antibiotic. In contrast, only 2 (0.3%; 95% Cl 0.04% to 1.1%) similar reactions occurred in the 635 subjects with no histories of Allergy_HP or Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. All reactions responded to symptomatic treatment. The authors conclude that treatment of digitalis intoxication with ovine antidigoxin IgG-Fab (Digibind) is generally well tolerated and allergic reactions are rare. However, there is a significantly increased risk of reactions in patients with histories of Allergy_HP or Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is one of the most common respiratory problems in modern industrialized countries, affecting over 5% of the population. It affects all age groups from infants to senior citizens, and mortality rates from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP appear to be increasing during the past few years in the United States as well as in other industrialized countries. Asthma_ASDPTO_HP tends to occur in families, associated with other allergic disease, and may be induced by a wide variety of environmental antigens, most commonly inhaled allergens such as pollen and dust. Bronchial challenge with a specific allergen results in an early bronchospastic response with a relatively brief duration, and in a significant number of patients there is a late response with Onset_HP after 3 to 4 hours, lasting hours to days. This late response is associated with a bronchial hypersensitivity reaction, which is demonstrable by nonspecific challenge testing in the laboratory. During the period of bronchial hyperresponsiveness patients are prone to develop attacks following exposure to a wide variety of "triggers," including cold air, fumes, or cigarette smoke. The current approach to management of patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP emphasizes prevention, with avoidance of specific allergens when possible, and Chronic_HP use of anti-inflammatory agents including corticosteroids and cromolyn sodium. The goal is to decrease the bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Management of the Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attack consists of bronchodilator therapy, primarily with inhaled beta-adrenergic agonists, and administration of oral or systemic corticosteroids if the attack is not rapidly relieved. Additional therapeutic agents including theophylline and anticholinergics may be useful in some situations. Response to therapy during the first couple of hours in the emergency room is the most important predictor of the course of the Acute_HP attack, and patients who have not responded significantly after 2 hours of maximum therapy are candidates for hospital admission or Prolonged_HP emergency room observation. The goal of Acute_HP therapy is to wean the patient from intravenous drugs and place him or her on rapidly tapering doses of oral prednisone while initiating a vigorous program of preventive therapy. Follow-up observation, both in the office and in the patient's home, is vital and involves extensive patient education and objective testing of peak airflow. In general, the course of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is relatively benign compared with other obstructive airway diseases; however, significant mortality exists, especially in older patients and those with late-Onset_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Effect of a short course of prednisone in the prevention of early relapse after the emergency room treatment of Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Relapse after the treatment of Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in the emergency room is common (occurring in 25 to 30 percent of cases) and is not accurately predicted by any available measurements. We studied the usefulness of prednisone in reducing this high rate of relapse.

Pediatric Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, a qualitative and quantitative approach to needs assessment.This article describes an approach to needs assessment in a specific location using both focus group interviews and a written questionnaire. In this case study, the target population consists of parents of asthmatic children (0-4 years of age). Six focus group interviews were conducted with the purpose of discussing parents' experiences with health care for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, their beliefs and knowledge of general aspects of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, medication and preventive actions. As a supplement, parents completed a written questionnaire providing additional quantitative information on parental knowledge and misconceptions. Results indicated that parental knowledge of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in general was not adequate, especially with respect to medication, preceding signs and preventive activities. Important misconceptions, which might contribute to noncompliance with self-management behaviors, were revealed during discussions with the parents. Several differences were found between results of the interviews and the questionnaire, for instance regarding parental knowledge about preventive measures, medication and perceived parental satisfaction with health care for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. These differences indicate the value of using both a survey and a focus group.

You Can Control Asthma_ASDPTO_HP: evaluation of an Asthma_ASDPTO_HP education program for hospitalized inner-city children.A self-management education program was designed for staff nurses to offer children while they received medical care for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in the hospital. The program uses videotapes, written activity books and nurse discussion with the patient. Evaluation was conducted to assess program feasibility and impact. Pre- and post-tests of 40 children age 6-12 years revealed that the children had statistically significant increases in knowledge of and expected response to early warning signs of Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, and in their sense of personal control (Health Locus of Control). Parents reported an increased use of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP self-management techniques for Acute_HP episodes of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Medical record review for a 15 month pre- and post-period indicated reductions in emergency room use. Inpatient hospital based education offers a critical opportunity to introduce Asthma_ASDPTO_HP management skills, especially to children not reached by more traditional programs.

The application of behavioral procedures to childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP: current and future perspectives.The development and application of behavioral procedures to childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP during the past three decades is reviewed, with particular implications for researchers and practitioners. In particular, the article describes two major categories of procedures that comprise the current state of the art of behavioral intervention; prevention and management of attacks and self-management by patients of their Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Much of the discussion focuses on self-management skills, particularly the essential ingredients of data collection, information processing and evaluation, steps required to manage attacks and self-reaction to performance. A final section of the paper speculates on the future directions of applying behavioral techniques to childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The need to analyze individual attacks suffered by individual patients is emphasized; in addition, the scientific skills required to successfully manage Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, performed both by medical personnel and patients, are described. It is hoped that the future will see these skills applied in a manner so that each attack is treated as if it were an experiment.

Respiratory problems among cotton textile mill workers in Ethiopia.This study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of respiratory problems, in particular byssinosis, and to explore factors associated with their occurrence among a group of 595 randomly selected workers representing 40.5% of those exposed to dusty operations in a typical Ethiopian cotton textile mill. A standard questionnaire on respiration was administered and pre and postshift forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) were determined for each worker; workers found to have byssinosis and other respiratory diseases were compared with workers having no respiratory diseases in terms of the level and duration of exposure to cotton dust and other variables. Multiple area air samples from different sections were analysed for elutriated cotton dust concentrations (0.86-3.52 mg/m3). The prevalence of byssinosis was 43.2% among blowers and 37.5% in carders in comparison with four to 24% among workers in other sections. Prevalence of Chronic_Bronchitis_HP ranged from 17.6 to 47.7% and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP from 8.5 to 20.5% across all sections. Significant across shift decrements in FEV1 and FVC were seen in those workers with respiratory tract diseases compared with those workers without such diseases. A significant dose response relation for pulmonary function and respiratory illnesses was also found by regression analysis. Preventive measures are proposed. Further research including a nationwide survey of textile mills is suggested. This is the first epidemiological study of the textile industry in Ethiopia.

Effect of therapeutic plasma concentrations of theophylline on behavior, cognitive processing, and Affect_ASDPTO in children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.A double-blind, randomized, crossover study assessed the effects of theophylline on behavior, Mood_ASDPTO, and efficiency of cognitive processing. Thirty-one children aged 8 to 12 years with Moderate_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were randomly assigned to 10-day theophylline followed by placebo or to placebo followed by theophylline experimental conditions separated by 2-day washout periods. Theophylline plasma concentrations and pulmonary function tests were performed throughout the study. Cognitive functioning tests and self-report measures were administered at baseline and after each medication phase. Behavior ratings were obtained from parents and teachers. Parents' and teachers' ratings did not reflect a theophylline effect on attention or activity level; children's self-reports showed no changes in Mood_ASDPTO, and no statistically significant differences were found on measures of cognitive processing. Large individual differences in sensitivity to theophylline effects were present. Although most of the children tolerated theophylline well, those already having attentional or achievement problems appeared vulnerable to adverse effects. Individual response differences should be a focus of future studies.

The effect of indoor air pollutants on Otitis_ASDPTO_media_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in children.This case-control study investigated the possible association between home environmental air pollutants and their effect on Otitis_ASDPTO_media_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in children. Patients with physician-diagnosed Otitis_ASDPTO (n = 125, 74% response), with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (n = 137, 80% response), and controls (n = 237, 72% response) from a private pediatric practice seen between October 1986 and May 1987 were studied. A questionnaire inquired about housing characteristics (i.e., age, insulation, heating system) and sources of indoor air pollution such as cigarette Smoking_ASDPTO, use of woodburning stoves, household pets, etc. Analysis of the responses confirmed previous findings of significant relationships between maternal Smoking_ASDPTO (P = .021), and the presence of pets (P = .034) and the occurrence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. A newly reported relationship between exposure to woodburning stoves and the occurrence of Otitis_ASDPTO (P less than .05) was reported. This implicates yet another risk factor (wood burning) in the etiology of Otitis_ASDPTO_media_HP.

Acupuncture for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP? A double-blind crossover study.The therapeutic effectiveness of classic Chinese acupuncture was compared with "placebo" acupuncture in 15 patients with Stable_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The patients received treatments with real and placebo acupuncture in a randomly ordered, subject and evaluator-blind crossover fashion twice weekly for five weeks. Both real and placebo treatment periods were preceded by three week periods when no acupuncture was administered. Five patients felt better on real treatment, five patients preferred placebo and five did not feel any improvement on either of the two treatments. Treatment with real acupuncture when compared with no treatment and placebo treatment failed to provide any improvement in daily peak flow rates, Asthma_ASDPTO_HP symptom scores, number of puffs of beta 2-agonist aerosol use, and pulmonary function results.
Acupuncture for bronchial asthma? A double-blind crossover study.The therapeutic effectiveness of classic Chinese acupuncture was compared with "placebo" acupuncture in 15 patients with stable bronchial asthma. The patients received treatments with real and placebo acupuncture in a randomly ordered, subject and evaluator-blind crossover fashion twice weekly for five weeks. Both real and placebo treatment periods were preceded by three week periods when no acupuncture was administered. Five patients felt better on real treatment, five patients preferred placebo and five did not feel any improvement on either of the two treatments. Treatment with real acupuncture when compared with no treatment and placebo treatment failed to provide any improvement in daily peak flow rates, asthma symptom scores, number of puffs of beta 2-agonist aerosol use, and pulmonary function results.
It's OK having Asthma_ASDPTO_HP ... young children's beliefs about illness.Hospitals and illness can be bewildering and frightening for children. To minimise the distress caused to them, health professionals need to communicate effectively. This involves assessing the child's level of development and the amount of knowledge the child needs.

Adverse health effects among adults exposed to home dampness and molds.To investigate the association between home dampness and mold and health, questionnaires were administered through the primary school system to parents of school-aged children in six regions of Canada. The present report focuses on the symptoms of the 14,799 adults at least 21 yr of age. The overall response rate was 83%, and missing values for individual variables ranged from 3 to 8%. The presence of home dampness and/or molds (that is, damp spots, visible mold or mildew, water damage, and flooding) was reported by 38% of respondents. The prevalence of lower respiratory symptoms (any Cough_HP, phlegm, wheeze, or wheeze with Dyspnea_HP) was increased among those reporting dampness or mold compared with those not reporting dampness or mold as follows: 38 versus 27% among current smokers, 21 versus 14% among exsmokers, and 19 versus 11% among nonsmokers (all p values less than 0.001). This association persisted after adjusting for several sociodemographic variables (including age, sex, and region) and several other exposure variables (including active and passive cigarette smoke, natural gas heating, and wood stoves). The odds ratio between symptoms and dampness was 1.62 (95% confidence interval, 1.48 to 1.78) in the final model chosen. This association persisted despite stratification by the presence of Allergies_ASDPTO or Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Exposure to home dampness and mold may be a risk factor for respiratory disease in the Canadian population.

Is the clinical history a satisfactory means of diagnosing occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP?In some countries a Diagnosis_ASDPTO of occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP for medicolegal purposes is made when a questionnaire is suggestive and the individual is exposed to a product known to be a sensitizer. The value of an open questionnaire administered by physicians with experience in occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is unknown, however. We prospectively assessed all subjects (162) referred to our clinic because their physicians thought their Asthma_ASDPTO_HP might be work related. The medical questionnaire included questions about the nature of the symptoms (Dyspnea_HP, Wheezing_HP, Cough_HP, and Chest_tightness_HP) and the timing (worse at work or after a shift at work or improved during weekends or holidays). An initial clinical assessment was set by the physician on a scale that ranged from highly probable to probable, uncertain, unlikely, or absent. Subjects then underwent objective assessment with specific inhalation challenges (n = 72), serial monitoring of peak expiratory flow rates for periods at work and away from work (n = 29), or both (n = 61), to confirm or rule out the Diagnosis_ASDPTO of occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. A total of 75 subjects (46%) were shown to have occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Symptoms alone (type and timing) did not provide a satisfactory differentiation between those subjects with and those without occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. For example, 66 of 75 (88%) subjects with occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP said that their symptoms improved during holidays, but 66 of 87 (76%) subjects without occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP experienced a similar improvement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Dynamic T-cell changes in Peripheral_HP blood and bronchoalveolar lavage after antigen bronchoprovocation in asthmatics.We previously demonstrated decrease of Peripheral_HP blood CD4+ cells 48 to 72 h after antigen-induced bronchoprovocation in asthmatic subjects. To determine if this was accompanied by reciprocal changes in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, we sampled BAL before and 48 h after antigen administration. Peripheral_HP blood lymphocytes (PBL) and BAL T-cell subset composition were examined in eight extrinsic asthmatics during three different weeks. During control week (CW) BAL was preformed at baseline, and PBL subsets were followed for 3 days. During placebo week (PW) a placebo inhalation was followed by a BAL at 48 h and daily PBL for 3 days. Asthmatic attacks were induced by inhalation of a relevant antigen at the start of antigen week (AW) and followed by examining the BAL at 48 h and PBL daily for 72 h. We found that BAL as a stimulus had no effect on T-cell composition of the PBL after the procedure. After induction of an asthmatic attack there was a reduction of PBL CD4+ cells from a baseline mean of 52.6% to 38.8% at 48 h (p less than 0.05). At the same time BAL CD4+ cells increased from 35.6% at PW to 47.3% in AW (p less than 0.05). These data are compatible with specific recruitment of PBL CD4+ cells into the respiratory system in atopic subjects undergoing antigenic bronchoprovocation.

Cultured Peripheral_HP blood mononuclear cells derived from patients with Status_asthmaticus_HP ("Status_asthmaticus_HP") spontaneously elaborate a neutrophil chemotactic activity distinct from interleukin-8.Peripheral_HP blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from patients with Status_asthmaticus_HP on the day of admission to hospital were cultured in vitro in serum-free medium in the absence of mitogenic stimulants for as long as 72 h. PBMC isolated from control groups (Mild_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, Chronic_HP obstructive airway disease, normal subjects) were cultured in a similar fashion. After incubation, the culture supernatants were tested for neutrophil chemotactic activity (NCA) using a modified Boyden chamber technique. PBMC from patients with Status_asthmaticus_HP elaborated significantly greater amounts of NCA into the culture supernatants as compared with all three control groups (p less than 0.01). The amounts of PBMC-derived NCA from the same patients after 7 days of hospital therapy and clinical improvement were reduced (p less than 0.01). A correlation was observed between the extent of reduction in spontaneous release of NCA by PBMC derived from patients with Status_asthmaticus_HP and the degree of clinical improvement of their Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (p less than 0.02). Both monocytes and lymphocytes, when cultured separately, released NCA in amounts sufficient to account for the total activity released by unfractionated PBMC. NCA in PBMC culture supernatants accumulated progressively with time, a process inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by cycloheximide. The amounts of NCA in culture supernatants did not correlate with the concentrations of histamine in lysates of the PBMC prepared just prior to culture.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Inhaled furosemide prevents both the bronchoconstriction and the increase in neutrophil chemotactic activity induced by ultrasonic "fog" of distilled water in Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics.Inhaled furosemide has been shown to prevent bronchoconstriction induced by inhalation of ultrasonic nebulization of distilled water (UNDW) in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. To evaluate whether inhaled furosemide also prevents the increase in serum neutrophil chemotactic activity (NCA) observed during UNDW bronchoconstriction, we measured NCA during UNDW challenge without (control) and immediately after inhalation of furosemide (40 mg) or placebo (saline) in 10 Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics responsive to UNDW, in a randomized, double-blind study. NCA was assessed by measuring the maximal distance reached by neutrophils in a filter when challenged with the subject serum in a Boyden chamber ("leading front"). UNDW inhalation produced a significant increase in NCA in each subject. Gel filtration chromatography on S400 column indicated that the NCA released were 600 to 700 kD. Saline had no effect on bronchoconstriction nor on NCA increase induced by UNDW in nine patients. Furosemide did not change baseline FEV1, but it prevented bronchoconstriction and NCA increase in nine patients. In the whole group the maximal decrease in FEV1 after UNDW was -31.1%, SEM 4.7 after saline and -7.5%, SEM 5.2 after furosemide, p less than 0.001, the maximal increase in NCA after UNDW was +52.9%, SEM 9.2 after saline and +3.8%, SEM 3.1 after furosemide, p = 0.001. These results indicate that inhaled furosemide prevents both the bronchoconstriction and the NCA increase induced by UNDW inhalation in most Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients. This finding adds support to the suggestion that furosemide acts on mast cells.

Holidays and atopic Eczema_HP.Information was collected by telephone about 300 holidays taken over a three year period by 126 children with Severe_HP atopic Eczema_HP. During the holidays, improvement in Eczema_HP occurred more frequently (112/300, 37%) than deterioration (63/300, 21%). There was a significant correlation between improvement and a more southerly holiday location: improvement was common in holidays taken in the Mediterranean or further south (63/92, 69%), but holidays in northern Britain were more likely to be associated with deterioration (27/100, 27%) than improvement (13/100, 13%). Changes in Eczema_HP were correlated with changes in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in 231 holidays taken by children with both conditions, but improvement was not significantly associated with pet ownership. All patients returned to their preholiday state, usually within two weeks of return home. The causes of changes in Eczema_HP while on holiday have not been identified.

Hydration in Severe_HP Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Twenty children were studied during Severe_HP attacks of Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP to find out how dehydrated they were on admission to hospital. Mean body weight on admission was 97.8% of their reference Stable_HP weight seven to 10 days after the attack and in only three children was it less than 95% of the Stable_HP weight. Bedside assessment of Dehydration_HP was unreliable. The mean packed cell volume was significantly higher on admission than 7-10 days later (0.44 compared with 0.42, difference 0.02 SE 0.01). Serum sodium and potassium concentrations and osmolality on admission were within normal ranges. The degree of Dehydration_HP correlated best with a fall in blood pH. There was no association between the degree of Dehydration_HP and the recovery of the peak expiratory flow rate during the first 24 hours or thereafter. We conclude that Mild_HP Dehydration_HP is common in Severe_HP Acute_HP childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Fluid given at a rate of 50 ml/kg/24 hours was safe and appropriate for these children.

[Experience with in vitro rapid diagnostic methods (DHS-CLA) in childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].The authors examined the value of the chemoluminescent assay (CLA) in 35 Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic children. Each serum sample was examined concerning its reaction with 35 allergen extracts and the appropriate IgE value was also determined. The allergen-panel was adapted to the Hungarian prevalence. Results were read within 24 hours. Skin prick test and in vitro CLA results were in agreement in 89% of measurement. Purified, major antigens (grass, mite) gave a specially good concordance. Good agreement was also found in highly sensitized patients and children in the age below 3 years; in such cases RAST and CLA values were compared. In discordant cases revision of anamnesis supported the positive CLA result, however in some (5) negative CLA test this could not be strengthened. Chemoluminescent assay was shown to be fast, reliable and risk-free method, but high costs still limit its general use.

Analysis of expiratory pattern for monitoring bronchial obstruction in school-age children.This study was designed to assess the validity of the percent of volume expired at tidal peak flow (dV/Vt) as an indicator of bronchial obstruction in school-age children. We analyzed 126 dV/Vt ratios and compared them with spirometric and plethysmographic results measured in 24 Healthy_HP (14 males) and 60 asthmatic (41 males) children; 42 of them underwent measurements before and after bronchial challenge with histamine. The two groups differed in resistance, forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1), and forced expiratory flows, as percents of predicted (FEV1: 94.6 +/- 2.4% in controls vs 86.7 +/- 1.6% in asthmatics; P less than 0.001). They did not differ in peak expiratory flow (PEF), forced vital capacity, functional residual capacity, measured by body plethysmography, and in dV/Vt. The dV/Vt was found to correlate with FEV1 (r = 0.58, P less than 0.001), PEF (r = 0.57, P less than 0.001), and other lung function parameters. Forty-two of the asthmatic children performed a bronchoprovocation histamine test. The fall of dV/Vt after histamine was significantly correlated (r = 0.61, P less than 0.001) with the variation in FEV1 and other lung function parameters. We conclude that dV/Vt is a good indicator of bronchial obstruction, as useful in school-age children as in adults and infants, with no need for the subject's cooperation.

The sensation of pulmonary Dyspnea_HP in school-age children.The purpose of this investigation was to describe the sensation of Dyspnea_HP in a sample of 39 school-age children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and to identify strategies used to cope with the symptom. In addition, three methods to measure Dyspnea_HP Severity_HP in children were tested and compared. Breathing on a "bad breathing day" was used as a proxy variable to represent Dyspnea_HP. The most Frequent_HP description of how breathing feels on a bad day was "it is hard to breathe." Words chosen most Frequent_HPly from a checklist of sensations were "wheezy," "Respiratory_distress_HP," "tight," and physical sensations such as "Vomiting_HP," "hurting," and "stuffiness." The children's feelings on a bad breathing day were categorized as negative moods or emotions, a wish for change, or physical symptoms. Ratings of breathing on "good", "bad," and "usual breathing" days on word descriptor, visual analogue, and color scales provided evidence of concurrent validity for the three measures of Dyspnea_HP Severity_HP. The most Frequent_HP strategies used to cope with Dyspnea_HP were Medications_ASDPTO, change in Position_HP, decreased activity, fluids, relaxation, distraction, and social support. The findings were very similar to those previously described for an adult sample.

In addition, three methods to measure dyspnea intensity in children were tested and compared. Breathing on a "bad breathing day" was used as a proxy variable to represent dyspnea. The most frequent description of how breathing feels on a bad day was "it is hard to breathe." Words chosen most frequently from a checklist of sensations were "wheezy," "short of breath," "tight," and physical sensations such as "throwing up," "hurting," and "stuffiness." The children's feelings on a bad breathing day were categorized as negative moods or emotions, a wish for change, or physical symptoms. Ratings of breathing on "good", "bad," and "usual breathing" days on word descriptor, visual analogue, and color scales provided evidence of concurrent validity for the three measures of dyspnea intensity. The most frequent strategies used to cope with dyspnea were medications, change in position, decreased activity, fluids, relaxation, distraction, and social support. The findings were very similar to those previously described for an adult sample.
Neural control of airway vasculature and Edema_HP.The tracheobronchial vasculature is controlled by adrenergic, cholinergic, and peptidergic nervous mechanisms. Sympathetic nerves release norepinephrine and neuropeptide Y (NPY), which are both constrictor agents, the latter being long-lasting. Parasympathetic nerves release acetylcholine and usually vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), both of which are vasodilators, VIP being the longer lasting. These motor nerves are controlled by many reflex inputs. Activation of pulmonary C-fiber receptors by irritants and inflammatory mediators causes a powerful vasodilatation, mainly via sympathetic motor nerves. Cardiac and chemoreceptor reflexes also influence airway vascular tone. Sensory nerves in the airway mucosa are responsible for local axon reflexes in response to irritants and inflammatory mediators. These nerves contain neuropeptides such as substance P (SP), neurokinins A and B (NKA, NKB), and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). All these neuropeptides are powerful vasodilators. Thus, inflammatory conditions in the lungs such as Asthma_ASDPTO_HP cause vasodilation by local direct action of mediators, by axon reflexes, and by Central_HP nervous reflexes. The vasodilation could lead to mucosal Edema_HP. Thus, airway vascular responses have to be added to bronchoconstriction and mucus secretion as part of the mucosal pathology of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Parasympathetic nerves release acetylcholine and usually vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), both of which are vasodilators, VIP being the longer lasting. These motor nerves are controlled by many reflex inputs. Activation of pulmonary C-fiber receptors by irritants and inflammatory mediators causes a powerful vasodilatation, mainly via sympathetic motor nerves. Cardiac and chemoreceptor reflexes also influence airway vascular tone. Sensory nerves in the airway mucosa are responsible for local axon reflexes in response to irritants and inflammatory mediators. These nerves contain neuropeptides such as substance P (SP), neurokinins A and B (NKA, NKB), and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). All these neuropeptides are powerful vasodilators. Thus, inflammatory conditions in the lungs such as asthma cause vasodilation by local direct action of mediators, by axon reflexes, and by central nervous reflexes. The vasodilation could lead to mucosal edema. Thus, airway vascular responses have to be added to bronchoconstriction and mucus secretion as part of the mucosal pathology of asthma.
Modulation of neurogenic inflammation by neutral endopeptidase.The enzyme neutral endopeptidase (NEP) is bound to the membranes of selected cells in the airways that have receptors for tachykinins. The location of the enzyme, along with its selectivity of substrates (tachykinins are a preferred substrate), allows the enzyme to cleave tachykinins that come close to the cell-surface receptors. By cleaving and thus inactivating tachykinins released during stimulation of the sensory nerves, NEP limits the degree of neurogenic inflammation. Neutral endopeptidase exists in the basal cells of the airway epithelium, nerves, smooth muscle, glands, blood vessels, and perhaps other cells. Thus, the enzyme modulates smooth muscle contraction, gland secretion, Cough_HP, vascular permeability, and neutrophil adhesion. Decreased NEP activity occurs with epithelial removal, during respiratory viral infections, and during exposure to irritants (e.g., cigarette smoke and toluene diisocyanate). Delivery of recombinant NEP (rNEP) by aerosol suppressed Cough_HP responses during neurogenic inflammation. We suggest that decreased NEP activity will result in exaggerated neurogenic inflammation and may play an important role in inflammatory diseases in airways. Furthermore, drugs that cause up-regulation of NEP may play a therapeutic role by suppressing neurogenic responses. Replacement therapy with rNEP may be useful in diseases where inflammatory peptides (e.g., tachykinins, bradykinin) play a role in pathogenesis.

PAF antagonism as an approach to the treatment of airway hyperreactivity.Platelet-activating factor (PAF) would seem a good candidate for a mediator of airway hyperreactivity. It has been reported to induce a long-lasting, if modest, increase in hyperreactivity in both experimental animals and humans. Evidence (albeit often indirect) suggests increased levels associated with bronchial hyperreactivity or the related "late-phase reaction" of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. In experimental animals, specific inhibitors of PAF can suppress both allergen and PAF-induced hyperreactivity as well as the late-phase reaction to allergen. The mechanism by which PAF induces hyperreactivity is unknown, but the potent effects of PAF on the eosinophil, a cell characteristic of the inflammatory processes often associated with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and hyperreactivity, may be important. A number of potent and selective PAF antagonists are now available. The crucial test for the hypothesis that PAF has a role in human airway hyperreactivity will be the testing of substances such as these in appropriate double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.

Rehabilitation of a patient with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in the outpatient setting.Although traditional rehabilitation medicine approaches are necessary in patients with the most Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, principles of rehabilitation described in this article are useful for almost all patients. These principles are perhaps most useful early in a patient's course when the setting of appropriate expectations is important in minimizing restrictions from both disease and its treatment. Once a patient has developed restrictions, prompt institution of rehabilitation is essential to prevent significant disability, which can be avoided or even reversed. Once rehabilitation has been instituted, progress with rehabilitation goals should be monitored in visits to the physician so that communication with the appropriate health care professional can be established to readjust therapy. Physician interest in the process of rehabilitation can stimulate motivation of the patient.

Eosinophil cationic protein stimulates and major basic protein inhibits airway mucus secretion.Possible roles of eosinophil (EO) products in modulating the release of mucus from airway explants were investigated. Cell- and membrane-free lysates from purified human EOs (1 to 20 x 10(5)) caused a dose-dependent release of respiratory glycoconjugates (RGC) from cultured feline tracheal explants. Crude extracts from isolated EO granules also stimulated RGC release, suggesting that a granular protein might be responsible. Three proteins derived from EO granules, EO-derived neurotoxin, EO cationic protein (ECP), and major basic protein (MBP) were separated by sequential sizing and affinity chromatography. ECP (0.025 to 25 micrograms/ml) caused a dose-dependent increase in RGC release from both feline and human airway explants and also stimulated the release of the serous cell-marker, lactoferrin, from human bronchial explants. EO-derived neurotoxin (0.025 to 50 micrograms/ml) failed to Affect_ASDPTO RGC release, whereas MBP (50 micrograms/ml) significantly inhibited RGC release from feline explants. Thus, ECP stimulates RGC and lactoferrin release from airway explants, whereas MBP inhibits RGC release.

The effect of dapsone in steroid-dependent Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.We studied the steroid-sparing effect of dapsone in 10 subjects with Chronic_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in a preliminary open trial. Dapsone was chosen because it inhibits neutrophil function and possesses anti-inflammatory effects in a variety of disorders. The study group consisted of 10 subjects with Stable_HP, steroid-dependent Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, aged 23 to 80 years, with normal glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase levels. Average daily baseline prednisone dose ranged from 5 to 60 mg. Dapsone, 100 mg, twice daily, by mouth, was started after a 1-month baseline period. Baseline steroid dose, symptom scores, and daily peak flow rates were compared to the latest available 4-week period of dapsone treatment. Average cumulative monthly prednisone dose was reduced from 428 mg to 82 mg (p less than 0.02). Five of 10 patients stopped steroids by month 6 and two additional patients by month 13. Two additional patients demonstrated a coincidental 74% reduction in steroid dose, and one patient demonstrated no response. Clinical parameters remained Stable_HP despite steroid reduction. These preliminary data suggest dapsone may have steroid-sparing effects in Chronic_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Local immunotherapy with Dermatophagoides extract in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Local immunotherapy (LIT) with Dermatophagoides extract or placebo were administered to two groups of 11 patients with allergic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in a double-blind fashion. All patients received cromolyn sodium (20 mg four times a day) during treatments. Bronchial provocation tests with allergen and methacholine were performed before, 1 week, and 4 weeks after the end of treatments. Symptom score, drug consumption, and peak expiratory flow were monitored daily from 2 weeks before to 4 weeks after treatments. Compared to baseline, early bronchial sensitivity to allergen was significantly reduced both 1 week (p less than 0.0005) and 4 weeks (p less than 0.01) after LIT but not after placebo administration. Late bronchial reaction to allergen occurred similarly after placebo administration and LIT. However, in the group with LIT, the Severity_HP of late reaction was unchanged after treatment in spite of the significantly larger doses of allergen administered to provoke the early asthmatic reaction. Neither symptom score, nor drug consumption, nor peak expiratory flow were significantly different in the two groups before and during the treatment period even though both symptom score and drug consumption tended to be reduced after LIT. We conclude that LIT may be an effective and safe alternative to traditional immunotherapy.

Methacholine challenges in the management of young children.Methacholine bronchial challenges (MBCs) have been used as an important diagnostic and management tool for physicians who treat children with Chronic_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Despite this, children less than 5 years of age present significant diagnostic and management questions that can not easily be answered because of their inability to perform standard spirometry, and thus methacholine bronchial challenges. The present study was designed to evaluate with methacholine bronchial challenge small children (between 2 and 6 years of age) with the Diagnosis_ASDPTO of or a suspected Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, utilizing a new method of evaluating airflow in small children through sound analysis, Computer Digitized Airway Phonopneumography (CDAP). There were 23 children in the study between the ages of 2 and 6 years with suspected Asthma_ASDPTO_HP who could not perform pulmonary function tests. A control group consisting of 12 subjects between the ages of 8 and 38 years of age with a history of Chronic_HP Cough_HP and/or Wheezing_HP who could perform pulmonary function tests was also studied. Of the 12 patients over the age of 8 who had MBC, 11 of them had positive challenges with a fall in FEV1 of 19% or greater. The percent change in sound Severity_HP levels from baseline range from 232% to 396% of baseline. There was greater than 200% change in mean Severity_HP levels with a concentration of methacholine that produced a 19% fall in FEV1 in all of the eleven patients. For one individual who had a negative MBC there was only a 16% change in pulmonary function at 25 mg of methacholine with essentially no change in sound Severity_HP level from baseline.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Chronotherapy of reversible airways disease with once-daily evening doses of a controlled-release theophylline preparation.1. Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP worsen at night and in the early morning, due to various circadian influences. 2. Uninterrupted sleep, Stable_HP lung function over 24 h, and reduced and Stable_HP airways responsiveness are primary therapeutic goals in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP. 3. Once-daily evening theophylline chronotherapy meets these goals, providing rising blood levels at night and in the early morning, when most needed. 4. This regimen is now indicated for morning and evening dosing for reversible airway obstruction, in the United States and Canada, and marks the first available treatment for these diseases to include dosing time in the therapeutic strategy. It reflects increasing recognition by the medical community of the need to consider the individual patient's timing of symptoms in relation to the kinetics of the drug. 5. Theophylline chronotherapy is as well tolerated as more frequently administered methylxanthine preparations despite the relatively large single doses required by the Prolonged_HP dosing interval. The convenience of once-daily administration favors drug-taking compliance. 6. Theophylline chronotherapy does not provide constant blood levels over the 24-h day. Indeed, by improving lung function by means of a larger peak-to-trough difference than associated with twice-daily theophylline, once-daily chronotherapy has altered our thinking about theophylline pharmacodynamics.

[Vocal_cord_dysfunction_HP mimicking Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].A 19-year-old woman presented with attacks of Dyspnea_HP, Wheezing_HP and Stridor_HP. She had been treated for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP with bronchodilators and corticosteroids without improvement. During episodes of Wheezing_HP, lung function tests were consistent with variable extrathoracic obstruction. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy confirmed that Wheezing_HP was due to paradoxical adduction of the vocal cords during the respiratory cycle. Clinical symptoms improved with speech therapy and psychological aid in relaxation. Vocal_cord_dysfunction_HP is important in the differential Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Bronchial responsiveness during regular fenoterol therapy: four months prospective study.Effects of a regimen of regular high dose beta agonist aerosol as sole therapy (fenoterol 400 micrograms qid) on FEV1 and bronchial responsiveness to methacholine provocation were examined monthly in 16 atopic moderately Severe_HP asthmatic subjects in an open uncontrolled four months study. Eleven completed the trial, four dropped out on account of Severe_HP Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and one with muscle Tremor_HP. Overall there was a small significant drop of mean prebronchodilator FEV1 after one month of 0.27 L (95% confidence interval 0.12, 0.42) but not significant thereafter. The increase of bronchial responsiveness (mean decrease of PD20 of 0.50 doubling doses of methacholine) by the end of month four did not reach statistical significance. Our study which explored potentially adverse effects of this beta agonist regimen showed only small changes of doubtful clinical significance. Drop outs due to Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP complicate studies such as this and make conclusions difficult.

Multidisciplinary co-operation in primary care for asthmatic children.In the development of 'education protocols' for the treatment and education about Chronic_HP diseases in primary care the involvement of several disciplines of careproviders must often be taken into account. This implies that tasks will have to be divided across several disciplines. An orderly way to do this does not seem to have been suggested in the literature. In this paper a systematic technique is presented to divide educational tasks across disciplines. The basic idea of this method is that one should link up as far as possible with existing task conceptions and knowledge of the disciplines involved. The general description of the technique will be followed by a piece of research in which the technique is applied to protocol development for parents of asthmatic children (0-4 years). The protocol aims at allocating specific Asthma_ASDPTO_HP education tasks to community nurses, general practitioners, Asthma_ASDPTO_HP nurses and doctors working at child health centers in the Netherlands. This paper focuses mainly on results for community nurses. Three criteria were considered in assigning tasks to the different careproviders: whether the discipline in question claimed a certain task; whether the other three disciplines agreed with the claim, and whether the discipline in question had appropriate and sufficient knowledge about Asthma_ASDPTO_HP to perform the task correctly. Community nurses did claim several tasks in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP care, but knowledge did not always seem to be sufficient. Additional results indicated that nurses who had taken a refresher course did have a higher knowledge level than nurses who had not taken such a course. Regular contact with asthmatic children also tended to be associated with increased knowledge of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Surveillance for occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Medical surveillance programs can be established either for identification of workers potentially at risk for developing occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP or for early detection of occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP so that appropriate interventions can be made to prevent further cases. The author describes several tests used for the early detection of occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. These include respiratory and allergic symptom questionnaires, cross-shift spirometry, serial measurement of peak expiratory flow rates and/or serial methacholine challenge, and serial skin or serum testing for specific sensitization. Available data suggest that medical surveillance programs for early case detection and removal of Affected_HP workers from further exposure can be effective in preventing persistent Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Corticosteroids for Acute_HP, Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Corticosteroids have been used in the therapy of Acute_HP, Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP since the early 1950s. Numerous randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults and children have proven corticosteroids to be efficacious. Only the results from less rigorously designed trials have failed to show a beneficial effect. The Onset_HP of response, dose, and mode of administration have been relatively well defined; however, other aspects (i.e., duration of therapy, need to taper the dose, and risks of multiple short bursts) require further study. Early institution of corticosteroids in well-defined patient populations will decrease the need for Hospitalizations_ASDPTO. However, administration of corticosteroids to every patient presenting to the clinician's office or emergency room prior to aggressive bronchodilator therapy is unwarranted. All patients demonstrating an incomplete response or the inability to maintain a complete response following one to two hours of aggressive bronchodilator therapy should receive a course of corticosteroids. Courses as short as three to five days have proven efficacy in outpatients, whereas hospitalized patients usually are treated for seven to ten days. The duration of therapy depends on the individual rate of response.

Lung function and bronchial reactivity in Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics during exposure to volatile organic compounds.The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether vapors of organic solvents at low concentrations could exert an adverse effect in the lower airways. Under controlled conditions in a climate chamber, 11 persons with bronchial hyperreactivity to histamine and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were exposed for 90 min to a mixture of organic solvents at levels of zero, 2.5, and 25 mg/m3. During exposure to 25 mg/m3 a decrease in FEV1 to 90.7% of baseline value was measured. This was significantly different from the initial value (p less than 0.05), but not significantly different from the value found after sham exposure (FEV1, 97.4% of initial value). The decline in FEV1 during exposure to 25 mg/m3 was most pronounced in persons with high bronchial sensitivity. No changes were found in histamine reactivity after exposure, and no late reactions were registered. Ratings of discomfort showed different individual patterns ranging from no response to reactions towards both of the concentrations. The ratings indicated development of tolerance during exposure. Volatile organic compounds in concentrations found in both the work and the home environments may influence lung function and are probably of importance as bronchial irritants.

Ratings of discomfort showed different individual patterns ranging from no response to reactions towards both of the concentrations. The ratings indicated development of tolerance during exposure. Volatile organic compounds in concentrations found in both the work and the home environments may influence lung function and are probably of importance as bronchial irritants.
The safety aspects of fiberoptic bronchoscopy, bronchoalveolar lavage, and endobronchial biopsy in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.We have documented the physiologic effects of fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and endobronchial biopsy performed under local anesthesia in 20 asthmatic subjects, 8 Healthy_HP nonatopic control subjects, and 8 atopic nonasthmatic subjects. Premedication consisted of nebulized albuterol (2.5 mg; except for the study of atopic nonasthmatic subjects), ipratropium bromide (500 micrograms), and intramuscular atropine (0.6 mg). Intravenous midazolam was given for Mild_HP sedation, and oxygen was delivered via a nasal cannula. FEV1 was measured before and after premedication, immediately postbronchoscopy, and after 2 h recovery. There was a significant fall in mean (+/- SD) FEV1 immediately postbronchoscopy in both the asthmatic (26.2 +/- 16.7%; p less than 0.001) and normal (9 +/- 4.7%, p less than 0.05) groups, which in the asthmatic subjects correlated inversely with the concentration of methacholine provoking a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20) measured 5 days prebronchoscopy (r = -0.74, p less than 0.001) but not with symptom scores, albuterol use, or peak expiratory flow (PEF) variation recorded during 2 wk before the investigation. There was significant arterial hemoglobin O2 desaturation during biopsy in the asthmatic subjects (median 3%, range -1 to 17% fall from baseline; p less than 0.01), which was not related to any of the measured indices of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Severity_HP. PC20, measured 5 days before and 5 days after bronchoscopy in the asthmatic subjects and 2 days before and 1 day after bronchoscopy in the atopic nonasthmatic subjects was not significantly Affected_HP by the procedure. We conclude that fiberoptic bronchoscopy with BAL and endobronchial biopsy can be conducted safely in asthmatic subjects, but requires caution in those with very responsive airways.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Effects of PAF antagonist, BN52021, on the PAF-, methacholine-, and allergen-induced bronchoconstriction in Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic children.Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is an inflammatory mediator capable of inducing protracted inflammation of the airways and bronchial hyperreactivity. Twenty-one Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic children were evenly divided into three groups and each group performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled and crossover study on the effect of aerosolized BN52021, a PAF antagonist, on the bronchoconstriction induced by PAF, methacholine, or specific allergen, respectively. One group of Healthy_HP children was included for comparison. Total WBC, neutrophils, and eosinophils were counted before and after PAF challenge. The results showed the following: (1) six of seven Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics and one of seven normal subjects gave a positive bronchial provocation with PAF; (2) in Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics, prior inhalation of BN52021 could inhibit the bronchoconstriction induced by PAF (6/6) and allergen (3/7), but not by methacholine; and (3) 5 min after inhalation of PAF, there was a marked decrease of Peripheral_HP blood eosinophils and neutrophils that could be inhibited by prior inhalation of BN52021 in normal subjects but not in Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics. These findings support the idea that PAF may be involved in the pathogenesis of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and PAF antagonist may have a role in the prevention and treatment of this disease.

[Anguilluliasis hyperinfection in a patient receiving corticosteroids: hepatic and biliary involvement].A case of strongyloidiasis hyperinfection is reported in a 59 year-old man who presented cortico-dependent Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Several points of this case are uncommon: the long latency period (40 years), simultaneous aggravation of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP requiring increasing doses of corticosteroids, and above all, liver and biliary tract involvement. Disseminated strongyloidiasis is widely believed to be precipitated by impairment of cell-mediated immunity. It is therefore unlikely that infestation of the liver and the biliary tract can interfere with hepatic function.

Theophylline in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP: changing perspectives and controversies.Theophylline's role in the treatment of airway obstruction has been challenged, yet it remains a useful agent in the management of Obstructive_lung_disease_HP. It has a narrow therapeutic range and Frequent_HP side effects. Drug interactions are common, and variations in theophylline clearance among patients arise from individual differences in its absorption, metabolism, and elimination. Acute_HP Bronchospasm_HP is best treated with inhaled sympathomimetic agents, but the nonbronchodilator effects of theophylline offer therapeutic benefits for the patient with non-reversible disease. When properly monitored by serum level determinations, theophylline may be used as an adjunct to aerosol therapy and corticosteroids in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. However, the patient with Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP may benefit the most from an empiric trial of the drug, using lower doses than were commonly employed in the past.

Treatment of Status_asthmaticus_HP with intravenous magnesium sulfate.The bronchodilating effect of magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) was studied in two patients with Status_asthmaticus_HP, who were intubated and mechanically ventilated by a respirator. Airway resistance was continuously monitored by the respiration-controlled interruption technique. After administration of 0.5 mmol/min MgSO4 intravenously, airway resistance decreased from 17 to 9, and from 13 to 8 mmHg/L/s in the two patients, respectively, and piping Crackles_HP diminished or disappeared. We conclude that while corticosteroid therapy requires several hours to demonstrate significant effects in Status_asthmaticus_HP, MgSO4 is of great benefit in the rapid improvement of airflow obstruction.

A bronchial response comparison of exercise and methacholine in asthmatic subjects.The authors compared the inhaled methacholine and exercise responses in 22 Stable_HP unmedicated asthmatic patients. The exercise and methacholine challenges were performed at one to three week intervals. Bronchial responsiveness to methacholine was measured in relation to the concentration of methacholine (PC20M). The response to exercise was expressed as the percentage of fall in FEV1 from the pre-exercise FEV1. The findings showed that 21 of 22 subjects demonstrated a fall in FEV1 of more than 20% after methacholine challenge, while only 9/22 subjects experienced a similar decrease in FEV1. All 9 of these positive response exercise cases completed three consecutive exercise challenges prior to the methacholine challenge. Of these cases, five were Refractory_HP to the repeated exercise challenge, and the PD20M at the nonexercise stage was significantly lower than the postexercise state. In fact, the methacholine challenge sensitivity actually decreased (PD20 increased) after repeated exercise. The authors concluded that methacholine seems to be a more sensitive bronchial provocation test than exercise. Second, only 55.6% of the exercise test-positive subjects were Refractory_HP to the second exercise challenge. Therefore, other factors besides the release of mediators should be considered in Exercise-induced_Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Third, methacholine sensitivity actually decreased (PD20 increases) after repeat exercise challenge.

Predicting Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in individual patients.The degree to which Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attacks were related to seven environmental variables was determined for each of 17 individuals. Using stepwise regression procedures, cladosporium mold, ragweed pollen, and a change in temperature were significant predictors of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attacks in 5 of 17 individuals. The information provided by these analyses could prove useful in helping some individuals manage their Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Human eosinophil major basic protein induces airway constriction and airway hyperresponsiveness in primates.We have examined the effects of direct intratracheal instillation of purified eosinophil granule proteins on pulmonary function and airway responsiveness in primates. The results of this study show for the first time that installation of major basic protein (MBP) directly into the trachea of primates results in a significant and dose-related increase in airway responsiveness to inhaled methacholine. Furthermore, MBP and eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) induce a Transient_HP bronchoconstriction immediately after instillation that resolves by 1 h postinstillation. In contrast, instillation of other eosinophil granule proteins had no effect on airway responsiveness or pulmonary function. These data indicate a direct role of the eosinophil in the pathogenesis of airway hyperresponsiveness. We suggest that the MBP of human eosinophils has an effector role in the pathogenesis of airway hyperresponsiveness which may involve active interaction with resident airway tissue cells. MBP may also mediate altered lung function in various inflammatory lung diseases associated with Pulmonary_eosinophilic_infiltration_HP.

Analysis of factors associated with bronchial hyperreactivity to methacholine in Bronchiectasis_HP.Nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR) has been reported to occur in patients with Bronchiectasis_HP. To evaluate this further, we studied 77 patients with Stable_HP Bronchiectasis_HP (noncystic fibrosis) with special reference to the prevalence of BHR to methacholine (MCh), and its relation to lung function, sputum characteristics, concommitant Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, and atopy. The concentration of MCh required to produce a fall of 20% in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), PC20, was determined by Wright's nebulization tidal breathing method. BHR defined by a PC20 greater than or equal to 8 mg/ml was found in 21 of 47 (45%) subjects who underwent bronchial challenge. Presence of BHR was positively associated with low baseline spirometric values, Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, long duration of disease, and elevated total IgE on univariant analysis, and was significantly related to FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP on multiple regression analysis. Ten of the 21 hyperreactive subjects did not have clinical Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, whereas all 11 of 22 subjects with clinical Asthma_ASDPTO_HP who underwent bronchial challenge were hyperreactive. Among those with BHR, there was a positive correlation between PC20 and baseline FEV1. When patients were further classified into asthmatic and nonasthmatic subjects, a positive correlation between PC20 and FEV1 was seen only in those without Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Frequency_HP of infective episodes and inflammatory score of sputum assessed by average daily volume, purulence, and leukocyte count did not differ significantly in the groups with and without BHR. These results suggest that BHR in patients with Bronchiectasis_HP is associated with coexistent Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and worse spriometric values, and not with the Severity_HP of bronchial Sepsis_HP.

The influence of a Family_history_HP of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and parental Smoking_ASDPTO on airway responsiveness in early infancy.Airway responsiveness to inhaled nonspecific bronchoconstrictive agents has been demonstrated in normal, Healthy_HP infants. However, it is unknown whether airway responsiveness is present from birth or if it develops as a result of subsequent insults to the respiratory tract. To investigate this question, we assessed airway responsiveness in 63 normal infants at a mean age of 4 1/2 weeks.

Clinical-physiologic correlations in Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP of childhood.Seventy-one patients who presented to the emergency room with Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were evaluated to determine the relationship between common clinical signs and spirometric and transcutaneous arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) measurements. Prior to treatment, a physical examination was performed, a clinical score assigned, and pulmonary function and SaO2 were measured. Although forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and SaO2 had strong correlation with the overall clinical score (r2 = .47, .49 respectively), many patients with low clinical scores and apparent Mild_HP clinical disease had low FEV1 values (as low as 20% predicted). Of the individual components of the clinical score (ie, heart rate, respiratory rate, pulsus paradoxus, accessory muscle use, Dyspnea_HP, and Wheezing_HP), the degree of accessory muscle use correlated most closely with lung function followed by the degree of Dyspnea_HP and Wheezing_HP. Similarly, the degree of accessory muscle use correlated most closely with SaO2 followed by Dyspnea_HP and respiratory rate. Significant correlation (r2 = .59) was found between SaO2 and FEV1, although the range of SaO2 value for a given FEV1 was wide and some patients with low FEV1 values had normal SaO2 values. These results show that although clinically apparent Severe_HP disease and Hypoxemia_HP were always associated with low FEV1, their absence does not exclude the presence of airflow obstruction. It is concluded that for the optimal evaluation of Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in children in the emergency room, clinical evaluation should be used in conjunction with objective laboratory measurements.

[A case report of Eosinophilic_bladder_infiltration_HP complicated with Transient_HP Vesicoureteral_reflux_HP].A case of Eosinophilic_bladder_infiltration_HP complicated with Transient_HP Vesicoureteral_reflux_HP in an 11-year-old girl with allergic disorders is reported. She was suffering from Pollakisuria_HP, painful urination, vesical Irritability_HP, and Macroscopic_Hematuria_HP for about 2 months. Urinalysis showed aseptic Pyuria_HP. White blood cell count was 9,700/mm3 with eosinophils of 10%. Eosinophils were also found on urine cytology. Intravenous pyelography revealed Bilateral_HP Hydronephrosis_HP and apparently contracted bladder. Tumorous lesion and edematous mucosa were observed in the retrotrigonal region on cystoscopy. The multiple bladder biopsy uniformly revealed Eosinophilic_bladder_infiltration_HP. Following antiallergic treatment, practically all symptoms subsided in steps, and normal cystoscopic appearance and histological structure were restored in 3 months. The Vesicoureteral_reflux_HP markedly diminished in 10 months.

Long-term effects of biofeedback-induced facial relaxation on measures of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Severity_HP in children.We studied the effects of electromyographic biofeedback on measures of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Severity_HP in children. Fifteen children received biofeedback training to reduce facial tension, and 14 children, who served as controls, received biofeedback training to maintain facial tension at a Stable_HP level. Assignment to experimental condition was random. As a result of training, electromyographic levels decreased in children trained in facial relaxation and remained fairly constant in children trained in facial tension stability. Biofeedback training was augmented for children in both groups by having them practice their facial exercises at home. Each child's condition was followed for a five-month period subsequent to biofeedback training. Throughout the experiment, the following measures of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Severity_HP were monitored: lung function, self-rated Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Severity_HP, medication usage, and Frequency_HP of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attacks. In addition, standardized measures of attitudes toward Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, self-concept, and Chronic_HP Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP were recorded at regular intervals. As compared to the facial stability subjects, the facial relaxation subjects exhibited higher pulmonary scores, more positive attitudes toward Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, and lower Chronic_HP Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP during the follow-up period. Subjects in the two groups, however, did not differ on self-rated Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Severity_HP, medication usage, Frequency_HP of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attacks, or self-concept. Based on the improvements we observed in pulmonary, attitude, and Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP measures, we concluded that biofeedback training for facial relaxation contributes to the self-control of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and would be a valuable addition to Asthma_ASDPTO_HP self-management programs.

Based on the improvements we observed in pulmonary, attitude, and anxiety measures, we concluded that biofeedback training for facial relaxation contributes to the self-control of asthma and would be a valuable addition to asthma self-management programs.
Isoproterenol infusion in the management of Respiratory_failure_HP in children with Status_asthmaticus_HP: experience in a small community hospital and review of the literature.Between January 1985 and December 1988, a total of 701 children were admitted to The Methodist Hospital, Brooklyn, NY for treatment of Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Eleven of these patients (age range between 8 months and 15 years) went into Respiratory_failure_HP. All cases of Respiratory_failure_HP were successfully treated with intravenous isoproterenol. Only one patient needed mechanical ventilation. Treatment with isoproterenol was safe and effective without any complications. We present our experience in the use of isoproterenol in treating children with Respiratory_failure_HP secondary to Status_asthmaticus_HP. A brief review of the literature is included.

Evaluation of a new Asthma_ASDPTO_HP questionnaire.The new International Union Against Tuberculosis (IUAT) bronchial symptoms questionnaire was completed by 827 subjects participating in a prospective study of respiratory symptoms and lung function in aluminum smelter workers. A modified Medical Research Council (MRC) questionnaire was also administered. Bronchial reactivity (BR) was measured in 809 subjects by methacholine challenge using a rapid method. Factor analysis demonstrated sensible clustering of responses to items unique to the new questionnaire such as Nocturnal_HP, spontaneous, and postexertional Dyspnea_HP, dust-induced Dyspnea_HP and tightness, and Breathing_dysregulation_HP. Responses to IUAT questions concerning past Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, wheeze, Chest_tightness_HP, morning Cough_HP and sputum, and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP medication agreed well with corresponding items from the MRC questionnaire. Questions concerning Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, medication, dust-induced, Nocturnal_HP, and spontaneous Dyspnea_HP, Chest_tightness_HP, wheeze, Nocturnal_HP Cough_HP, postexertional Dyspnea_HP and Breathing_dysregulation_HP also had high validity against the criterion of concurrently measured bronchial reactivity. It is concluded that the IUAT questionnaire is a valid Asthma_ASDPTO_HP questionnaire.

There was considerable family stress Aggravated_by_HP Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP about the patient's illness. Parents were told that the condition was different from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and probably functional in origin. There have been no further episodes, possibly due to counseling and education in relaxation techniques as well as oral pharmacotherapy for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP with avoidance of inhaled Medications_ASDPTO.
Vocal cord dysfunction in a child with asthma.Vocal cord dysfunction is uncommon in children. We present the case of a 12-year-old boy with a history of mild, intermittent asthma from 7 to 10 years of age. Subsequently, severe, rapid-onset attacks of respiratory distress occurred with increasing frequency. After a life-threatening attack of airway obstruction with 3 minutes of apnea, he was hospitalized for diagnostic studies. Although pulmonary function tests were normal, laryngoscopy under general anesthesia revealed extremely severe vocal cord spasm induced by minimal contact of the laryngoscope.

Parental perceptions of childhood illness.This article takes parental perception as the starting point of an analysis of the relationship between ill children, their families, and their doctors in the handling of a child's illness. A modified version of Creer, Marion, and Creer's Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Problem Behavior Checklist, adapted to suit Italian conditions, was used. The questionnaire was given to a sample of 460 parents of 230 preadolescent children. The sample was divided into two groups: The first sample was comprised of 84 parents of 42 preadolescent children with atopic symptoms (Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, Bronchitis_HP, or Allergic_rhinitis_HP), and the second sample was comprised of 376 parents of 188 preadolescents who had never had either atopic disturbances or any other serious disease. The results showed that both groups of parents felt their children were capable of autonomously managing their disease, and that they see medical facilities as their primary resource. Children were not perceived as being altered by their illness, although their illness undoubtedly Affected_HP family relationships; this was particularly true in the case of families with members who experience atopic problems. The factors causing the greatest difficulties were: disagreements over treatment, Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP caused by the disease, and the sacrifices made by family members as a result of illness.

Effect of salbutamol on Gastroesophageal_reflux_HP in Healthy_HP volunteers and patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The aim of this work was to establish whether beta-adrenergic agonists promote or increase Gastroesophageal_reflux_HP in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Ten Healthy_HP individuals and eight patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were studied on 2 different days. One day they received a placebo, and the other day they received 4 mg of salbutamol by mouth. Complete measurements of esophageal manometry were performed before and every 30 minutes for 210 minutes after the administration of the drugs. Esophageal pH was measured continuously for the duration of the experiment. The results demonstrate that (1) salbutamol had no effect on the lower esophageal sphincter pressure gradient, the peak esophageal contraction pressure, or the number and duration of reflux episodes in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and normal individuals, and (2) patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP have a resting lower esophageal sphincter pressure higher than Healthy_HP subjects. We conclude that the administration of salbutamol does not Affect_ASDPTO esophageal function.

Source of the aeroallergen of soybean dust: a low molecular mass glycopeptide from the soybean tela.Airborne soybean allergens in the dust generated during the unloading of soybeans in the harbor caused Asthma_ASDPTO_HP epidemics in Barcelona, Spain. The major allergen causing the epidemics was a glycopeptide less than 14 kd molecular mass abundant in soybean dust. This allergen occurs in all parts of the soybean plant at all stages of growth, but the telae (hulls) and pods are by far the richest source. Small amounts of a similar cross-reacting allergen are found in some other grain dusts. The botanical function and significance of this soybean plant component is not known nor is the potential for airborne dispersion of this allergen at other grain-handling sites.

Cellular and biochemical characteristics of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in symptomatic nonallergic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.We have undertaken cellular and biochemical examination of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from nonallergic patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP to determine the nature and degree of inflammatory process in symptomatic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Six patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (mean methacholine provocative concentration causing a 20% fall in FEV1 was 0.26 mg/ml) and six control subjects underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar wash. The patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP shed a higher number of epithelial cells into lavage fluid than normal control subjects (p less than 0.05). Their lavage fluid also contained increased numbers of neutrophils (p less than 0.025), eosinophils (p less than 0.025), and basophilic cells (p less than 0.025), and increased proportion of activated T cells (p less than 0.05). The basophilic cells were mast cells, as indicated by positive labeling with the monoclonal antibody MCG35. Biochemical analysis of lavage fluid demonstrated exudation of protein molecules in airways of patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP with increased contents of albumin (p less than 0.05) and fibronectin (p less than 0.05). In the lavage fluid of patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, there were also increased amounts of interleukin-1-beta (IL-1-beta) (p less than 0.025), interleukin-6 (IL-6) (p less than 0.025), and granulocyte-macrophage, colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (p less than 0.05), as compared with lavage fluid of normal control subjects. Immunocytochemical evaluation of lavage cells demonstrated that IL-1-beta, IL-6, and GM-CSF were mostly produced by nonciliated epithelial cells and/or monocytes. IL-1, IL-6, and GM-CSF can prime granulocytes to respond to other stimuli and can promote T cell activation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Differences in mediator release between Allergic_Rhinitis_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.To determine why patients with Allergic_Rhinitis_HP alone differ in their airway response to inhaled allergen compared to patients with allergic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, bronchial lavage was performed in 10 subjects with allergic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and in five subjects with Allergic_Rhinitis_HP, before and after inhalation challenge with antigen to produce an immediate asthmatic reaction. Before antigen challenge, the subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP had higher absolute neutrophil counts in the lavage fluid. After antigen challenge, the subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP released significant amounts of bronchoconstrictive mediators, such as histamine and thromboxane B2 into the lavage fluid, whereas subjects with Rhinitis_HP alone did not. There was also a significant increase in prostaglandin E2 in the subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP after antigen challenge. Nonimmunologic bronchoconstriction with methacholine inhalation challenge in six other subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP did not demonstrate an increase in any of the lavage fluid mediator levels that were measured. A positive correlation was found between methacholine provocative concentration causing a 20% drop in FEV1 and the concentration of prostaglandin E2 in the lavage fluid before challenge. The significance of this observation has yet to be determined. The results suggest that subjects with allergic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP differ from subjects with Rhinitis_HP alone in their capacity to release more mediators into the airways on antigen challenge. It is not known whether this increase in mediators is due to increase in the number of mast cells in the airways or due to increase in mediator releasability from the mast cells of subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Theophylline analysis at the chest clinic--comparison of a portable versus conventional system.The running cost and clinical application of a new, portable, direct-injection, high-performance, liquid chromatograph for the measurement of theophylline was compared with conventional laboratory-based analysis by studying the two methods in two parallel chest clinics. Thirty-six patients were managed with the portable method and 33 by the conventional system. They were already receiving theophylline preparations for treatment of their Asthma_ASDPTO_HP or Chronic_HP airflow limitation. Over the 12-week period of study, the percentage of patients with levels in the therapeutic range rose from 33% to approximately 87% in both clinics, but this change was achieved in only 6 weeks using the portable system. Patients whose theophylline levels were increased into the therapeutic range had improved symptom scores as measured by visual analogue scales but we were unable to demonstrate any significant change in spirometry. The cost of the portable system compared favourably with laboratory analysis, and had the additional benefit of quicker detection of non-compliance and facility for discussion with the patients at the time of consultation.

[Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and bronchial hyperreactivity. Current concepts].During the last decade much progress has been done in the understanding of the pathogenesis of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The concept of a bronchospastic disease has been replaced by that of a Chronic_HP desquamating eosinophilic Bronchitis_HP. Bronchial inflammation is primarily responsible for airway hyperresponsiveness, the hallmark of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. An abnormality of a subtype of muscarinic receptors probably plays a permissive role.

The Scimitar_anomaly_HP.The clinical spectrum of the Scimitar_anomaly_HP ranges from severely ill infants to asymptomatic adults. The true incidence of the disorder is unknown because the syndrome may remain undetected in asymptomatic patients until a chest roentgenogram is obtained. We have presented the contrasting clinical experiences of two adult women, one with few symptoms and a benign course, and the other with exacerbation of her Asthma_ASDPTO_HP from Recurrent_HP_upper_respiratory_tract_infections_HP originating in the lower lobe of her Right_HP lung. Improvement resulted from surgical resection of this congenitally abnormal, bronchiectatic segment of lung.

Prescribed fenoterol and death from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in New Zealand, 1981-7: a further case-control study.The association between inhaled fenoterol and death from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP has been investigated further by studying 112 Asthma_ASDPTO_HP deaths (cases) during 1981-7 in patients aged 5-45 years who had been admitted to a major hospital for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP during the 12 months before death. Two age matched control groups were chosen. Control group A comprised 427 patients who had been admitted to hospital for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP during the calendar year that the corresponding death occurred and who had also had a previous admission for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in the previous 12 months. Control group B comprised 448 patients admitted to hospital for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP during the calendar year in which the admission of the corresponding case occurred. The inhaled fenoterol odds ratio was 2.11 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.37-3.23, p less than 0.01) when group A was used as the control (the approach used in previous studies), and 2.66 (95% CI 1.74-4.06, p less than 0.01) with group B as the control (the approach recommended by critics of previous studies). Markers of Chronic_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Severity_HP were associated with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP death when control group B was used, but not when control group A was used (which indicates that these markers were indirectly matched for when control group A was used). Information was also collected on various markers of Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Severity_HP and prescription of psychotropic drugs, but it was found that these were not important confounders. These findings address the major criticisms of previous case-control studies of this issue, and add support to the hypothesis that inhaled fenoterol increases the risk of death in patients with Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Compliance in clinical trials of two nonbronchodilator, antiasthma Medications_ASDPTO.An electronic monitoring device was used to assess patient compliance during clinical trials of two new aerosolized nonbronchodilator, antiasthma drugs. Compliance was poor, but similar, in both trials. Patients took the study drug as instructed on a mean of 37.3% days (range 10% to 77%) in one trial and 37.4% days (range 0% to 63%) in the other. Both underuse and overuse were observed. Underuse was seen on a mean of 38.9% days (range 9% to 81%) and 46.0% (range 15% to 80%) respectively; overuse on a mean of 23.5% days (range 6% to 54%) and 16.6% days (range 0% to 41%). In some patients ten or more activations of the device were recorded at the same time. In six patients such multiple simultaneous activations were recorded on two or more separate days. These patients were among the most noncompliant in the study. Multiple simultaneous activations frequently followed underuse days or preceded followup visits, suggesting the possibility of duplicity. Overall compliance was such that valid conclusions about efficacy of the drugs could only have been drawn in six of 34 patients.

Occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and rhinoconjunctivitis from inhalation of crystalline bovine serum albumin powder.A 24-year-old white female laboratory technician developed Recurrent_HP rhinoconjunctivitis and Wheezing_HP immediately following repeated exposure to purified lyophilized bovine serum albumin (BSA). Prick and titrated intradermal skin tests revealed strongly positive results in the patient and negative results in normal controls. A titrated double-blind, placebo-controlled bronchial inhalation challenge with an aqueous BSA solution was positive at 10 mg/mL. Use of an albuterol metered dose inhaler and avoidance of laboratory exposure to BSA have resulted in resolution of symptoms. These results are consistent with an IgE-mediated mechanism, and this case represents the first reported instance of occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and rhinoconjunctivitis to inhaled BSA powder.

Asthmatic patients with panic disorders: report of three cases with management and outcome.Panic disorders, a subgroup of the primary Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP_Disorders_ASDPTO, have an estimated worldwide prevalence of 2.5% to 5%. Although the causes of these disorders have not been completely elucidated, it seems that environmental and genetic factors in addition to Central_HP nervous system biochemical abnormalities play important roles. Mild_HP to Moderate_HP Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP levels may prove advantageous in the management of asthmatics but when their Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP level becomes maladaptive, as in the case of panic attacks, their medical care is placed in jeopardy. Herein are three case reports of asthmatics who also exhibited panic disorders and their clinical outcome. It is concluded that a team approach, involving the primary physician and psychologist or psychiatrist, is beneficial in the long-term management of these patients.

Bambuterol: a new long acting bronchodilating prodrug.Bambuterol, a carbamate prodrug of terbutaline as a 5, 10, or 20-mg tablet, was given once every evening to patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in a randomized double-blind crossover study. Twenty milligrams improved pulmonary functions over 24 hours; 5 and 10 mg did not. Few side effects were observed.

Improved stability in oral delivery of albuterol provides less variability in bronchodilation in adults with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The objective of this randomized, single-blind, parallel group study was to determine whether a more constant rate of albuterol delivery from tablets provides less variability in bronchodilation. Thirty-eight adult patients were enrolled with FEV1 between 40% to 80% of predicted normal and greater than or equal to 15% reversibility. Eighteen patients received Volmax, 8 mg bid, and 20 patients received Proventil Repetabs, 8 mg (as two 4-mg tablets) bid. The magnitude and duration of bronchodilation were determined after the first dose and at steady state on treatment day 7 by measuring serial values of pulmonary function for 12 hours on each day. Interpatient variability in bronchodilation was calculated for each study day did not differ significantly between treatments, the interpatient variability in bronchodilation with Volmax was, on average, one-half of that experienced with Proventil Repetabs. Adverse events, mainly Headache_HP and Tremor_HP, were comparable between Volmax and Proventil Repetabs. This study demonstrates that Volmax achieves less variable bronchodilation through a more constant rate of drug delivery from the Onset_HP of therapy.

The allergic patient who is noncompliant and abusive: dealing with the adverse experience.The field of Allergy_HP-Immunology is involved with the care of patients with Chronic_HP illness. The care of these patients is enhanced when the physician has established good rapport with the patient. The noncompliant, disruptive behavior of some patients can try the patience of even the most understanding physicians and, in turn, impede the delivery of care. Interactions with this type of patient may leave the physician with feelings of guilt, frustration, and helplessness. We review such an encounter with the purpose of describing how to deal with this type of patient and to guide the physician in responding to this adverse behavior. Such patients will usually require limits to be set on behavioral acting out for their own best interest. Further, it is often necessary to make continued care contingent on compliance with the ground rules set. The physician must be aware of his or her adverse feelings toward the patient and be able to interpret the behavior in the context of the psychiatric disorder so that appropriate psychologic help for the patient can be provided.

Early Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Onset_HP: consideration of parenting issues.This report examines the relationship between early parental behavior and the later Onset_HP of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in a cohort of 150 children who were genetically at risk for developing Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Judgments of both parenting problems and maternal coping were made during a home visit when the infant was 3 weeks old. A clinical interview with the mother was developed and reliably coded. The sample was divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of concerns about coping and parenting. During the following 2 years, the respiratory status of the children was monitored. Four categories of respiratory status were defined: (1) Asthma_ASDPTO_HP; (2) Recurrent_HP infectious Wheezing_HP; (3) a single isolated Wheezing_HP episode; or (4) no Wheezing_HP. Early problems in coping and parenting were associated with the later Onset_HP of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (p less than 0.001). Furthermore, parents of children who developed Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were more likely to have been having difficulties at the 3-week visit than those whose children developed infectious Wheezing_HP (p less than 0.005).
Early asthma onset: consideration of parenting issues.This report examines the relationship between early parental behavior and the later onset of asthma in a cohort of 150 children who were genetically at risk for developing asthma.

Atopic disease and immunoglobulin E in twins reared apart and together.Both genetic and environmental influences have been implicated in the etiology of atopic disease and in the determination of serum IgE levels. To quantify the relative contribution of these influences, we studied the prevalence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and seasonal Rhinitis_HP, skin-test response, total serum IgE levels, and specific IgE, as measured by RAST, in a sample of MZ and DZ twins reared apart or together. Concordance rates for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, Rhinitis_HP, positive skin tests, and RAST were calculated. MZ twins, whether reared apart or together, showed a greater concordance than dizygotic twins reared apart or together. Maximum-likelihood tests of genetic and environmental components of the variation of total IgE levels revealed a substantial genetic component and a negligible contribution from common familial environmental effects.

Allergy_HP and Allergy_HP-like symptoms in 1,050 medical students.During a 10-year period 1,050 medical students were questioned regarding Allergy_HP and Allergy_HP-like symptoms and 612 of them underwent skin prick tests with dog, cat, timothy and birch allergens. Symptoms of Eczema_HP, Asthma_ASDPTO_HP or non-infectious Rhinitis_HP, past or current, or current reactions to pollen, furred animals, dust, mould or food were reported by 46% of the students. Three per cent reported present Eczema_HP of the flexure type and a further 8% reported past symptoms of the same kind. Current contact e zema was reported by 7% and past contact Eczema_HP by a further 3%. Daily treatment with ointments was reported by 52% of the students with current flexure Eczema_HP and by 17% with current contact Eczema_HP. Current Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was reported by 5% and past Asthma_ASDPTO_HP by a further 3%. Of those with current Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, 88% were allergic to pollens and/or furred animals and 57% used anti-asthmatic drugs for at least 2 weeks/year. Current allergic symptoms in the nose and/or eyes were reported by 29% and a further 2% reported past symptoms. Of those with current symptoms 64% were allergic to pollens and/or furred animals, as judged by the history and skin tests. Almost 60% of the students with pollen Allergy_HP used anti-allergic drugs for at least 2 weeks/year. Allergy_HP to pollens was reported by 17%, to animals by 12%, to house dust by 10%, to moulds by 2% and to foods by 15%. Allergy_HP reported and confirmed by a prick test was found in 8% against birch, 6% against timothy, 10% against cat and 5% against dog.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Effect of hyperoxia on bronchial response to inhaled methacholine.Bronchial reactivity to methacholine (MCH) under normoxic and hyperoxic conditions was studied in a double-blind controlled study in 10 normal subjects and nine asthmatic patients. The normal volunteers were challenged while breathing dry, 21% and 100% O2, and the maximal percent Falls_HP in forced expired volume in is (FEV1) following inhalation of the highest concentration of MCH (64 mg/ml) were 8 +/- 5% and 9 +/- 8%, respectively; P = NS. The asthmatic patients had their MCH challenge breathing the same gas composition and the provocative concentrations that caused a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20) were 0.18 mg/ml (range 0.06-5.73) and 0.25 mg/ml (range 0.07-8.49), respectively, which were statistically not significantly different. We conclude that in humans, 100% O2 does not Affect_ASDPTO bronchial reactivity to MCH.

Efficacy of enprofylline in Acute_HP airway obstruction.The efficacy and safety of different regimens of intravenously administered enprofylline, an anti-Asthma_ASDPTO_HP xanthine, were evaluated in a randomized open study, including 155 patients with Acute_HP exacerbation of Obstructive_lung_disease_HP. The regimen 2.5 mg/kg i.v. over 10 min was canceled after seven patients had been included, due to two cases of hypotensive/vasovagal reactions. The regimens 2.0 mg/kg/20 min and 2.5 mg/kg/20 min were significantly more effective with regard to bronchodilation than 2.0 mg/kg/10 min (PEF increase +35%, +30% and +17% respectively). Nausea_HP and Headache_HP were the most common side effects (16-33% and 23-33% of the patients respectively on different regimens) with the lowest Frequency_HP on 2.0 mg/kg/20 min. Four additional hypotensive reactions occurred; one on each 2.0 mg/kg regimen and two on 2.5 mg/kg/20 min. The regimen 2.0 mg/kg20 min was found to be the most favourable with regard to efficacy and side effects. Enprofylline i.v. was found to be an effective bronchodilating treatment of Acute_HP airway obstruction but the Frequency_HP of side effects has to be considered.

The role of platelet-activating factor in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.There is a large body of in vitro, animal, and now human data that provide strong support for PAF as being an important mediator of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and airway hyperreactivity. Unfortunately, there is little direct, unequivocal evidence that this is so. Direct evidence will come from studies that test the effectiveness of potent, nontoxic, PAF receptor antagonists in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Another issue that needs to be addressed is the mechanism by which PAF produces bronchoconstriction and, in particular, airway hyperreactivity. Studies exploring the effect of PAF on inflammatory cell populations and functions in the lung, on other mediators (i.e., leukotrienes), and on the nonadrenergic, noncholinergic nervous system in human subjects are needed. Finally, identification of the basis for the variable response to PAF in normal subjects and in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP should provide further insight into PAF's mechanism of action and the pathogenesis of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and airway hyperreactivity.

The role of leukotriene antagonists and inhibitors in the treatment of airway disease.Since the early recognition that leukotrienes are generated in response to allergen exposure, a role for these multipurpose mediators has been sought. The pharmacologic actions of the leukotrienes and their cell sources were strong evidence that they should contribute to allergic airway disease. That promise is now being fulfilled. Potent leukotriene receptor antagonists and enzyme inhibitors of leukotriene generation are now being investigated. With the availability of these new compounds, not only will greater insight to leukotrienes in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP become apparent, but possibly newer, more effective therapeutics. Of additional interest and relevance is the potential role of leukotrienes in other nonrespiratory inflammatory diseases such as Inflammation_of_the_large_intestine_HP, Rheumatoid_Arthritis_HP, and Psoriasiform_dermatitis_HP. Therefore, the role of leukotrienes in inflammation is not limited to the respiratory system but are more universal in their ability to cause tissue injury. Consequently, studies that have shown benefit from inhibition of leukotriene synthesis and antagonism of the LTD4 receptor in respiratory diseases are suggestive that such an approach will also be beneficial in other inflammatory diseases. For example, a study of 72 patients with A-64077 (zileuton) has demonstrated that 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors are efficacious in the treatment of Inflammation_of_the_large_intestine_HP. Therefore, the contribution of leukotrienes to inflammation is likely to be a global phenomenon, and the introduction of leukotriene antagonists and 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors may represent the beginning of a new era for the treatment of many inflammatory diseases.

The potential roles of leukotrienes in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Leukotrienes (LTs), in particular LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4, have been shown to be capable of participating in the induction of three related processes observed during the immediate reaction in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP: Edema_HP formation, mucus secretion, and muscle contraction. Despite impressive evidence potentially implicating the LTs, the role of LTs in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is still unproved, and a positive answer to their critical actions in causing airflow obstruction will require studies with specific antagonists.

Nebulized atropine sulfate in the treatment of Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Conflicting reports have appeared concerning the role of anticholinergic agents in the treatment of Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. This study was designed to determine whether atropine sulfate, the only anticholinergic agent currently available in the United States for nebulization, increases bronchodilation when added to an inhaled beta-adrenergic agonist during the initial treatment of an Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attack. Adults asthmatics (n = 40) with Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attacks were randomized to receive metaproterenol (5 percent solution, 0.3 ml) either alone or with atropine sulfate (2.5 mg), by nebulization. Spirometry, vital signs, and the presence of side effects 0, 30, 60, and 120 minutes after treatment were determined. There were no significant differences between the metaproterenol alone and metaproterenol plus atropine sulfate groups in regard to age, duration of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, baseline spirometry, or side effects. No differences were noted between the two groups regarding changes in FEV1 and FVC from baseline (expressed in milliliters or as a percentage of baseline) during the observation period. We conclude that nebulized atropine sulfate yields no additional benefit when added to metaproterenol during the initial treatment of an Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attack.

Facilitation of mechanical ventilation in Status_asthmaticus_HP with continuous intravenous thiopental.Mechanical ventilation in Status_asthmaticus_HP is associated with a significant mortality and morbidity. To facilitate Recurrent_HP positive pressure ventilation (IPPV), we have used continuous IV thiopental (thiopentone) together with traditional ventilatory techniques. With this policy, we were able to achieve rapid correction of arterial blood gas tensions in a group of 20 Severe_HP asthmatics requiring IPPV. By 1 hour, peak airway pressure (PAP) had fallen from 58.6 +/- 15.7 to 30.2 +/- 10.9 cm H2O (p less than 0.001). During the same period, PaCO2 fell from 51.3 +/- 15.3 to 40.17 +/- 8.2 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and pH rose from 7.25 +/- 0.1 to 7.33 +/- 0.1 (p less than 0.001). Morbidity was low and in particular, no episode of barotrauma was noted. All patients survived the Acute_HP attack and were successfully liberated from the ventilator. We conclude that these results are largely attributable to our use of early and continuous IV anesthesia induced by thiopental.

With this policy, we were able to achieve rapid correction of arterial blood gas tensions in a group of 20 severe asthmatics requiring IPPV. By 1 hour, peak airway pressure (PAP) had fallen from 58.6 +/- 15.7 to 30.2 +/- 10.9 cm H2O (p less than 0.001). During the same period, PaCO2 fell from 51.3 +/- 15.3 to 40.17 +/- 8.2 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and pH rose from 7.25 +/- 0.1 to 7.33 +/- 0.1 (p less than 0.001). Morbidity was low and in particular, no episode of barotrauma was noted. All patients survived the acute attack and were successfully liberated from the ventilator. We conclude that these results are largely attributable to our use of early and continuous IV anesthesia induced by thiopental.
Inhaled epinephrine and oral theophylline-ephedrine in the treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Inhaled and oral over-the-counter bronchodilators are used for self-therapy by asthmatic patients. To evaluate their safety and efficacy, we compared epinephrine and theophylline combined with ephedrine with inhaled metaproterenol and the placebo. Twelve asthmatic patients were studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial comparing forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) after two inhalations of epinephrine (0.2 mg/inh), 1 minute apart, followed in 15 minutes by theophylline (130 mg) with ephedrine (24 mg) versus two inhalations of metaproterenol (0.65 mg/inh), 1 minute apart, versus placebo inhaler and tablets. Onset_HP of FEV1 greater than 15% above baseline values occurred within 15 seconds after inhalations for 100% of epinephrine-treated patients, 92% of metaproterenol-treated patients, and 33% of placebo-treated patients. FEV1 responses were significantly greater (P less than .05) for epinephrine at 0.66 to 1.66 minutes compared with the responses of metaproterenol, and epinephrine and theophylline that was combined with ephedrine compared with metaproterenol beginning at 2 hours. Mean duration of activity was 5.7 hours for the epinephrine- and theophylline with ephedrine-treated patients, 4.9 hours for metaproterenol-treated patients, and 2 hours for the placebo group. There were statistically significant differences for patients receiving epinephrine and theophylline with ephedrine versus the placebo group (P less than .001), metaproterenol patients versus the placebo group (P = .02), and patients receiving epinephrine and theophylline with ephedrine versus metaproterenol-treated patients (P less than .05). Compared with inhaled metaproterenol, inhaled epinephrine followed in 15 minutes by a theophylline-ephedrine tablet had a significantly earlier Onset_HP, longer duration of action, numerically greater peak effect, and patient preference.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Concomitant medical disease and Headache_HP.The treatment of Headache_HP disorders in patients with concomitant medical illness constitutes one of the more challenging areas of Headache_HP therapy. As new agents are added to our pharmacologic armamentarium, it will become easier to tailor therapy to our patients. The physician who treats the Headache_HP patient with concomitant medical illness must be particularly aware of drug side effects and pharmacology in order to prevent a worsening of underlying medical conditions or an exacerbation of Headache_HPs.

Risk factors associated with Chronic_HP_Fatigue_HP syndrome in a cluster of pediatric cases.After seven pediatric cases of Chronic_HP_Fatigue_HP syndrome (CFS) were diagnosed in a farming community in upstate New York, a questionnaire regarding symptoms and potential risk factors of CFS was distributed to all students enrolled in the same school district. Twenty-one students with symptoms of CFS were identified. Two controls per case matched for age and sex were randomly selected from questionnaire respondents. Health_status_HP was verified for all subjects by telephone, and Diagnosis_ASDPTO of CFS was confirmed by a physician. Information was collected on the following factors: symptoms of CFS among other family members; history of Allergy_HP/Asthma_ASDPTO_HP; consumption of raw milk, raw eggs, raw cheese, or raw meat; water supply; exposure to animals; home heating source; proximity to farmland/orchards; tick bite; blood transfusion; camping; and appendicitis. Logistic-regression analyses indicated that the best model (characterized by symptoms among other family members, recent ingestion of raw milk, and history of Allergy_HP/Asthma_ASDPTO_HP) produced significant estimates of relative risk (P less than .05) of 35.9, 44.3, and 23.3, respectively, for the three factors (corrections were made for the effect of the other covariates). These data suggest that a combination of host and environmental factors, including an infectious agent or agents, are involved in the etiology of CFS.

Adrenocortical suppression following treatment with beclomethasone and budesonide.The study was carried out to compare the adrenocortical suppression caused by inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) with the suppression caused by budesonide (Bu). The study was of an open cross-over design. Sixteen children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were treated with high-dose inhaled BDP and Bu via a 750 ml spacer (Nebuhaler). Each drug was used for periods of 6 weeks. The 24-hr urinary cortisol excretion was unchanged in 11 subjects. A reproducible suppression of the urinary cortisol excretion was shown in three subjects following BDP and in two subjects following treatment with Bu. The results of the study indicate the occurrence of interpersonal variations of the sensitivity to the adrenocortical suppressive effect of BDP and Bu.

The significance of late responses in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.There is good evidence to suggest that the late response is a valid clinical model of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The factors which predict late responses in individual subjects are unknown although recent studies suggest that the level of IgE sensitivity and allergen dose are two important variables. Recent placebo-controlled pharmacological studies support earlier work and vindicate the use of late responses as a preclinical screening test in the evaluation of new therapeutic agents. In addition to putative pro-inflammatory mechanisms we should evaluate possible protective mechanisms which might prevent the development of late responses in individual subjects. In this regard, altered adrenal responses as reflected by serum cortisol concentrations did not appear to play a role, protective or otherwise in the development of late asthmatic responses. In conclusion, the development of symptomatic late responses and associated increased bronchial responsiveness are relevant to day-to-day Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. As suggested by Cockcroft, repeated allergen exposure may result in a vicious cycle of ongoing bronchial inflammation. This emphasizes the importance of allergen avoidance and the need for earlier intervention in Mild_HP to Moderate_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP with effective prophylactic agents which are known to inhibit late responses.

Expression of mRNA for interleukin-5 in mucosal bronchial biopsies from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.We have attempted to identify mRNA for IL-5 in endobronchial mucosal biopsies from asthmatics and controls, using the technique of in situ hybridization. Bronchial biopsies were obtained from 10 asthmatics and 9 nonatopic normal controls. A radio-labeled cRNA probe was prepared from an IL-5 cDNA and hybridized to permeabilized sections. These were washed extensively before processing for autoradiography. An IL-5-producing T cell clone derived from a patient with the hyper-IgE syndrome was used as a positive control. As a negative control, sections were also treated with a "sense" IL-5 probe. Specific hybridization signals for IL-5 mRNA were demonstrated within the bronchial mucosa in 6 out of the 10 asthmatic subjects. Cells exhibiting hybridization signals were located beneath the epithelial basement membrane. In contrast, there was no hybridization in the control group. No hybridization was observed with the sense probe. The six IL-5 mRNA-positive asthmatics tended to have more Severe_HP disease than the negative asthmatics, as assessed by symptoms and lung function, and showed a significant increase in the degree of infiltration of the bronchial mucosa by secreting (EG2+) eosinophils and activated (CD25+) T lymphocytes. Within the subjects who showed positive IL-5 mRNA, there was a correlation between IL-5 mRNA expression and the number of CD25+ and EG2+ cells and total eosinophil count. This study provides evidence for the cellular localization of IL-5 mRNA in the bronchial mucosa of asthmatics and supports the concept that this cytokine regulates eosinophil function in bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Childhood sexual abuse in patients with paradoxical Vocal_cord_dysfunction_HP.We present three prototypical cases of paradoxical Vocal_cord_dysfunction_HP. The symptoms of this functional disorder mimic those of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attacks. These patients typically have experienced extensive medical intervention including intubation and corticosteroid use. We identify a history of childhood sexual abuse as an important factor contributing to the development of this psychosomatic disorder. We discuss the Severity_HP of psychopathology in patients with paradoxical Vocal_cord_dysfunction_HP and how this physical symptom may have developed to express psychological difficulties.

A scale for assessing quality of life in adult Asthma_ASDPTO_HP sufferers.The Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Questionnaire is a 68-item quality of life scale designed to be sensitive to quality of life changes in clinical trials. The questionnaire covers 11 domains of life experience, the initial domain and item sets being derived from six qualitative focus groups of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP patients. Psychometric analysis of responses of 101 Asthma_ASDPTO_HP patients to the initial 101-item set showed the scale to be unidimensional despite being multi-domain, and the finding of unidimensionality was replicated during the further three stages of item refinement using 783 patients. The scale compensates for acquiescence bias as well as allowing a 'not applicable' response category. Validity of the scale was demonstrated by confirmation of expected group differences and the retest reliability was 0.948.

[Changes in the lipid composition of cell membranes in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP after glucocorticosteroid therapy].Levels of phospholipids (PL) and cholesterol (CS) were measured in erythrocytic membranes (EM) of 17 Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (BA) patients. A relationship was established between BA aggravations and elevated CS but reduced PL concentrations in EM. These parameters responded positively on day 10 of glucocorticosteroids administration. There was a good clinical effect. The changes observed may be attributed to decreasing EM viscosity improving the function of adenylate cyclase and to the action of glucocorticosteroids on phospholipase A2 by rising PL values. Some patients, in the presence of abnormal PL and CS levels, showed qualitative shifts in PL: lower proportion of sphingomyelin-containing PL. Further study of specific membrane impairment in BA promises introduction of new approaches to BA treatment.

Prevention in practice. New developments in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP management.Asthma_ASDPTO_HP management is turning from controlling symptoms as they occur to enabling sufferers to control their own condition to keep them symptom free. While this may mean Asthma_ASDPTO_HP clinics increase practices' prescribing costs, calls for emergency nebulisation should decrease, as should asthmatic consultations in general surgery.

[Occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP caused by scented gravel in cat litter boxes].Perfumes are now added to articles in everyday use to an increasing extent. One example of this is addition of perfume to gravel in cat toilets. It is recognized that perfumes may cause toxic and allergic skin reactions while perfume as the cause of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is not so well recognized. In the case described here, exposure to industrial perfume resulted in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP on account of irritation.

Bronchial challenge with adenosine causes the release of serum neutrophil chemotactic factor in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.In order to investigate the mechanism of adenosine-induced bronchoconstriction in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, serum neutrophil chemotactic activity (NCA) was measured in normal individuals and patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP before and 5 min after bronchoprovocation testing with adenosine. Challenge testing was terminated when the FEV1 fell by 20% or a concentration of 10 mg/ml was reached. Participants were separated into three groups: six asthmatics hyperresponsive to adenosine (Group 1), seven asthmatics hyperresponsive to histamine but not adenosine (Group 2), and six normal subjects (Group 3). The mean percentage increase in NCA was 84% for Group 1 (p less than 0.001), 29% for Group 2 (p less than 0.05), and only 13% for Group 3. No significant increase in NCA was observed after histamine challenge in seven individuals with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP derived from Groups 1 and 2. Four patients from Group 1 were rechallenged after treatment with therapeutic doses of oral theophylline. Theophylline therapy was associated with a significant attenuation of the increase in NCA at the concentration of adenosine which caused a 20% decrease in FEV1 before treatment (18% versus 84%, p less than 0.01). The concentration of adenosine which caused a 20% drop in FEV1 was increased at least twofold for each of the four patients. Analysis of NCA by gel filtration chromatography demonstrated an increase in a high molecular weight neutrophil chemotactic factor in the serum of two Group 1 patients after adenosine challenge. Release of a high molecular weight neutrophil chemotactic factor is consistent with a mast cell source for inflammatory mediators in adenosine-induced bronchoconstriction. The therapeutic effects of theophylline, a potent adenosine antagonist, in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP may therefore occur in part through the inhibition of this process.

Attenuation of inhaled allergen-induced airway microvascular leakage and airflow obstruction in guinea pigs by a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor (A-63162).Leukotrienes, products of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway in the metabolism of arachidonic acid, are potent mediators of airway microvascular leakage and smooth muscle contraction in guinea pigs. We studied the effect of a specific 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, A-63162, on airway microvascular leakage and airflow obstruction following inhaled ovalbumin in actively sensitized guinea pigs. Airway microvascular leakage was assessed by extravasation of Evans blue dye into airway tissues. Inhaled ovalbumin caused increased lung resistance (RL) with decreased dynamic compliance (CL) and increased extravasation of Evans blue dye at all airway levels. A-63162 reduced the changes in RL and CL at 1.0 mumol/kg (p less than 0.05) but not at lower doses of 0.1 and 0.3 mumol/kg. A-63162 reduced Evans blue dye extravasation in airway tissues at all three doses, however, being most effective in the Distal_HP airways (p less than 0.01), and these reductions were greater than those in RL and CL. A 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor thus reduced airway microvascular leakage to a greater extent than airflow obstruction, suggesting that leukotrienes have a larger contribution to changes in airway microvascular permeability than smooth muscle contraction following inhaled allergen challenge in actively sensitized guinea pigs in vivo.

Glucocorticoid receptor characteristics in monocytes of patients with corticosteroid-resistant Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The mechanism of corticosteroid resistance in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP has been studied by determining the rank order of potency for different corticosteroids in inhibiting the generation of a 3 kD molecule from Peripheral_HP blood monocytes isolated from corticosteroid-sensitive (CS) and corticosteroid-resistant (CR) Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic subjects, which augments leukotriene B4 (LTB4) generation by human neutrophils (PMN) stimulated by calcium ionophore. In addition, binding studies with (3H) dexamethasone have been performed to determine the dissociation constant (Kd) and receptor numbers (Ro) in the monocytes of these two groups of subjects. The concentration of corticosteroid producing 50% inhibition (IC50) was 600 nM, 70 nM, and 0.5 nM for hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, and dexamethasone, respectively, in monocytes from CS individuals. There was only weak inhibition of the generation of enhancing activity by the corticosteroids in the CR Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic individuals. The dexamethasone Kd was 2.45 +/- 0.58 nM (mean +/- SEM, n = 6) in the CS group and 1.6 +/- 0.35 nM (mean +/- SEM, n = 6) in the CR group of patients (p = 0.14). The Ro in the CS group was 3,605 +/- 984 binding sites per nucleus (mean +/- SEM, n = 6) and 4,757 +/- 692 binding sites per nucleus (mean +/- SEM, n = 6) in the CR group (p = 0.23). These findings indicate that corticosteroid resistance in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP cannot be explained by abnormalities in corticosteroid receptor characteristics.
Glucocorticoid receptor characteristics in monocytes of patients with corticosteroid-resistant bronchial asthma.The mechanism of corticosteroid resistance in bronchial asthma has been studied by determining the rank order of potency for different corticosteroids in inhibiting the generation of a 3 kD molecule from peripheral blood monocytes isolated from corticosteroid-sensitive (CS) and corticosteroid-resistant (CR) asthmatic subjects, which augments leukotriene B4 (LTB4) generation by human neutrophils (PMN) stimulated by calcium ionophore. In addition, binding studies with (3H) dexamethasone have been performed to determine the dissociation constant (Kd) and receptor numbers (Ro) in the monocytes of these two groups of subjects.

Morphology of the airway wall in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and in Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP.Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP (Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP) are complex conditions with imprecise definitions, which make definitive morphologic comparisons difficult. Broadly, the airways in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP are occluded by tenacious plugs of exudate and mucus, and there is fragility of airway surface epithelium, thickening of the reticular layer beneath the epithelial basal lamina, and bronchial vessel congestion and Edema_HP. There is increased inflammatory infiltrate comprising "activated" lymphocytes and eosinophils with release of granular content in the latter, and there is enlargement of bronchial smooth muscle, particularly in medium-sized bronchi. Three conditions contribute to Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP. In Chronic_HP Bronchitis_HP there is mucous hypersecretion with enlargement of tracheobronchial submucosal glands and a disproportionate increase of mucous acini. In small or Peripheral_HP airways disease, there is inflammation of bronchioli and mucous metaplasia and hyperplasia, with increased intraluminal mucus, increased wall muscle, fibrosis, and airway stenoses. Respiratory Bronchiolitis_HP is a critically important early lesion that may predispose to the development of centrilobular Emphysema_HP. The Severity_HP of Emphysema_HP, rather than type, appears to be the most important determinant of Chronic_HP deterioration of airflow, and in this there may be significant loss of elastic recoil prior to the observed morphologic destruction of the acinus.

The roles of inflammatory cells in the pathogenesis of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and of Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP.Studies of the inflammatory processes in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and in Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP have been hindered by the imprecise definitions of these diseases, the uncertainty as to the location of the relevant inflammatory sites for these diseases within the lungs, and the difficulties in relating observed histopathologic changes to the effects of particular proinflammatory leukocytes or their products. Circumstantial evidence exists implicating neutrophils, eosinophils, mast cells, and monocytes in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP pathogenesis based on increased numbers and activation of these cells in blood, BAL fluid, or biopsy material, and the propensity of these cells to release products causing tissue damage. There is increasing evidence that the accumulation and activation of these cells is orchestrated by lymphokines elaborated by sensitized T lymphocytes. In Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP, attention has been focused on the secretion of proteases by infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages, although there is no incontrovertible evidence that these are relevant to the disease pathogenesis in the majority of patients with normal serum concentrations of protease inhibitors. In the future, studies of the functions of inflammatory cells actually at the sites of inflammation using the techniques of immunocytochemistry and molecular biology may provide further information as to the role of these cells in the inflammatory processes associated with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP.

The increased responsiveness to inhaled methacholine in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP: combination of causative factors.In Asthma_ASDPTO_HP the dose-response curve to inhaled methacholine (MCh) is shifted leftwards and shows an increased slope and maximum. Two factors might contribute to the different form and Position_HP of this curve: (1) mediator-induced airway muscle hypersensitivity and (2) thickening of the airway wall. We attempted to estimate the effect of a combination of these two factors on the increase in airway resistance of a single isolated human airway to increasing concentrations of MCh. The result suggests that mediator-induced hypersensitivity to cholinergic stimuli may explain a small part of the leftward shift of the asthmatic dose-response curve to MCh, especially at lower levels of bronchoconstriction, and that increased thickness of the airway wall may be more important for the increased slope and maximum of the asthmatic dose-response curve.

Relationship of airway hyperresponsiveness to respiratory symptoms and Diurnal_HP peak flow variation in patients with Obstructive_lung_disease_HP. The Dutch CNSLD Study Group.This study reports on the relationship of airway hyperresponsiveness (AH) with respiratory symptoms and Diurnal_HP peak flow expiratory (PEF) variation in 221 hyperresponsive patients with moderately Severe_HP airways obstruction. The disease was in a Stable_HP phase in all patients. Closely adhering to the American Thoracic Society criteria, patients were divided into three syndrome diagnoses based on a standardized history: Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (n = 81), asthmatic Bronchitis_HP (AB, n = 69), and Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP [( Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP] n = 44); 27 subjects could not be placed in any group. Mean (+/- SEM) log2 PC20 histamine values were significantly lower in the asthmatic group (-2.77 +/- 0.20 mg/ml) than in the Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP (-0.89 +/- 0.29 mg/ml) and AB groups (-1.37 +/- 0.25 mg/ml; one-way ANOVA, p less than 0.001). However, considerable overlap of individual responses existed. Differences between the groups could not be attributed to differences in prechallenge FEV1 levels. For every level of FEV1, asthmatic subjects were more hyperresponsive than patients with Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP. The dependence of PC20 on prechallenge FEV1 was comparable in all groups. There was a significant correlation between the degree of AH and Diurnal_HP PEF variation (rho = -0.401, p less than 0.001), which was stronger in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (rho = -0.409) than in Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP (rho = -0.325). Despite this obvious association, a wide range of Diurnal_HP PEF variation values existed for every level of PC20, indicating that PEF variability and AH are not interchangeable. The relationships between symptoms and both AH levels and PEF variation were weak. No significant differences were found between syndrome Diagnosis_ASDPTO groups with respect to Diurnal_HP PEF variation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Total respiratory resistance and reactance in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, Chronic_Bronchitis_HP, and Emphysema_HP.A comparison was made of total respiratory resistance (Rrs) and reactance (Xrs) determined between 6 and 26 Hz by means of a forced oscillation technique in 27 patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (group A), 28 patients with Chronic_Bronchitis_HP (group B), and 20 patients with Emphysema_HP (group E) to examine whether the method can provide data capable of distinguishing among these diseases. The three groups demonstrated a similar reduction in the FEV1. In addition, static and dynamic lung volumes, maximal expiratory flows, diffusing capacity for CO, airway resistance (Raw), and elastic lung recoil were measured. The observed alterations of Rrs and Xrs consisted of an increase in Rrs, a decrease in Rrs with Frequency_HP, and a decrease in Xrs. However, significant differences were found between the three groups: Rrs at 6 Hz and average Rrs were most increased in group A, whereas the negative Frequency_HP dependence of Rrs and the decrease in Xrs were least pronounced in group E. In all groups Rrs at 6 Hz, the average slope of Rrs, and the average level of Xrs were tightly interrelated and showed in addition a high correlation with airway resistance; the correlations with FEV1 were less satisfactory. Discriminant analysis performed on the complete set of data, excluding diffusing capacity and elastic lung recoil, which were used as selection criteria, demonstrated that forced oscillation parameters were the most important factors discriminating among the groups.

Blood Eosinophilia_HP and FEV1. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses.A previous cross-sectional analysis of 1980 data from a population of working men in the Paris area has shown a significant relationship of blood Eosinophilia_HP to a reduced FEV1 among nonsmokers, remaining after excluding men with a history of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. In the present report, we reexamine this relationship, after taking into account Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and positive skin prick tests, using data collected in 1985 in a subsample of 363 men from the initial population. Blood Eosinophilia_HP, defined by 5% or more eosinophils or by 250 or more eosinophils per cubic millimeter appeared to be associated with a lower FEV1, primarily in nonsmokers. A difference of approximately 0.40 L was observed in never-smokers with Eosinophilia_HP (greater than or equal to 5% of eosinophils) compared with those without. This association persisted after exclusion of subjects with atopy, Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Longitudinally, no significant association was observed between 1980 Eosinophilia_HP and the annual FEV1 decline between 1980 and 1985, even in nonsmokers. The results of our cross-sectional analyses suggest that Asthma_ASDPTO_HP or Asthma_ASDPTO_HP-like disorder does not explain the association between Eosinophilia_HP and FEV1. The role of eosinophil in respiratory disorders may go beyond its intervention in Allergy_HP. Further longitudinal studies are needed to better understand discrepancies between cross-sectional and longitudinal data and whether Eosinophilia_HP is a risk factor for Chronic_HP air-flow limitation.

Changes in mucociliary clearance during Acute_HP exacerbations of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Previous studies have suggested that mucociliary clearance (MC) is impaired in asthmatic subjects. If so, impaired clearance may be an important factor in Acute_HP exacerbation. We proposed that if MC plays a significant role in Acute_HP illness, MC should be impaired during the exacerbation but improve after recovery. To test this hypothesis, five asthmatic patients with attacks requiring hospitalization underwent measurement of MC using radiolabeled aerosol and a gamma camera. They were studied on the second or third day after admission with repeat measurements after discharge. Spirometry was performed before all studies. After an equilibrium xenon scan (133Xe), which defined lung borders and measured regional volume, radiolabeled saline particles containing technetium-labeled (99mTC) sulfur colloid were deposited and used to label airway mucus. Deposition patterns were matched by regulating particle distribution and breathing pattern. MC was then measured as percentage retention of radioactivity at 10-min intervals for 2 h. When hospitalized, 96.0 +/- 2.06% (SEM) of the initial radioactivity was retained in the lung after 2 h, indicating little clearance of mucus from the lung. In fact, no significant changes were detected when activity at 120 min was compared with measurements at 10 min (99.2 +/- 0.22%, NS). After discharge clearance was markedly enhanced. That is, retention of lung activity was significantly lower at all time intervals from 10 min onward, with only 70.9 +/- 3.86% retained at 120 min (p = 0.008). During an asthmatic attack warranting hospital admission, MC is significantly impaired, with marked improvement following recovery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP caused by exposure to neurospora in a plywood factory worker.A 24 year old man developed Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP two years after starting to work in a plywood plant. Four years later the patient had to stop working because of the increasing Severity_HP of his Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Three months after leaving his job, the patient's Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was greatly improved. His job consisted of placing plywood sheets into a drying machine. The plywood sheets had stayed outside in wet conditions for at least four to six weeks and were usually covered with moulds. Drying the plywood sheets changed the mould into a fine orange powder. Exposure to this in the laboratory induced an isolated immediate asthmatic reaction. The same reaction was seen when the patient was challenged with an extract of the mould powder at a 0.1% w/v concentration. Skin prick test with the mould extract induced a weal and flare reaction and IgE antibodies against the dry mould powder were identified. A control patient with the same degree of bronchial hyperreactivity did not have any asthmatic reaction when challenged with the same mould extract. Culture of the dry mould powder on Sabouraud agar plates grew pure Neurospora sp. This mould has not been previously reported as a cause of occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The immunological mechanism is probably related to an IgE mediated mast cell Allergy_HP.

The many facets of occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is an all-encompassing term that describes Asthma_ASDPTO_HP derived from, worsened by, or encountered in an occupational setting. The Diagnosis_ASDPTO can be elusive and is Confusion_HP with other disorders. Nevertheless, clarity of the Diagnosis_ASDPTO is essential for legal purposes. To best serve the patient, it is important to be familiar with the legal distinctions as well as proper medical management techniques.

Asthma_ASDPTO_HP: current strategies for treatment.Mortality from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is increasing, raising questions about the goals and adequacy of treatment. It is important to understand the pathophysiology of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and the rationale and options for treatment. Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, a reversible syndrome of airflow obstruction, is not simply spasm of airway smooth muscle; rather, it is a disease characterized by mucosal Edema_HP, mucous hypersecretion, and epithelial damage in the airway. Appropriate medical therapy includes treatment with compounds that specifically suppress airway inflammation. The best approach to treatment may be an anti-inflammatory agent--preferably by inhalation--along with an inhaled direct bronchodilator, with objective measures of airflow limitation to assess disease Severity_HP.

An open-label study of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin in Severe_HP childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Eight pediatric patients with Severe_HP steroid-dependent Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were enrolled in an open-label trial of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in an attempt to decrease their steroid requirements. Monthly therapy with high-dose IVIG resulted in a threefold decrease in both maintenance oral corticosteroid dose and in extra oral corticosteroids needed for control of exacerbations of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. This was accompanied by significant improvements in peak expiratory flow rates and in symptom-score rating. An immunomodulatory effect of IVIG was suggested by the changes in immediate skin test reactivity. Seven of the eight patients demonstrated one or more reactions to a panel of allergens before therapy. During the course of the trial, there was a Progressive_HP diminution in skin test reactivity with a 100-fold reduction in sensitivity at the completion of 6 months of therapy. In this preliminary study, the reduction in steroid requirements, improvement in symptoms and peak flow measurements, and diminution in immediate skin test reactivity support a potential role for IVIG in the treatment of Severe_HP steroid-dependent Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. A larger, randomized trial now appears warranted.

Asthma_ASDPTO_HP symptoms, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and atopy in a Maori and European adolescent population.In 1989 a survey of 543 New Zealand rural adolescents of largely Maori descent was undertaken to determine the prevalence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP symptoms, bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) and atopy. The overall prevalence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was estimated at 13.7%, BHR at 13.4% and atopy at 31.1%. These rates were similar across the age range 13 to 18 years. The prevalence of BHR among those without Asthma_ASDPTO_HP symptoms was 3%. Both current Asthma_ASDPTO_HP symptoms and BHR were more common among females, but there was no difference between the sexes in the proportion with atopy. The prevalence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP symptoms was higher among Maoris than nonMaoris, but this difference disappeared when allowance was made for current Smoking_ASDPTO. There was a similar prevalence of BHR and atopy between these two ethnic groups. There was a similar prevalence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP but lower prevalence of BHR than was reported among 7-10 year olds in an urban Auckland survey. The low prevalence of BHR among those without Asthma_ASDPTO_HP symptoms, and the uniform Frequency_HP of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP symptoms, BHR and atopy over the age range suggest that adolescents would be a particularly useful population for national or international comparisons of the prevalence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, BHR and atopy.

The overall prevalence of asthma was estimated at 13.7%, BHR at 13.4% and atopy at 31.1%. These rates were similar across the age range 13 to 18 years. The prevalence of BHR among those without asthma symptoms was 3%. Both current asthma symptoms and BHR were more common among females, but there was no difference between the sexes in the proportion with atopy. The prevalence of asthma symptoms was higher among Maoris than nonMaoris, but this difference disappeared when allowance was made for current smoking. There was a similar prevalence of BHR and atopy between these two ethnic groups. There was a similar prevalence of asthma but lower prevalence of BHR than was reported among 7-10 year olds in an urban Auckland survey. The low prevalence of BHR among those without asthma symptoms, and the uniform frequency of asthma symptoms, BHR and atopy over the age range suggest that adolescents would be a particularly useful population for national or international comparisons of the prevalence of asthma, BHR and atopy.

Effect of injected long-acting epinephrine in addition to aerosolized albuterol in the treatment of Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in children.The additional effect, if any, of subcutaneous, long-acting epinephrine (Sus-Phrine) to aerosolized albuterol for Acute_HP pediatric Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was studied. Over an eight-month period, patients were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, controlled trial. All patients were recruited and studied in a pediatric emergency department. Forty-three children between the ages of three and 12 years, with a mean age of 8.9 years, presenting with Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were enrolled. Group 1 received Sus-Phrine, 0.005 ml per kg before albuterol aerosols, as appropriate. Group 2 only received albuterol aerosols. There was no significant difference in the extent of improvement between the two groups at either 20 minutes or two hours for clinical score, peak flow, or respiratory rate. Subcutaneous, long-acting epinephrine provides no additional benefit to a beta-2 agonist by nebulization for children with Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Racial inequalities in childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Mortality and hospital admission rates for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP are higher in Maoris and Pacific Islander children than in European children. These ethnic differences are not explained by ethnic differences in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP prevalence, the characteristics of the disease or admission criteria. There are major ethnic differences in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP drug management both in the community and at the time of discharge from hospital. In particular Polynesians were less likely to receive prophylactic therapy and this factor probably accounts for ethnic differences in mortality and admission rates. Possible explanations for the ethnic differences in medical management are discussed.

Relation between Nocturnal_HP symptoms and changes in lung function on lying down in asthmatic children.Nocturnal_HP symptoms are common in young asthmatic children. Such symptoms may be caused by increased impairment of lung function when they adopt the supine posture. Thirty one children aged 2.8-8.3 years were studied, of whom 20 had Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (10 with Frequent_HP Nocturnal_HP symptoms) and 11 had no respiratory problems (control subjects). Peak expiratory flow (PEF) was measured with a Wright's peak flow meter and functional residual capacity (FRC) by a helium gas dilution technique after 30 minutes of lying supine; the values were compared with FRC measured sitting and PEF standing. Peak flow fell significantly on adoption of the supine posture in the asthmatic children, but there was no difference in this fall between the asthmatic children with and without Nocturnal_HP symptoms. FRC also fell on adoption of the supine posture, but the decrease in FRC was significant only in the control children and the asthmatic children without Nocturnal_HP symptoms. The failure to find a greater fall in PEF or a greater change in FRC on adoption of the supine posture among asthmatic children with Nocturnal_HP symptoms suggests that mechanisms other than increased impairment of lung function are responsible for Nocturnal_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Rational drug strategy in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The emphasis in the treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP has shifted from that of bronchial hyper-responsiveness to that of airway inflammation. Bronchodilators still form the mainstay of treatment for all categories of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. However, only anti-allergic drugs and corticosteroids can modify inflammation and long-term usage offers the hope of suppression of the disease and prevention of Progressive_HP airway obstruction. The safety of inhaled steroids has enabled specific treatment to be extended to milder Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Correct treatment will not succeed without patient compliance and good inhaler technique. The ultimate aim of therapy is the reduction of morbidity and mortality and the prevention of irreversible airway obstruction.

[Immunoglobulin levels, number of eosinophils in the Peripheral_HP blood and bronchial hypersensitivity in children with Mycoplasma Pneumonia_HPe Pneumonia_HP].We studied the immunoglobulin levels and the number of eosinophils in the Peripheral_HP blood during the course of Mycoplasma Pneumonia_HPe Pneumonia_HP in children. Nineteen children with Mycoplasma Pneumonia_HPe Pneumonia_HP, including eight asthmatic children, were the study subjects. In eight of them, bronchial hypersensitivity was also measured by the Astograph method in both the convalescent phase and the healing (non-symptomatic) phase. The results were as follows. 1) Total serum IgA and IgM increased in the convalescent phase. 2) The levels of total serum IgE were higher in the Acute_HP phase and then decreased gradually. 3) The number of eosinophils in the Peripheral_HP blood increased over the Acute_HP-to-convalescent phase. 4) Bronchial hypersensitivity increased after Mycoplasma Pneumonia_HPe Pneumonia_HP, and two asthmatic children who exhibited bronchial hypersensitivity had asthmatic attacks. 5) Bronchial hypersensitivity persisted for over one month in two non-asthmatic children.

[Rabbit immunization to induce experimental Asthma_ASDPTO_HP--relationship between antigens and airway reactivity].Japanese white rabbits were immunized with either alternaria or ragweed starting at birth to induce experimental asthmatic model. We studied the characteristics of contractile responses of tracheal smooth muscle isolated from these sensitized animals and compared them with non-sensitized control animals. Both sensitivity and reactivity of contraction induced by acetylcholine (ACh) were increased in the alternaria sensitized group, but only sensitivity was increased in the ragweed group. Contractile responses to electrical field stimulation were enhanced in both sensitized groups, and responses in the alternaria group were significantly greater than those in the ragweed group. In the alternaria group, atropine suppressed the contractile response to KCl, indicating that the contraction was mediated partially through a muscarinic mechanism. In the ragweed group, atropine suppressed responses to 20 mM KCl. Stimulation of the intramural nerve plexus facilitated the release of neurotransmitters, especially ACh. This was more obvious in the alternaria group than in the ragweed group. These results suggest that alternaria sensitization of rabbits produces a better model for studying changes in interaction between nerves and smooth muscle in the airway.

[Immunochemical quantification of the airborne chironomid allergens].We collected airborne particles in the air using a high-volume air sampler, and measured chironomid allergen in the air-filter extract by use of RAST inhibition assay. The results obtained were as follows: 1) The assay revealed the presence of chironomid allergen in the air varying from 6.8 to less than 0.3 ng/m3. 2) In Toyama, seasonal fluctuations of airborne chironomid allergen demonstrated some large peaks in summer (June to August), and showed a tendency to decrease in winter. 3) There were significant correlations between airborne chironomid allergen and dry weight of chironomid midges, collected by using light traps, in all period of a week just before, 1 to 2 weeks before, 2 to 3 weeks before, or 3 to 4 weeks before air sampling. There were not significant correlations between airborne chironomid allergen and weathers (temperature, wind speed and precipitation) during or just before air sampling. 4) In Toyama, the Frequency_HP of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attacks in the asthmatic children with positive C.p. RAST was much increased in summer compared with that of the negative, in which the amount of airborne chironomid allergen was increased. These results show that there is large amount of chironomid allergen in the air from spring to autumn, especially large in summer, and it is related for some asthmatics to the increase of the Frequency_HP of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attack.

Repeated provocation tests in asthmatic children for testing tachyphylaxis to histamine.Tachyphylaxis to histamine was investigated in 16 children, aged 7-15 years, with Mild_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Three consecutive histamine challenges were performed at intervals of 24 hours and 1 hour, respectively. No significant differences in IVC, FEV1, and PC20-histamine values between the three measurements were observed. After a 24 hour interval there was no difference in percentage fall of FEV1, but there was a slight (not significant) decrease in fall of FEV1 after a 1 hour interval. The PC20-histamine values showed good reproducibility with a 24 hour as well as with a 1-hour period between the tests (geometric mean PC20, 2.04 mg/mL +/- 3.50 %SD, 1.96 mg/mL +/- 4.37 %SD, 2.17 mg/mL +/- 4.12 %SD; correlation coefficients for a 24 hour interval, r = 0.87 and for a one-hour interval, r = 0.94 (P less than 0.01]. We conclude that in children there is no strong evidence for tachyphylaxis to histamine. Our results differ from studies on tachyphylaxis in adult asthmatics. Possibly different mechanisms exist in children and in adults.

Acute_HP effect of passive Smoking_ASDPTO on lung function and airway responsiveness in Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic children.The effect of a 1-hour exposure at rest during passive cigarette Smoking_ASDPTO (20 ppm CO) or Sham was investigated in 11 children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (age range, 8-13 yr; ten boys, one girl). Nine of the subjects were on regular therapy with inhaled beta 2-agonists and disodium cromoglycate. Both drugs were withheld at least 6 hours prior to each study session. Exposure was performed in an environmental chamber. Before and immediately after exposure, lung function and symptom scores were determined. After exposure, a histamine inhalation challenge was performed to determine the concentrations that caused a 100% increase in SRaw (PC100SRaw) and a 20% fall in FEV1, (PC20FEV1). Mean (SD) SRaw before and after Sham was 8.7 (3.6) and 9.0 (3.2) cmH2O.s, and mean FEV1 (SD) was 1.97 (0.32) and 1.98 (0.40) L, respectively. Before and after cigarette Smoking_ASDPTO, mean SRaw (SD) was 10.4 (5.3) and 9.4 (3.3) cmH2O.s, and mean FEV1 (SD) was 1.95 (0.37) and 1.94 (0.35 L, respectively. Geometric mean (SD) PC100 SRaw and PC20FEV1 after Sham was 1.39 (3.0) and 0.70 (2.7) mg/mL, and after passive Smoking_ASDPTO 1.65 (2.5) and 0.96 (2.3) mg/mL, respectively. There were no statistical differences in lung function and PC values between Sham and passive cigarette Smoking_ASDPTO. The main symptoms during passive Smoking_ASDPTO were irritation of the eye and the nasopharynx. Our observations suggest that in children with Mild_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP 1 hour of passive cigarette Smoking_ASDPTO does not cause consistent changes of lung function and bronchial responsiveness.

Can Asthma_ASDPTO_HP be cured?1. There is much evidence that many asthmatics lose their symptoms for long periods and are in this sense 'cured'. 2. The factors leading to restitution of normally reactive Healthy_HP airways are multiple and only partially understood. 3. Attempts at cure are likely to require a multi-faceted approach where inducers and sensitizers of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP are reduced as far as possible at the same time as stimulating biological factors whose function is to preserve normal patho-physiology of the airways. 4. Identification of these controlling factors requires intensive study using naturally occurring models of individuals who have and have not gone into remission. 5. Whether anti-Asthma_ASDPTO_HP medication will help usefully in redressing the balance or whether by inhibiting the stimulus for the production of inherent biological controlling factors, they actually mitigate against persisting remission (i.e. 'cure') needs urgent study. Such a possibility might account for some of the remarkable inconsistencies in epidemiological studies currently being reported. In particular, while Medications_ASDPTO for the control of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP have improved dramatically over the last twenty years, the prevalence and perhaps mortality rates from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP are actually rising. However until evidence is much firmer, the dangers of undertreating Asthma_ASDPTO_HP must be recognized.

Refractoriness for ultrasonically nebulized distilled water and histamine after histamine challenge.Refractoriness for bronchial provocation frequently occurs after different challenge tests used to assess bronchial hyperresponsiveness in asthmatic patients. We investigated whether histamine inhalation could cause refractoriness for bronchoconstriction induced by ultrasonically nebulized distilled water (UNDW) and whether histamine causes tachyphylaxis for a subsequent histamine challenge in nine Stable_HP asthmatic patients. Preinhalation of histamine induced a significant diminished bronchoconstrictor response to UNDW cumulative dose of inhaled UNDW causing a 20% fall in forced expired volume in 1 s. The mean increased from 3.5 +/- 0.8 to 11.8 +/- 2.6 (SE) ml after histamine challenge (P less than 0.01). However, repeated inhalation of histamine did not change the bronchoconstrictor response to histamine within 1 h after rechallenge (P greater than 0.5). The magnitude of refractoriness for UNDW inhalation after preinhalation of histamine was correlated to the bronchoconstrictor response to histamine (r = 0.73, P less than 0.05). We conclude that inhaled histamine can induce refractoriness for UNDW, which seems to be related to the degree of bronchial hyperresponsiveness.

[Relation between extent of bronchial reactivity and need for medication (therapy) in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in children].In 42 schoolchildren we have prospectively examined the relationship between the degree of bronchial responsiveness to methacholine and the treatment to control Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Following a standardized protocol for methacholine provocations we determined the provocation concentration causing a fall in FEV1 of 20% (PC20). Patients were grouped into 1 (n = 13), those who required no medication; 2 (n = 8), those who required beta 2-agonists on demand and 3, those who required beta 2-agonists and additional DSCG or topic steroids. Mean PC20 in group 1 was 3.55 mg/ml, in group 2 1.38 mg/ml and in group 3 0.37 mg/ml. There was a significant difference between each group. Generally spoken, those patients showing a high level of bronchial responsiveness to methacholine required more Medications_ASDPTO to control their Asthma_ASDPTO_HP symptoms. However, an overlap of responsiveness in each treatment group was noted. The results of the present study show that measurement of airway responsiveness may be useful in some patients to better assess the necessary treatment to control Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

The results of the present study show that measurement of airway responsiveness may be useful in some patients to better assess the necessary treatment to control asthma.
Pulmonary reflexes after human heart-lung transplantation.Heart-lung transplantation involves denervation of the lungs below the tracheal anastomosis, with associated permanent loss of all pulmonary innervation except post-ganglionic efferent nerves. This is supported by loss of the Cough_HP reflex to inhaled USNDW, which also implies that the RARs which mediate this Cough_HP mechanism lie in the Central_HP airways. Bronchoconstriction following inhalation of USNDW developed only in those HLT recipients with Acute_HP lung rejection; this was not related to methacholine responsiveness and may therefore represent a pathologic vascular response. Hyperresponsiveness to methacholine has been reported following HLT, which we found unrelated to inflammation or Acute_HP rejection. A similar hyperresponsiveness to histamine was seen, which correlated with the response to methacholine. This also implies that histamine may act directly on smooth muscle receptors, and not solely via a cholinergic reflex. Hyperresponsiveness following HLT may be due to development of a Generalized_HP denervation hypersensitivity. Bronchodilation following capsaicin inhalation has been observed in HLT recipients, and may be due to unopposed release of VIP from retained post-ganglionic efferent nerves.

The effect of unproductive Cough_HP/FET on regional mucus movement in the human lungs.The study was designed to ascertain the movement of mucus from Proximal_HP and Peripheral_HP regions within the human lungs during Cough_HP and the forced expiration technique (FET). Mucus movement was measured using a radioaerosol technique. Seven patients (mean +/- SEM age: 63 +/- 3 years) with airways obstruction (% predicted FEV1: 44 +/- 4) participated in the study. Each patient underwent three assessments in a randomized manner: control/Cough_HP/FET. Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) was measured at the mouth during Cough_HP and FET. None of the patients produced sputum during the assessment periods. Both Cough_HP and FET compared with control increased, on average, mucus clearance from all regions; statistical significance was achieved only for Central_HP lung regions with Cough_HP (P less than 0.05). There was no significant correlation between PEFR during Cough_HP/FET and regional lung clearance.

Cough_HP can relieve or exacerbate symptoms in asthmatic patients.From about 1190 to the present day opposing views have been expressed about the effects of Cough_HP in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Some accounts have stated that it brought relief and others that it exacerbated Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, whereas others thought that it could have both effects. In the present investigation, 187 patients with a clinical Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were asked whether Cough_HP relieved or exacerbated their Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. In 41.7% Cough_HP caused exacerbation, in 29.9% it brought relief, in 9.9% it had no effect, and in the remaining 18.7% it sometimes exacerbated their symptoms and sometimes brought relief. When Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was exacerbated, the most common symptom induced was breathlessness, and then Wheezing_HP; Chest_tightness_HP was the least Frequent_HP. When Cough_HP brought relief it was mainly through the expectoration of sputum. However, a small proportion of patients found relief even if there was no expectoration. If Cough_HP exacerbates Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and persists in the face of treatment with standard medication, then treatment specifically directed at its diminution could reduce morbity considerably.

[Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and kitchen salt].Epidemiological studies show considerable geographic differences in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP prevalence and mortality. The regions with high prevalence and mortality are countries with Western-type culture and a high degree of technological progress. They differ from less technically developed countries in a number of ways, including their higher salt intake. Air pollution is often given as the cause of the high prevalence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in the industrialized countries. Against this, it must be pointed out that in the urban agglomerations of the developing countries and in rural areas where heating is by means of open fireplaces (indoor pollution), there is also considerable air pollution. Migration studies from New Zealand and South Africa, where Asthma_ASDPTO_HP prevalence increases parallel to salt intake, provide evidence that other factors arising from westernization and urbanization play a role. In the industrialized countries England and USA there is also a clear connection between salt intake and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP: the greater the salt consumption, the higher the Asthma_ASDPTO_HP prevalence and mortality. On the basis of these observations, the following questions were investigated: (1.) Does salt loading worsen the clinical and functional findings in Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics? (2.) Is the sodium or the chloride in salt the more important? To answer these questions, the effect of salt loading (+6.1 +/- 2.8 g NaCl/d = 105 +/- 48 mmol Na), salt restriction, and loading with sodium citrate in equimolar concentrations (+140 +/- 40 ml Shohl's solution = 120 +/- 34 mmol Na) was investigated in 14 Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics in a controlled crossover study. Statistical analysis showed that salt intake worsened symptoms (p = 0.06) and increased the use of inhaled steroids (p less than or equal to 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Adrenal function in Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic children treated with inhaled budesonide.The effect of the inhaled topical steroid budesonide on adrenal function was evaluated in 33 children (aged 7-15 years) with Moderate_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The trial was designed as a prospective single-blind study of the effect of budesonide in daily doses of 200 microgram through 400 microgram to 800 micrograms in three randomized consecutive periods of 8 weeks. The unstimulated Diurnal_HP production of cortisol was assessed by measurement of free cortisol in 24-hour urine samples at the end of each period. No significant dose-related suppression was found. The cortisol production did not differ significantly during treatment with 800 microgram budesonide as compared to treatment with 200 microgram budesonide (95% confidence interval: 74%-112%). It is concluded, that budesonide is a topical steroid with a favourable ratio between topical and systemic effects in Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic children.

Measurement of leukotriene C4 and D4 in arterial blood of asthmatic patients during remission.We measured the amounts of leukotriene C4 and D4 in the arterial blood of asthmatic patients during remission and compared these with the amounts of leukotrienes in the arterial blood of asthmatic patients during Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, which had been reported in our previous study. Leukotriene C4 and D4 was detected in five patients during remission at 50.68 +/- 8.28 and 36.68 +/- 17.31 pg/mL (mean +/- SD), respectively. In five control subjects, the amounts of leukotriene C4 and D4 were 78.22 +/- 34.65 and 55.06 +/- 13.54 pg/mL (mean +/- SD), respectively. As cited in our previous report, the amounts of leukotriene C4 and D4 in arterial blood of asthmatic patients during Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were 523.33 +/- 737.06 and 495 +/- 304.48 pg/mL. Hence, there were no significant differences in the leukotriene C4 and D4 values between asthmatic patients during remission and control subjects, whereas there was a significant difference in the leukotriene D4 values between asthmatic patients during Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and, asthmatic patients during remission or control subjects (P less than .01). In addition, the leukotriene C4 values in asthmatic patients during Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were larger than in asthmatic patients during remission or control subjects without a significant difference. The amounts of leukotriene C4 and D4 in arterial blood of asthmatic patients may reflect the degree of Severity_HP of Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Pharmacist advice to asthmatics regarding antihistamine use.Due to the Frequency_HP of asthmatics having concurrent allergic symptoms, patients may seek relief from antihistamines, which are currently labeled with warnings against their use in asthmatics. A survey was conducted in the Chicago area to evaluate the advice rendered by pharmacists regarding the use of antihistamines in asthmatics and their opinions about the current product labeling. Thirty percent of the surveys were returned. Nearly half (48%) of the surveyed pharmacists advise their asthmatic customers to avoid antihistamines and 75% of this group recommend avoidance because they believe antihistamines worsen asthmatic symptoms, despite the lack of sufficient clinical data to support this concern. Only 17% of pharmacists advise that antihistamines pose no problems for asthmatics. The latter group is the most aware that there is controversy surrounding the current labeling. Overall, half the pharmacists surveyed believe the current labeling is not appropriate for patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Until the labeling is revised, physicians should be aware that pharmacists may advise their asthmatics against using antihistamines even though antihistamines should be only contraindicated in cases of proven adverse reactions.

Association between corticosteroids and psychologic change in hospitalized asthmatic children.Thirty-two children (mean age 14 years) with Chronic_HP, Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were evaluated through the course of short-term prednisone "burst" treatment. At high steroid day (mean dose = 61.4 mg), the children reported more symptoms of Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP and Depression_ASDPTO and demonstrated diminished verbal memory relative to low steroid day (mean dose = 6.97 mg). Order effects (evaluation at high steroid day first versus low steroid day first) were not significant for these steroid-sensitive variables. No dose-related changes emerged on measures of Hyperactivity_HP, attention, Impulsivity_HP, or fine motor control. Five subject variables were examined as potential risk factors. No association emerged between psychologic change scores and age, socioeconomic status, IQ, or Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Severity_HP. Significant findings indicated that, as children increasingly demonstrated emotional difficulty or were from dysfunctional families, they were more likely to experience negative psychologic changes associated with high-dose steroids.

Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and airway hyperresponsiveness.Airway hyperresponsiveness to a large number of stimuli is a characteristic of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in humans. Various components of the tracheobronchial tree might contribute to this characteristic, such as smooth muscle, the bronchial epithelium, various neurohumoral mechanisms, and the mechanical linkages between the lung parenchyma and the airways. The degree of responsiveness can be further increased by a series of stimuli associated with inflammation in the periphery of the lung. Such stimuli actually induce an asthmatic state or heighten the vulnerability of asthmatics, making them more prone to overt attacks in response to minor stimuli that would ordinarily be well tolerated. Depending upon the inciting stimulus, different cells and mediators may be playing a role in producing and perpetuating the inflammatory state and producing further increases in responsiveness.

Medical and surgical treatment of nonallergic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP associated with Gastroesophageal_reflux_HP.Patients presenting to a chest clinic because of adult-Onset_HP Wheezing_HP with no history of Allergy_HP had a 90 percent prevalence of Gastroesophageal_reflux_HP, even though reflux symptoms were Mild_HP or absent. Ninety patients were randomly assigned to receive cimetidine or an identical placebo or to undergo antireflux surgery. During a six-month period, all groups improved clinically; the cimetidine and surgical groups improved more than the placebo group. The intake of pulmonary medication decreased significantly in both cimetidine and surgical groups. Pulmonary function test results improved in the cimetidine- and surgically treated patients; improvement was not statistically significant. At long-term follow-up, the surgical group maintained clinical improvement and decreased pulmonary medication intake, whereas the placebo group worsened. We conclude that Gastroesophageal_reflux_HP can play a significant role in some patients with nonallergic pulmonary disease and that its treatment can improve pulmonary symptoms and objective measurements of pulmonary function.

The effect of maximal doses of formoterol and salbutamol from a metered dose inhaler on pulse rates, ECG, and serum potassium concentrations.In a randomized, double-blind, crossover cumulative study, the individual maximal bronchodilator dosages for formoterol (F) and salbutamol (S) were assessed for their respective influence on ECG, pulse rate, and serum potassium levels in 13 patients with Stable_HP and reversible Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The following dosages were administered with an interval of 1 h: 12-24-48-(48)-(48) micrograms for F and 100-200-400-400-(400)-(400) micrograms for S. The study day was discontinued if pulse rate was above 140 beats min-1, a flattening of T wave on the ECG was recorded, or a maximal bronchodilation in FEV1 was observed (above 110 percent of the predicted value or an increase in FEV1 in the last two measurements below 5 percent). The maximal individual dose of F administered was 84 micrograms in six patients, 132 micrograms in three patients, 180 micrograms in three patients, and 228 micrograms in one patient. For S, the maximal individual dose was 400 micrograms in three patients, 2,200 micrograms in eight patients, 3,000 micrograms in one patient, and 3,800 micrograms in one patient. The mean maximal increase in FEV1 was 36.0 percent after F and 35.1 percent after S. Pulse rate increased from 73 to S3 beats.min-1 after F and from 75 to 84 beats.min-1 after S (both statistically significant). No pulse rate above 140 beats.min-1 was observed. In the high-therapeutic range (up to 36 micrograms of F and 6,090 micrograms of S), no changes in potassium level were observed. In still higher dosages, mean potassium level decreased from 4.16 to 3.78 mmol.L-1 after F and from 4.02 to 3.88 mmol.L-1 after S (not clinically relevant). The lowest individual potassium level recorded was 3.1 mmol.L-1. No clinically important changes in ECG were observed. In conclusion, very high doses of F and S administered from a metered dose inhaler proved to be safe for patients.

Asthma_ASDPTO_HP deaths.Deaths from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP seem to be increasing in spite of considerable improvements in drug treatment and management plans. There are many hypotheses to explain this, but little emphasis has been placed on the possibility that confidence in better drug treatments may modify patients' behavior so as to place them at greater risk of illness. It is well recognized that excessive confidence in bronchodilator inhalers and nebulizers can make patients stay away from hospitals too long during Acute_HP attacks. It is also very possible that prevention of symptoms by use of antiAsthma_ASDPTO_HP drugs could allow patients to spend more time in environments containing antigens or other agents that provoke Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, resulting in more serious and long-lasting bronchial inflammation and reactivity.

Prolonged_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP after smoke inhalation: a report of three cases and a review of previous reports.The development of Prolonged_HP obstructive airways disease after smoke inhalation is of concern to fire victims and fire fighters. Three cases of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP that developed following the inhalation of pyrolysis products are presented along with a review of previous reports of airway injury from smoke inhalation. Polyvinyl chloride pyrolysis products seem to pose a high risk, but other toxic inhalants are also implicated. There is substantial evidence that Prolonged_HP airway hyper-responsiveness and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP may follow numerous inflammatory insults including smoke inhalation. Studies to identify specific individual risk factors and Asthma_ASDPTO_HPgenic pyrolysis products are needed. Early, postexposure anti-inflammatory treatment may modify the outcome.

[Deficits in school performance in children and adolescents with Chronic_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].At the time of their admission to the Buchenhöhe Jugendorf Asthma_ASDPTO_HP centre (an institution for medical, professional and social rehabilitation), an investigation was made into the cases of 186 children and youths (average age: 14.0), the majority of whom suffered from Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The investigation, focused on the patients' ailment symptomatology and its effect on school progress, showed that one third of the children had spent considerable time hospitalized in intensive care (an average of 4.4 x). Amongst other findings were: That one third on the children and youths had not taken part in sports, either at school or in their leisure time, that they had missed a lot of school (33 children had missed over 30%) and that the children and youths were an average of 1.29 years behind the normal school level. The investigation leads to the conclusion that the schooling situation of asthmatic children and youths should be taken into consideration within the Chronic_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP treatment plan and that treatment periods that last too long bring about an irreversible school deficiency which could hinder the further development of the youth.

[Trends in the Frequency_HP of hospitalization for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Chronic_HP Obstructive_lung_disease_HP in The Netherlands, 1980-1988].National hospital admission frequencies were analysed for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (ICD-9 code 493) and Chronic_HP obstructive pulmonary disease (Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP) (ICD-code 490 + 491 + 492 + 496) for 1980-1988 by sex and according to age (0-4, 5-34, 35-64, and greater than or equal to 65 years). Rates per million of the population per year were calculated and time trend analyses performed by least square regression. The admission rate for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP showed a decrease in the total male and female population, as was the case in all age groups, except for the age group 0-4 years in which a significant increase was found. For Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP an increase was observed in total admissions in males and females, due to a substantial increase in the age group greater than or equal to 65 years, while in females the increase in the age group 35-64 years also contributed. The striking increase in hospitalisation for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in young children needs further attention, as does the increase in hospital admissions for Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP in older people, particularly with respect to women, for whom continuing rising trends can be expected.
[Trends in the frequency of hospitalization for asthma and chronic obstructive lung disease in The Netherlands, 1980-1988].National hospital admission frequencies were analysed for asthma (ICD-9 code 493) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (ICD-code 490 + 491 + 492 + 496) for 1980-1988 by sex and according to age (0-4, 5-34, 35-64, and greater than or equal to 65 years).

Theophylline and Status_epilepticus_HP in children.We studied the role of theophylline on outcome of Status_epilepticus_HP (SE) in children. During a two-year-period, 16 of 114 episodes of SE occurred in children receiving theophylline. At the Onset_HP of SE, theophylline blood levels were elevated in 8 episodes, and were therapeutic or subtherapeutic in 8 episodes. In the 8 episodes of SE with elevated theophylline levels, one child died and three suffered permanent new neurologic deficits. In the 8 episodes of SE with normal or low theophylline levels, only one child had a Transient_HP deficit. The occurrence of death or disability in 4 of 8 episodes of SE with elevated theophylline was considerably higher than the 23% incidence of death or persistent CNS deficit in the overall series of 114 episodes of SE. We conclude that theophylline, at toxic levels, is a significant factor in increased morbidity. We suspect that the hypoxia from the respiratory disorder for which theophylline was used, and the reduced cerebral blood flow known to occur with theophylline led to a failure to compensate for the increased cerebral metabolic rate of SE, thus increasing the risk of a poor outcome.

Histamine hyperresponsiveness of the extrathoracic airway in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic symptoms.Functional abnormalities of the extrathoracic airway (EA) may produce symptoms mimicking Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. We assessed the bronchial (B) and EA responsiveness to inhaled histamine in 40 patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic symptoms and in nine asymptomatic controls. FEV1 and maximal mid-inspiratory flow (MIF50) were used as index of bronchial and EA narrowing. Hyperresponsiveness of the intra-(BHR) or extra-(EA-HR) thoracic airway was diagnosed when the provocative concentrations of histamine (PC20FEV1 or PC25MIF50) were less than 8 mg/ml. Fiberoptic laryngoscopy was performed in nine patients and three controls. The glottal region was measured at mid-volume of maximal inspiration (AgMI) and expiration (AgME) before and after histamine. Predominant EA-HR was found in 13 patients, predominant BHR in 12, equivalent BHR and EA-HR in another 12; no significant airway narrowing was observed in three patients and in the nine controls. EA-HR was significantly associated with female sex, Sinusitis_HP, post-nasal drip, Dysphonia_HP; BHR with atopy, Wheezing_HP and lower MEF50. The percent change in AgMI after histamine was closely related to the PC25MIF50 (r = 0.87, P less than 0.001), that of AgME to the PC20FEV1 (r = 0.78, P less than 0.01). These findings suggest that the assessment of EA responsiveness may be useful in the evaluation of Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic symptoms, especially in patients with no BHR.

Use of the extended Phadebas RAST panel in the Diagnosis_ASDPTO of mould Allergy_HP in asthmatic children.The clinical significance of mould allergens in Phadebas RAST panel was investigated in 121 asthmatic children. They were selected from a total population of 1649 patients. The patients were distributed into four groups, based on the combination of positive or negative skin prick tests (SPT) together with symptoms suggestive or not of mould sensitivity. Mould-specific IgE antibodies were investigated using the original RAST panel (Alternaria, Aspergillus, Candida, Cladosporium, Mucor and Penicillium) and a set of 10 additional mould-allergen discs (Aureobasidium, Botrytis, Curvularia, Epicoccum, Fusarium, Helminthosporium, Phoma, Rhizopus, Stemphylium and Trichoderma). The set of additional RAST discs revealed patients with mould-reaginic antibodies not found with the original RAST panel. This occurred in four of 49 (8.2%) RAST positive (class greater than or equal to 2) patients. The allergens most frequently positive were Cladosporium (in 28% of the patients), Candida (28%) and Helminthosporium (26%). A remarkable degree of simultaneous reactivity to almost all moulds tested was observed. Patients with multiple (greater than or equal to 7) mould sensitization were effectively pinpointed using any duplicate combination of Aureobasidium, Botrytis, Candida, Cladosporium, Helminthosporium, Penicillium and Stemphylium.

Airway response to exercise and methacholine in children with respiratory symptoms.Thirty atopic and 30 non-atopic subjects were identified from a population of 7-8 year old children with current respiratory symptoms. The response of the airways to exercise and provocation by methacholine were compared. In these children, who had symptoms but were not necessarily asthmatic, there was no significant correlation between the two stimuli. The atopic children were, however, significantly more responsive than the non-atopic children to both. For the whole group, odds ratios derived for atopy and for an increased response to methacholine (expressed as a PD20--the dose that caused the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) to fall by 20%--of less than 6.4 mumol/l), a positive exercise test (greater than 15% fall in FEV1), and the presence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were 13.5, 3.3, and 21.0, respectively; that for positive response to methacholine and positive exercise challenge was 1.5. Thus though increased bronchial responsiveness to methacholine and exercise challenge are both associated with a Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, the association between the two stimuli is complex, and supports the view that they reflect entirely different components of airways dysfunction.

Is Small_for_gestational_age_HP a risk factor for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP during adolescence?The effect of Small_for_gestational_age_HP on the incidence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP by 17 years of age was investigated by studying medical draft examination records of 20,312 male subjects born in Jerusalem between January 1967 and December 1971. Additional information on birth weight and other demographic factors was abstracted from the Jerusalem Perinatal Study computerised database. A stepwise multiple logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios for developing Asthma_ASDPTO_HP by 17 years of age in 500 g birthweight categories from less than 2000 g to 4500 g. The odds ratios were adjusted for the confounding effects of ethnic origin, social class (determined by area of residence), paternal education, maternal age, and birth order. The group with Small_for_gestational_age_HPs (less than 2500 g, n = 1004) had a significantly increased risk of developing Asthma_ASDPTO_HP by 17 years of age, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.44 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 2.66) for birthweight group less than 2000 g and 1.49 (95% CI 1.05 to 2.12) for birthweight group 2000-2499 g compared with the reference group of 3000-3499 g. We conclude that infants with birth weights of less than 2500 g may have a higher risk of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP during childhood and adolescence than infants who were heavier at birth.

Delay in Diagnosis_ASDPTO of childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and its influence on respiratory consultation rates.A survey of cases of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in two general practices with a special interest in the disease identified 212 asthmatic children aged 0-16 years by the end of January 1989 who had been registered in that practice since birth. Delay in Diagnosis_ASDPTO, both in terms of time (median 2.95 years) and number of consultations (median 7), was considerable. Annual rates of consultations for respiratory symptoms that were initiated by the patients fell significantly after Diagnosis_ASDPTO (median before = 1.80, after = 0.95 consultations/year), but the number initiated by the doctors rose significantly (median before = 0, after = 1.01 consultations/year). The overall rates before and after Diagnosis_ASDPTO were not significantly different (median before = 2.04, after = 2.21 consultations/year). Increased efforts are required to reduce this delay thereby minimising the morbidity of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in childhood.

Occupational respiratory disease in the United Kingdom 1989: a report to the British Thoracic Society and the Society of Occupational Medicine by the SWORD project group.A voluntary scheme for the surveillance of work related and occupational respiratory disease (SWORD) was established in January 1989 with help from the British Thoracic Society and the Society of Occupational Medicine and support from the Health and Safety Executive. Three hundred and fifty four chest physicians representing 90% of the chest clinics in the United Kingdom and 361 occupational physicians submit reports regularly of newly diagnosed cases of work related respiratory illness with information on age, sex, residence, occupation, and suspected causal agent. In 1989 2101 cases were notified, of which Frequent_HP diagnoses were Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (26%), mesothelioma (16%), pneumoconiosis (15%), benign pleural disease (11%), and allergic alveolitis (6%). Incidence rates calculated against denominators from the Labour Force Survey showed very large differences between occupational groups, especially for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and asbestos related diseases. Substantial regional variation in the incidence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was not explained by the geographical distribution of high risk industries and was probably due to differing levels of ascertainment. The results imply that the true Frequency_HP of Acute_HP occupational respiratory disease in the United Kingdom may have been three times greater than that reported.

Factors relating to the development of respiratory symptoms in coffee process workers.After several cases of occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP had been reported in a coffee processing factory in England, 197 coffee workers representing 80% of the production workforce were studied to determine the factors affecting the development of work related respiratory symptoms of wheeze, Cough_HP, and dyspnoea. Two computer administered questionnaires concerning the presence of respiratory symptoms and the occurrence of work related respiratory symptoms were used. Workers underwent skin prick testing to green coffee bean extract (GCB) and 11 common inhalant allergen extracts and bronchial provocation testing with methacholine. The presence of specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to GCB and castor bean extract (CAB) were determined by a radioallergosorbent test (RAST). The prevalence of work related respiratory symptoms was 12.7%, bronchial hyperresponsiveness 30%, atopy 54%, positive GCB skin prick test 14.7%, positive GCB RAST 14%, and positive CAB RAST 14.7%. None of the workers was sensitised to fungi present in the factory and the numbers of certain species of fungi, despite being greater than may be found out of doors or in an uncontaminated indoor environment, were fewer than are generally associated with the presence of work related respiratory symptoms among agricultural workers. Storage mites were not isolated. Green coffee bean extract and CAB RAST were significantly correlated using the McNemar test but there was limited allergenic cross reactivity in RAST inhibition studies of the two extracts. The only factors that were significantly and independently associated with work related symptoms were CAB RAST and duration of employment. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness was not independently associated with work related respiratory symptoms. The significant independent associations of bronchial hyperresponsiveness included GCB RAST, duration of employment, and resting forced expiratory volume in one second. Exposure to CAB, a highly potent antigen, may be overriding the effects of other factors such a GCB, atopy, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and Smoking_ASDPTO. This study suggests that CAB contamination remains a potential problem in the coffee processing industry and all efforts to eliminate it from the working environment should continue.

Occupation and Smoking_ASDPTO adjusted mortality due to Asthma_ASDPTO_HP among Swedish men.The study aims to survey the mortality from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in different occupations among Swedish men. The design was a register based cohort study where the Smoking_ASDPTO adjusted mortality due to Asthma_ASDPTO_HP among Swedish men 1971-80 was investigated. For each occupation a Smoking_ASDPTO adjusted standardised mortality ratio (SMR) was calculated based on a linkage between official mortality statistics 1971-80 and occupational information in the 1970 national census. The information about the Smoking_ASDPTO habits among different occupations was obtained from a Smoking_ASDPTO survey carried out in 1963. In the statistical analysis only occupations with more than 10 deaths were considered. A significantly increased mortality from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was found among farmers (Smoking_ASDPTO adjusted SMR 137, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 115-156), farm workers (Smoking_ASDPTO adjusted SMR 170, 95% CI 107-235), woodworking machine operators (Smoking_ASDPTO adjusted SMR 226, 95% CI 108-344), clerical workers (Smoking_ASDPTO adjusted SMR 161, 95% CI 102-220), packers and labellers (Smoking_ASDPTO adjusted SMR 144, 95% CI 100-188), and watchmen (Smoking_ASDPTO adjusted SMR 212, 95% CI 104-320). Exposure to organic dust, such as fresh wood dust and dusts in the farming environment, may cause increased mortality due to Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Why do they wheeze?The pathogenesis of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP can be divided into clinical, physiological, and anatomical considerations. Clinical features include reversible obstruction, allergens, and other factors such as Gastroesophageal_reflux_HP. Physiological considerations include bronchial hyperreactivity, Abnormality_of_the_nervous_system_HP, nonadrenergic noncholinergic system (NANC), and neuropeptides. Anatomic and cellular considerations include eosinophils, respiratory epithelium, mast cells/basophils, cytokines, and histamine-releasing factors (HRF), and histamine-release inhibitory factor (HRIF).

Why do they wheeze?The pathogenesis of asthma can be divided into clinical, physiological, and anatomical considerations. Clinical features include reversible obstruction, allergens, and other factors such as gastroesophageal reflux. Physiological considerations include bronchial hyperreactivity, neurologic abnormalities, nonadrenergic noncholinergic system (NANC), and neuropeptides. Anatomic and cellular considerations include eosinophils, respiratory epithelium, mast cells/basophils, cytokines, and histamine-releasing factors (HRF), and histamine-release inhibitory factor (HRIF).
How will we treat Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in the year 2000?Expansion of the understanding of the mechanism of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP progressed dramatically in the past decade. With this new information, therapeutic emphasis switched from primarily bronchodilator therapy to anti-inflammatory therapy. Concurrently, drugs with different delivery systems as well as higher dose agents were released, simplifying therapy for many patients. The result is a fairly dramatic reexamination of traditionally used Medications_ASDPTO and attempts to develop newer Medications_ASDPTO aimed at reducing Asthma_ASDPTO_HP based on the newer proposed pathophysiological mechanisms. Future management of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP likely will involve some newer Medications_ASDPTO as well as the education of the patient and his/her family concerning the behavior of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and appropriate steps to take when there is loss of usual Asthma_ASDPTO_HP control.

Aerosol physiology, deposition, and metered dose inhalers.The percentage of the dose reaching the lungs from a pressurized metered dose inhaler (MDI) is likely to be a major determinant of the efficacy of inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids. Yet MDIs may deposit no drug in the lungs in patients with poor inhaler technique and no more than 20% of the dose under optimum conditions. Spacer devices can help to deposit as much drug as from a correctly used MDI (even in patients with poor technique) but are often large and bulky. More compact (and easier to use) pressurized devices and multidose dry powder inhalers will be valuable additions to the range of apparatus available for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP therapy and prophylaxis.

[The clinical benefit of high dose inhalation therapy with beclomethasone dipropionate for patients with Chronic_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].Conventional doses of aerosolized beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) of up to 400 micrograms/day by inhalation has often failed to normalize the pulmonary function of Chronic_HP adult patients. Therefore it may be necessary to administer the individual maximum dose of BDP to reduce bronchial inflammation. In 13 patients (2 males and 11 females, mean age 49.2 +/- 3.7 years old) with Chronic_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP whose minimum %PEFRs were lower than 80% under treatment with conventional doses of BDP, the clinical benefit of high dose inhalation therapy with BDP was studied for four consecutive weeks by comparing % peak expiratory flow rate (%PEFR) measured four times a day both before and 10 minutes after inhaled procaterol (PCR) in a cross-over fashion. Mean morning %PEFRs before inhaled PCR during the first two weeks with a lower dose of BDP (419 +/- 24 micrograms/day) and during the following two weeks with a higher dose of BDP (904 +/- 55 micrograms/day) were 60.6 +/- 3.1% and 77.5 +/- 4.1%, respectively (p less than 0.01). Average increases in %PEFR during the higher dose period before and after inhaled PCR were 12.1% and 12.4%, respectively, which was observed by the end of the first week after the start of higher dose of BDP in 12 out of 13 patients. Since there were no adverse reactions such as Hoarse_voice_HP, oral thrush and candidiasis during the period with higher doses of BDP, it was concluded that we should promptly employ higher doses of BDP in patients who did not respond satisfactorily to conventional doses of BDP.

[Experience with using radionuclide methods for evaluation of the lungs and hepatobiliary system in children with allergic diseases].A total of 25 children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and 40 children with cutaneous and dermato-respiratory + manifestations of Allergy_HP and concomitant injury to the gastrointestinal tract were under observation at an allergological clinic. In addition to the general clinical and allergological examination, radionuclide studies were performed by means of scintipneumography with 99mTc and hepatobiliscintigraphy with 99mTc HIDA. The data obtained indicate that radionuclide methods can be used in childhood allergological practice in the capacity of screening Diagnosis_ASDPTO as well as in the capacity of adjuvant + methods of examination, making it possible to perform investigations necessary for Diagnosis_ASDPTO establishment in a more precise and atraumatic manner.

[Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and mountain air].Geilomo hospital for children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Allergy_HP is situated 800 m above sea level in a non-polluted area in the Central_HP part of Norway. 31 children who were admitted to this hospital from different parts of Norway (mostly from the main cities) were studied for six weeks. They underwent physical training and daily measurements were taken of lung function and the effect of bronchodilators. The bronchial responsiveness of the children improved significantly from week 1 to week 6, as measured by reduction in lung function after sub-maximal running on a treadmill. There was significant improvement in daily symptom score, and in degree of obstruction as shown by physical examination. The children's improvement was probably the result of a stay in a mountainous area with very little air pollution or allergens, combined with regular planned physical activity, and regular medication and surveillance.

[Do we have an Asthma_ASDPTO_HP epidemic?].The number of persons hospitalized for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and mortality from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP have both shown an increasing tendency in many countries over the last few years. In Norway, 1.4% of the respondents in the 1975 Health Survey conducted by the Central_HP Bureau of Statistics claimed to suffer from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The corresponding number in 1985 was 2.4%. The prevalence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was higher among subjects in rural than in urban communities. There are many sources of error linked to the studies discussed in this paper. Nevertheless, there are certain indications of a real increase in the prevalence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, and analytical studies into the possible causes of this disease should be conducted.

Structure activity hypotheses in occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP caused by low molecular weight substances.Many substances with a low molecular weight (less than 1000 molecular weight) but of different chemical classes are recognized as causative agents of occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Some of their major chemical properties are highlighted in relation to their putative interactions with human macromolecules. Thus, certain transition metals which form co-ordination complexes may chelate human proteins. Several organic substances have marked basic properties which are responsible for their chemical reactivity. Some of these, such as the bifunctional bases ethylene diamine, piperazine and para-phenylene diamine are known causative agents of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP while their monofunctional counterparts, in spite of wide industrial application, are not similarly recognized causes. This suggests that the presence of multiple reactive groups is of importance in the molecular interactions with human macromolecules that eventually lead to occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Reference is also made to other substances to exemplify hypothetical mechanisms of these interactions. Such generation of hypotheses is a prelude to quantitative studies of structure activity relationships (QSARs) where the hypotheses can be tested and revised. Structure activity hypotheses in isolation might not be adequate predictors of the risk of occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. However, if applied to novel chemical entities they might eventually prove useful in contributing to the development of policies for prospective health surveillance and in establishing priorities for epidemiological research.

What do medical students know about childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP?A questionnaire designed to measure knowledge about childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was completed by 216 of the 311 (69%) undergraduate medical students at the University of Newcastle. First year students had a mean score of 16.2 (maximum possible score was 31) which was similar to the background community score of 13.0 obtained in a group of parents with no close contact with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Knowledge about Asthma_ASDPTO_HP increased over each of the 5 years of the medical course. Final-year students had a mean score of 28.7 (range: 25-31) which was similar to a group of parents thought by their paediatricians to have a high level of knowledge about Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (mean: 25.3, range: 18-31). The progression of knowledge over the 5 years of the course provided interesting information about the learning process. Although second year students completed the questionnaire after a term devoted to coursework in respiratory medicine, only 26% were able to name two preventive agents and 21% named three agents useful during Acute_HP attacks of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Third year students gave correct responses in 39 and 45% of cases, respectively, and the correct response rates rose to 78 and 97% in the fifth year. This was probably because the theoretical knowledge needed to be acquired and tested against a clinical scenario before it could be used. The study demonstrated an increase in knowledge about Asthma_ASDPTO_HP throughout the problem-based medical course. In addition to providing information about the educational process, it provided information about the questionnaire which was able to measure a range of knowledge and not just extremes of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP knowledge.

Discipline strategies and parental perceptions of preschool children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Parents of 37 children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (aged between three and five years) and of 37 Healthy_HP controls were interviewed about their involvement in everyday care, discipline practices, perceptions of their child and situations which were particularly stressful. There was little correlation between mothers' and fathers' preferences for different discipline practices. There was, however, greater agreement in their perceptions. Parents of children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP did not differ from those of Healthy_HP controls in discipline practices. However, children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were perceived to be generally less Healthy_HP. Parents of those with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP also reported a greater number of everyday situations to be stressful. These data do not support traditional assumptions that parents of children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP are more permissive or overindulgent. At least in this preschool sample, there was only limited indication of adverse effects of Chronic_HP disease on parenting practices.

Selenium status in relation to reduced glutathione peroxidase activity in aspirin-sensitive Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Selenium status and its relationship to lowered platelet glutathione peroxidase activity was investigated in 18 subjects with aspirin (ASA)-induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and in asthmatic and non-asthmatic ASA-tolerant subjects. Mean serum selenium concentration in ASA-tolerant asthmatics (1.25 microns/l; 98.5 micrograms/l) was significantly higher than that in ASA-induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP subjects (1.14 microns/l; 89.7 micrograms/l) and than that in Healthy_HP controls (1.15 microns/l; 91 micrograms/l). Although there was a correlation between serum selenium concentration and platelet glutathione peroxidase activity, enzyme activity was significantly lower in the ASA-induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP group compared to other groups even after correcting for selenium status. These results indicate that lowered platelet glutathione peroxidase activity in ASA-induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is a product of both selenium availability and an unidentified syndrome-specific (possibly genetic) factor.

Selective breeding of two lines of guinea pigs differing in bronchial sensitivity to acetylcholine and histamine exposure.We developed two lines of guinea pigs, one as model animals for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP with bronchial hypersensitivity and the other with hyposensitivity as a control. In the last four years, the bronchial hypersensitive line (BHS) and hyposensitive line (BHR), both derived from Hartley strain guinea pigs, have been selected by using bronchial reactivity to acetylcholine and to histamine as parameters. Both lines have reached the F6 generation. The following results were obtained with the two lines: 1) Sib and cous in matings, and mating of selected consanguineous individuals were adopted in breeding BHS and BHR. The breeding started with six families, each, but in the F6 generation the number of families decreased to two in each line. 2) Appearance rates of hyper- or hyposensitivity to acetylcholine and histamine increased with successive generations in both lines, which had been completely separated by the F6 generation. 3) Coefficients of inbreeding in BHS and BHR in the F6 generation ranged from 42% to 45% in the former and 42% in the latter. 4) Heritabilities (h2) of BHS and BHR for the appearance rates of sensitivity to acetylcholine were presumed to be 0.54 in the former and 0.69 in the latter. 5) No difference in the body weight of 0, 20, and 40 day-old BHS was observed in any generation. On the other hand, the body weight of 20 and 40 day-old BHR tended to decrease with successive generations. 6) Mean litter sizes of BHS and BHR in each of the generations ranged from 2.24 to 3.47 animals in the former and from 2.63 to 3.38 animals in the latter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Influence of demographic and disease related factors on the degree of distress associated with symptoms and restrictions on daily living due to Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in six countries.To investigate the influence of demographic and physiological variables on the degree of distress associated with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, 124 patients were recruited from six countries. All patients responded to 76 items relating to symptoms and impacts of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP on daily living by marking a 10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS) to indicate the degree of distress associated with any particular item. The influence of three factors, age, sex and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), on these VAS scores was investigated. Differences between patients accounted for 13.4% of the total variance (sum of squares) in VAS scores. There were no significant effects of sex, age or FEV1 on VAS score (p greater than 0.05 in each case). The separate proportionate contribution of each of these three factors to the total variance in item scores ranged from 0.02% (FEV1) to 0.2% (sex). There were significant differences between the mean VAS scores from the six countries (p less than 0.01) but these differences contributed to only 3.6% of the total variance in the measured VAS scores. We conclude that demographic and disease related factors account for very little of the differences in the degree of distress that patients attach to the symptoms and effects of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. We suggest that it is possible to make meaningful comparisons between countries of the impact of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP on patients' lives.

Bricanyl Turbuhaler in the treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP: a six week multi-centre study carried out in Sweden, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Norway and Finland.Two hundred and fifty eight adult patients with bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP participated in an open, parallel group study of 8 wks duration. During a 2 wk run-in period the beta 2-agonist terbutaline (0.5 mg q.i.d) was delivered via a pressurized freon aerosol, Bricanyl metered dose inhaler (MDI). During the following 6 wks, one third of the patients continued with MDI and two thirds with the same dose of terbutaline in the form of dry powder, Bricanyl Turbuhaler. There were no statistically significant differences in the increases in peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) after inhalation between the two treatment groups. The Asthma_ASDPTO_HP symptom scores decreased in the Turbuhaler group during the study but remained the same in the MDI group. No difference in use of extra trial medication during the day was found. During the night, the difference was statistically significant in favour of Turbuhaler (p less than 0.05). Turbuhaler was well accepted and easy to use. As compared with the MDI used during run-in, 50% of the patients in the Turbuhaler group preferred to use Turbuhaler and 26% MDI, whilst 24% had no preference. In conclusion, Turbuhaler was at least as effective as MDI during the whole Turbuhaler life-span (6 wks).

Late_Onset_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP?A 77 yr old male was referred for dyspnoea and Recurrent_HP_infections_HP of the lower airways for the previous five months. On the Lateral_HP chest roentgenogram a process in the tracheal area was found, and during bronchoscopy a polypoid Neoplasm_HP was seen about four centimetres above the main carina. It appeared to be a benign endotracheal Neoplasm_HP which was removed after coagulation by a Neodymium yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG) laser.

The social impact of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.While much research has examined the aetiology and treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, little work has been done on its social impact. Yet Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, like any disease, has a social as well as a medical dimension and it is increasingly being recognized that these two dimensions are interlinked. This paper describes a study into the social and personal impact of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP on the lives of sufferers and their families. It shows that people are Affected_HP in many different ways: in employment, schooling, physical activities, social interaction, personal relationships and emotional well-being. All of the people interviewed had experienced some impact on their lives, albeit to varying degrees. The overall social impact was positively correlated with the Severity_HP of the Asthma_ASDPTO_HP itself; this correlation was statistically significant in the case of adults and children under school age.

Asthma_ASDPTO_HP: a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is a disease needing urgent action. Morbidity and mortality are rising, despite advances in our understanding of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and in its treatment. The lifetime prevalence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in children varies from 5 to 31%, depending on the defining criteria, and even when recent prevalence (occurring in the past two years) is examined, rates from 5 to 18% have been found. There is growing evidence which shows that signs of reversible airways disease occur in the elderly with even greater Frequency_HP and it is likely that at least 10% of the population will need Asthma_ASDPTO_HP treatment at some stage of their lives; this means that well over five million people in the UK or 250 patients in each 'average' general practice list of 2500 merit the Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP at some stage of their lives. The fact that an average practice is likely to have diagnosed less than half that number clearly implies that Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is first and foremost an under-diagnosed disease.

The carotid bodies in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.A histological study was made of Right_HP carotid bodies resected therapeutically from 50 patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Also studied as controls were 10 Right_HP carotid bodies from subjects coming to necropsy. Hypoxaemia was considered a contra-indication to glomectomy and only patients with a resting arterial oxygen tension exceeding 65 mm Hg were submitted to operation. It was found that in patients with a short history of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP the carotid bodies were not enlarged, but there was hyperplasia of sustentacular cells. In cases with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP for 5 years or more the sustentacular cell hyperplasia was more pronounced and was associated with many nerve fibrils and slight enlargement of the carotid bodies. The functional significance of the proliferation of sustentacular cells and the abundance of nerve axons is obscure. In the Asthma_ASDPTO_HP cases there was prominence of the dark variant of chief cells, thought to be related to episodes of hypoxaemia.

Occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is becoming an increasingly common problem worldwide. To date however, the impact of this disorder in Ireland has not been evaluated. In this present study we document 39 cases of occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP presenting to St. Vincent's Hospital between 1978 and 1988 and evaluate the patient characteristics, the occupationals involved, the causative agents and Clinical_course_HP and outcome. The characteristics of the occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP group were striking when compared to traditional occupational lung diseases, such as the pneumoconioses. These features were (i) the relatively young age--30 patients (77%) developed their disease by the age of 35, (ii) the presence of a substantial group of women--31% of the study group, and (iii) the relatively rapid Onset_HP of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP after taking up employment--56% had Asthma_ASDPTO_HP within three years of exposure. In contrast the pneumoconioses Affect_ASDPTO older, preponderantly male workers who manifest clinically symptomatic disease after decades of exposure. Long standing traditional industries were well represented ranging from milling and the bakery trade to textiles and printing. However, there was an even larger contribution from the more modern, high technology sector particularily the chemical, electronic and plastic industries.

Effective site of bronchodilation by antiAsthma_ASDPTO_HP drugs in subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.We studied the effective sites of airway response to atropine and fenoterol aerosols and to the intravenous injection of aminophylline in patients with Stable_HP and spontaneous Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, by the simultaneous assessment of respiratory resistance (Rrs) and anatomic dead space (VD). Central_HP airway response was determined by VD, and overall response was determined by Rrs. Peripheral_HP airway response was inferred from Rrs when the change in VD was slight. Atropine (4 mg/ml) or fenoterol (0.4 mg/ml) was continuously inhaled during tidal breathing for 5 minutes. Inhalation of both atropine and fenoterol increased Grs (reciprocal of Rrs) (p less than 0.01) with a simultaneous increase in VD (p less than 0.01) in the patients with Stable_HP and spontaneous Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Fenoterol increased Grs more than did atropine at an equivalent increase in VD in patients with spontaneous Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (p less than 0.05). Intravenous injection of aminophylline (250 mg) had no effect on either Grs or VD in patients with Stable_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, but it significantly increased Grs (p less than 0.01) without change in VD in patients with spontaneous Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. These results suggest that the predominant sites of bronchodilation induced by inhaled atropine are the Central_HP airways, that those sites induced by intravenous injection of aminophylline are the Peripheral_HP airways, and that inhaled fenoterol dilates both the Central_HP and Peripheral_HP airways in subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Differences among clinically used bronchodilators on the effective sites may be considered in the treatment of bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Facilitated referral to Asthma_ASDPTO_HP specialist reduces relapses in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP emergency room visits.Facilitated Asthma_ASDPTO_HP-specialist care delivered by allergists was compared to generalist care on the rate of relapse of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP emergency room (ER) visits and Hospitalizations_ASDPTO and on Asthma_ASDPTO_HP control in a prospective, controlled study of San Diego Kaiser Health Plan members with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP between the ages of 6 and 59 years presenting for Acute_HP ER care for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were systematically assigned by alternating, consecutively, the day of their ER visit to receive either (1) facilitated referral to an Asthma_ASDPTO_HP specialist within the Allergy_HP department and concomitant comprehensive ongoing Asthma_ASDPTO_HP care (intervention group, n = 149) or (2) continued outpatient management from generalist physicians (control group, n = 160). The course of their Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was evaluated blindly during the subsequent 6 months by review of medical records, initial and follow-up questionnaires, and spirometry. Compared to the control group, the intervention group noted (1) a 75% reduction in the number of, and percent of, subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP awakenings per night (p less than or equal to 0.0001), (2) an almost 50% reduction in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP ER relapses (p = 0.017) resulting from a reduction in the Frequency_HP of multiple relapse (p = 0.005), and (3) a greater use of inhaled corticosteroids (p less than 0.00001) and cromolyn (p = 0.002). Thus, facilitated referral of subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP to specialists in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP therapy after Acute_HP ER therapy appears to reduce Asthma_ASDPTO_HP ER relapses and to improve Asthma_ASDPTO_HP outcome.

Antitrypsin phenotypes in occupational organic diisocyanate Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Eleven subjects with clinical bronchial hyperreactivity towards hexamethylene diisocyanate used in their work and verified by spirometry before and after a shift were screened for their antitrypsin phenotypes by isoelectric focusing. One third were M1M1 homozygotes (over 50% in controls) while the rest were heterozygotes comprising one case, each, of M1S and M1I (expected frequencies 5 and 0.5%, respectively). It seems that heterozygous alpha 1-antitrypsin carriers may be at a greater risk to develop a pulmonary disease in the organic diisocyanate exposure than the homozygotes.

[The effects of smoke on airways].Among the numerous effects of tobacco smoke on airway mucosa, the best known and the most Frequent_HP are those leading to Chronic_Bronchitis_HP (CB) or Chronic_HP obstructive pulmonary disease (Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP). Recent studies suggest that inflammation is Central_HP to these disorders. If predominant in larger airways (diameter greater than 4 mm), inflammation is associated with CB. When predominant in small airways (diameter less than 2 mm), it can induce Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP. The exact mechanisms remain unknown. There is no useful way in early detecting evolution toward Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP in asymptomatic smokers.

IgG subclasses in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.We have measured Immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclasses in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from 12 non-Smoking_ASDPTO patients with Stable_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and 9 non-Smoking_ASDPTO Healthy_HP volunteers to obtain information on their possible role in local immunological reactions. The quotients (concentration of IgG subclass in BALF)/(concentration of IgG subclass in serum) were calculated. In controls QIgG3 were lower than QIgG1, QIgG2 and QIgG4. The IgG subclasses in BALF and epithelial lining fluid (ELF) from patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were significantly higher than in controls, mainly due to increased leakage from the blood. Again QIgG3 were lower than Q of other subclasses. In the analysis of local production of IgG, albumin or ceruloplasmin was used as reference protein. Several patients showed a local production or a preferential accumulation of one or more IgG subclasses. We conclude that in Healthy_HP persons the IgG subclasses in ELF originate from the systemic circulation by passive permeation. In patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, the permeability of the respiratory membrane may be increased resulting in increased concentrations of subclasses in lung-lining fluid. In some patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, an additional local production of IgG subclasses occurs.

[The effect of halothane, enflurane and isoflurane on resistance and compliance in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP or Chronic_HP obstructive lung diseases].In order to test the hypothesis that halothane is more effective and safer than enflurane and isoflurane in patients with Asthma_HP, a clinical trial was performed to compare these three agents in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP or Chronic_HP obstructive pulmonary disease (Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP). METHODS. After obtaining institutional approval and informed consent, 31 patients with bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP or Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP were studied (FEV1 less than 65% of FVC); all patients underwent extensive surgery of the paranasal sinuses. Premedication consisted of i.m. atropine and promethazine; anesthesia was induced with diazepam, fentanyl, etomidate, and succinylcholine and maintained with pancuronium and 50% N2O in O2 together with one of the volatile agents, halothane, enflurane, or isoflurane, selected at random. Patients were mechanically ventilated. On the basis of respiratory pressures, volumes, and flows, inspiratory (Rin) and expiratory (Rex) resistance and compliance (C) were calculated after induction (control), 15 min after the addition of the volatile agent (1.25 MAC), every 15 min during the surgical procedure, and at the end of the operation. RESULTS. In 1 case, airway resistance increased markedly a few minutes after administration of isoflurane. The results obtained in this patient were not included in the evaluation of the data. There were no statistically significant differences in the preoperative data or control values of Rin, Rex, and C among the three groups (n = 10 each). With the respective inhalational agents, Rin increased maximally between 3% (halothane) or 8% (enflurane) and 21% (isoflurane), Rex between 16% (halothane, enflurane) and 29% (isoflurane). For the most part, however, these changes were not statistically significant as compared with controls. Intergroup comparisons failed to reveal any statistically significant differences either. In all groups C decreased continuously to about 90% of control. DISCUSSION. The results show that in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP or Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP, airway resistance remains virtually unchanged during surgery and anesthesia under halothane or enflurane anesthesia. With isoflurane, however, the resistance may rise by a slight but not statistically significant extent. Furthermore, marked bronchospastic reactions occurred in 2 patients in the isoflurane group. Thus, the three volatile anesthetics studied were not found to be unequivocally safe and effective in preventing increases in bronchomotor tone. However, pharmacodynamic effects other than those on respiration (e.g., cardiovascular actions, arrhythmogenic threshold, metabolism, toxicity) must additionally be taken into consideration.
[The effect of halothane, enflurane and isoflurane on resistance and compliance in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive lung diseases].In order to test the hypothesis that halothane is more effective and safer than enflurane and isoflurane in patients with reactive airway disease, a clinical trial was performed to compare these three agents in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS. After obtaining institutional approval and informed consent, 31 patients with bronchial asthma or COPD were studied (FEV1 less than 65% of FVC); all patients underwent extensive surgery of the paranasal sinuses.

Time course of change in bronchial reactivity with an inhaled corticosteroid in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The time course of change in FEV1, bronchial reactivity, and daily measures of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP control (peak expiratory flow, symptoms, and beta 2-agonist inhaler use) was determined during 6 wk of treatment with inhaled budesonide, 800 micrograms twice a day, and for 2 wk following cessation of treatment in 40 asthmatic subjects in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study. Histamine reactivity, expressed as the provocative dose of histamine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PD20), was measured at intervals during the 8 wk of the study, with more Frequent_HP measurements after the first and last dose of drug to provide a detailed profile of change at the start and end of treatment. The first dose of budesonide caused a small increase in median values of FEV1 (0.2 L) and PD20 (1.0 doubling dose of histamine), which was maximum at 6 h. There was a further increase in FEV1 and PD20 over the 6 wk in the budesonide group relative to placebo, the maximum increases (0.53 L, 3.4 doubling doses of histamine) being recorded 6 h after the last dose on Day 42. Following cessation of treatment, FEV1 and PD20 declined and PD20 returned to placebo values at 1 wk. Median PEF increased by 40 and 30 L/min in the morning and evening, respectively, with budesonide treatment. Symptom scores and beta 2-agonist inhaler use were lower in the budesonide group than the placebo group during treatment but tended to be similar (symptom scores) or higher (beta 2-agonist) in the 2 wk following cessation of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Control of airway caliber by autonomic nerves in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and in Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP.Autonomic nerves can influence airway caliber via their effects on airway smooth muscle, bronchial vessels, and mucous glands and may therefore contribute to airway narrowing in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP or in Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP (Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP). Human lungs receive cholinergic, noradrenergic, and peptidergic efferents and several types of afferents. Cholinergic nerve activity contributes to airway narrowing both in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and in Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP. Reflex vagal activity may be enhanced because of epithelial damage and exposition of sensory nerve endings to nonspecific irritants. Other possible mechanisms include defects in prejunctional receptors that inhibit acetylcholine release, several postjunctional factors that nonspecifically enhance the effect of a given degree of cholinergic muscle contraction on airway caliber, and interactions between inflammatory mediators and the cholinergic system. The main direct bronchodilating nerve activity in human lungs is nonadrenergic, and scanty data suggest that nonadrenergic inhibitory nerve activity may be variably reduced in asthmatics. Human airway muscle virtually lacks adrenergic innervation, but adrenergic nerves may influence airway caliber by acting on bronchial vessels, mucous glands, and parasympathetic nerves and ganglia. The response of asthmatic airways to beta-agonists seems intrinsically normal, but it may be reduced during Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attacks. There are no convincing data that abnormal adrenergic control is present in the airways of patients with Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP. The physiologic relevance of excitatory neuropeptides in sensory nerves in human airways is uncertain. Tachykinins have proinflammatory and spasmogenic properties and are therefore of potential interest as a factor in the pathogenesis of obstructive airway disease. In conclusion, the data presently available support an abnormal autonomic control of the airways in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP but not in Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP.
Control of airway caliber by autonomic nerves in asthma and in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Autonomic nerves can influence airway caliber via their effects on airway smooth muscle, bronchial vessels, and mucous glands and may therefore contribute to airway narrowing in asthma or in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Human lungs receive cholinergic, noradrenergic, and peptidergic efferents and several types of afferents. Cholinergic nerve activity contributes to airway narrowing both in asthma and in COPD. Reflex vagal activity may be enhanced because of epithelial damage and exposition of sensory nerve endings to nonspecific irritants. Other possible mechanisms include defects in prejunctional receptors that inhibit acetylcholine release, several postjunctional factors that nonspecifically enhance the effect of a given degree of cholinergic muscle contraction on airway caliber, and interactions between inflammatory mediators and the cholinergic system. The main direct bronchodilating nerve activity in human lungs is nonadrenergic, and scanty data suggest that nonadrenergic inhibitory nerve activity may be variably reduced in asthmatics. Human airway muscle virtually lacks adrenergic innervation, but adrenergic nerves may influence airway caliber by acting on bronchial vessels, mucous glands, and parasympathetic nerves and ganglia. The response of asthmatic airways to beta-agonists seems intrinsically normal, but it may be reduced during severe asthma attacks. There are no convincing data that abnormal adrenergic control is present in the airways of patients with COPD. The physiologic relevance of excitatory neuropeptides in sensory nerves in human airways is uncertain. Tachykinins have proinflammatory and spasmogenic properties and are therefore of potential interest as a factor in the pathogenesis of obstructive airway disease. In conclusion, the data presently available support an abnormal autonomic control of the airways in asthma but not in COPD.
Sensory neuropeptide involvement in animal models of airway irritation and of allergen-evoked Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.C-fiber afferents in the airways are in close contact with mast cells and are activated both upon allergic reactions and by inhalation of irritants such as capsaicin and cigarette smoke. This evokes both protective reflexes such as Cough_HP as well as local release of tachykinins and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) with subsequent actions on blood vessels (vasodilatation and plasma protein extravasation) and bronchial smooth muscle (bronchoconstriction). After capsaicin pretreatment when peptides have been depleted from the sensory nerves, there is a marked reduction of the vasodilatatory response upon allergen challenge and the protein extravasation evoked by cigarette smoke. Conversely, Chronic_HP cigarette smoke exposure is accompanied by increased Cough_HPing to capsaicin challenge. Furthermore, aerosol immunization and Chronic_HP smoke exposure are both associated with elevated tissue levels of CGRP, suggesting upregulation of C-fiber function and peptide synthesis, which may contribute to airway hyperreactivity.

Characteristics of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP and in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.By studying the characteristics of BHR in subjects clearly defined as having Asthma_ASDPTO_HP or Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP, it is apparent that there are both similarities and differences. These responses can be broadly explained in terms of present knowledge of the pathologic features and the mechanisms causing the abnormalities in the two diseases, and they highlight the important differences between the diseases. It seems likely that tests of BHR with histamine and methacholine cannot be used to distinguish Asthma_ASDPTO_HP from Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP in subjects with a Mild_HP decrease in FEV1 and symptoms that do not clearly suggest Asthma_ASDPTO_HP or Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP. However, a dose-response curve to methacholine is helpful. If there is a plateau, and the PD20 FEV1 is more than 4.0 mumol, it is unlikely to be Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. If there is no plateau, a test with propranolol or SO2 may be useful to discriminate the two diseases. The similarities in the responses-especially those to histamine-explain why there is frequently difficulty in deciding the nature of the disease present in an individual subject. Is it important to distinguish the two diseases? In the introduction it was suggested that it is important for understanding these diseases, for prognosis, for treatment, and ultimately for prevention. It remains difficult to determine prognosis from any single test of bronchial responsiveness, and response to prophylaxis (stopping Smoking_ASDPTO, allergen avoidance) plus drug treatment over several years is probably needed to predict outcome in an individual patient. Finally, despite the valid hypothesis proposed by Orie and coworkers (2), it seems unlikely that studying the characteristics of BHR will shed light on the "host" factors present in both diseases that remain poorly understood.

Interaction between parenchyma and airways in Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP and in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The extent of air-space destruction caused by Emphysema_HP is very variable in Severe_HP Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP (Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP), constituting one of the most obvious differences between Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Differences in the static deflation pressure-volume curve between Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP can easily be shown, but it has been surprisingly difficult to find distinctive mechanical features of impaired airway function caused by air-space destruction. This may be because in Mild_HP airway obstruction related to Smoking_ASDPTO--particularly in younger subjects--Emphysema_HP may be absent, and the predominant site of airway narrowing in the smallest bronchi and respiratory bronchioles may be the same as that found in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in remission. In more Severe_HP obstruction caused by Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP there is almost always very Severe_HP intrinsic disease of the airways and this may so dominate the functional abnormality that it is difficult to detect any additional change because of airspace destruction. Overall, few studies have set out to detect specific effects of parenchymal destruction on airway function.

Is it useful to distinguish between Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP in respiratory epidemiology.Disagreement exists on how to define Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in population studies. Features characteristic of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP also have been demonstrated in nonasthmatic subjects. For example, although in a random sample of 339 subjects investigated in the Netherlands, subjects with a history of asthmatic attacks, wheeze and/or Dyspnea_HP, or Chronic_HP Nonproductive_Cough_HP on average were the most responsive (mean PD20 values for histamine of 11.5, 17.0, and 15.0 mg/ml) and asymptomatic subjects were the least responsive (mean PD20, 45.4 mg/ml), the distributions of PD20 values in all groups overlapped considerably. The best way to investigate the association between exposure and disease is in a cohort study. It is argued that follow-up studies in patients may have limited meaning because of a high risk for selection bias. Furthermore, in general, diagnostic disease entities will not represent homogeneous exposure groups. It is concluded that end points of disease should be defined as objectively as possible, for instance, as the level of FEV1, or as simple respiratory symptoms such as Dyspnea_HP, wheeze, or Chronic_HP Cough_HP. Terms such as "Asthma_ASDPTO_HP," "Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP," or "CNSLD" will not be helpful in defining end points because there is a risk that they could introduce bias, misclassification, and hence Confusion_HP.

Hyperresponsiveness as a determinant of the outcome in Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP.A better outcome of patients with Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP (Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP) appears to be determined by higher FEV1, Smoking_ASDPTO cessation, lower airway hyperresponsiveness, and, at least in the presence of therapy, with a higher reversibility of airflow obstruction. In our opinion, these findings provide a firm ground for Smoking_ASDPTO cessation and most likely for institution of early treatment directed at both the reversible part of airflow obstruction and airway hyperresponsiveness in patients with Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP. But there are large gaps in our understanding of the effects of bronchodilator and antiinflammatory drugs on airway hyperresponsiveness. After Acute_HP administration, sympathomimetics cause a larger reduction of airway hyperresponsiveness than do anticholinergics, both in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and in Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP. What happens after longer periods of treatment is not yet clear in Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP, whereas in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP there may occur a deterioration of airway responsiveness. Corticosteroids appear to have a beneficial effect on lung function and the Severity_HP of airway hyperresponsiveness in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. In Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP, however, no definite conclusion can be drawn as to the beneficial effect of corticosteroids, but short-term effects are not promising. The available data from the literature strongly suggest the need for long-term studies with large groups of patients in order to assess a potential treatment effect. In this way, also, a subgroup of patients with Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP who improve with corticosteroids and/or bronchodilators may be found. It seems advisable to include both subjective (i.e., quality of life, complaints, symptoms) and objective (i.e., hospitalization, survival, FEV1, PEFR, PC20, and reversibility) data as investigational tools for outcome analysis.

Clinical ventilatory functions and immunological studies in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Clinical characteristics, ventilatory functions and serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM and IgA) were assessed in 30 Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients. Sixty per cent patients belonged to early Onset_HP group ie, had Onset_HP of disease before 30 years of age. Seasonal Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics formed the largest group (56.6%) followed by perennial (26.6%) and irregular (16.6%) type. On the basis of ventilatory function tests, maximum number of cases (15) had Asthma_ASDPTO_HP of Moderate_HP Severity_HP, followed by Mild_HP (12 patients) and Severe_HP forms (3 patients). Mean serum levels (mg%) of IgG (1631.93 +/- 270.71) and IgM (233.82 +/- 86.93) were significantly elevated in Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics as compared to controls. Higher serum IgA levels were observed in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP patients (257.58 +/- 81.06) as compared to controls (225.69 +/- 49.75), but this rise was not statistically significant. Duration, periodicity of Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic attacks and the Severity_HP had no influence on the levels of the above three mentioned immunoglobulins, but it was observed that patients who had associated other Allergies_ASDPTO and positive Family_history_HP of atopic disorders exhibited higher serum IgA and IgM levels, compared to those who had no such history. This difference was however not seen in serum IgG levels.

[Symptomatic Right_HP_aortic_arch_HP in adults].A 54-year-old female presented with Dyspnea_HP on exertion and Wheezing_HP, with a negative response to inhaled beta-2 stimulating drugs and intravenous glucocorticoids. The major values of basal spirometric study were normal; however, the morphology of the flow-volume curve showed intrathoracic obstruction of large airways, with negative response to beta stimulating drugs. The bronchial provocative test with histamine was normal. Chest radiographs only showed a Mild_HP widening of the median mediastinum with Left_HP anterior tracheal displacement. Nuclear magnetic resonance showed a Right_HP_aortic_arch_HP with tracheal strangulation.

[Evaluation of the bronchodilator test].In 105 patients with Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP the bronchodilator response to salbutamol aerosol (ventolin) has been studied. According to the initial values of FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in one second) the patients were divided into four groups. Patients with Bronchitis_HP in the first group had the initial FEV1 between 600 and 1000 ml and in the second group between 100 and 2000 ml, while asthmatics in the third group had between 100 and 2000 ml and in the fourth group more than 2000 ml. The largest bronchodilator response was obtained in the groups of asthmatics (mean FEV1 increase was 473 +/- 258 ml in the third group and 609 +/- 334 ml in the fourth group). For evaluation of reversibility of obstruction of the respiratory ways after bronchodilatator tests and for better differentiation of Chronic_HP obstructive Bronchitis_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP the criteria have been proposed depending on the initial FEV1 values.

Pulse oximetry in Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The predictive value of pulse oximetry was evaluated in 100 patients who attended the emergency department with Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Oximetry after treatment with a cut off point of less than 91% had a sensitivity of 42% and specificity of 78% for unfavourable outcome, and oximetry before treatment had a sensitivity of 36% and a specificity of 57%. Despite its low sensitivity, oximetry after treatment does seem to have a role in minimising diagnostic errors in the emergency department, but only when used in conjunction with clinical assessment.

[Measurement of serum eosinophil cationic protein levels in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].We investigated the possibility of a relationship between the serum levels of eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and the clinical parameters in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. A specific question was whether or not serum ECP changes with a circadian rhythm. Eighty nine children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and sixteen normal, non-atopic subjects were studied. Serum ECP, eosinophil counts (Eo) and pulmonary functions were measured 4 or 5 times a day. ECP was quantitated by a specific radioimmunoassay. Serum ECP and Eo were significantly higher in the patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP than in non-atopic subjects. Serum ECP levels were higher during Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attacks and at 24 hours after attacks than those in Stable_HP conditions (free of attacks for more than 7 days). Although no circadian rhythm was observed in ECP changes, the patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP showed a significantly greater variation of serum ECP levels than the non-atopic subjects. There was no significant correlation between serum ECP levels and 2- or 8-week attack score before the ECP measurement. These results suggest that serum ECP increases in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, especially in its Acute_HP exacerbation phase, and may reflect eosinophil activation in vivo.

[Effects of physical training on children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].Twelve children with exercise-induced Bronchospasm_HP (EIB) participated in our physical training program to determine whether it improves physical working capacity and EIB. The effect of physical training on the bronchial reactivity to inhaled 3.6% NaCl was also investigated. The training was performed by bicycle ergometer for four weeks every day at 125% of WBPLA1 (work load at first breaking point of lactic acid). The results obtained were as follows. 1. Heart rate decreased from 188.5 +/- 9.6 bpm before to 178.4 +/- 9.7 bpm after training at 150% of WBPLA1 (p less than 0.05). After training at 175% of WBPLA1 it decreased also from 174.0 +/- 11.9 bpm to 165.6 +/- 11.3 bpm. Maximum oxygen consumption increased from 34.5 +/- 3.5 ml/min/kg to 41.4 +/- 4.0 ml/min/kg after training (p less than 0.001). 2. Max. % fall in FEV1.0 decreased from 27.1 +/- 24.0% before to 18.0 +/- 17.1% after training at 150% of WBPLA1 (p less than 0.05). After training at 175% of WBPLA1 it decreased also from 37.4 +/- 17.4% to 30.0 +/- 22.1%. 3. The mean dose of inhaled 3.6% NaCl inducing 20% fall in FEV1.0 (PD20) was 4.2 +/- 5.9 ml before training. The PD20 was significantly higher after training (8.6 +/- 4.0 ml). There was no significant change in PD20 in the control group. Based on these results, it was concluded that physical training increased physical working capacity and improved EIB and bronchial hyperreactivity to inhaled 3.6% NaCl in Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic children.

[The production of B cell stimulating activity in Peripheral_HP blood mononuclear cells from allergic children with positive IgE RAST score to egg white].We investigated B cell stimulating activity in Peripheral_HP blood mononuclear cells from allergic children with positive IgE RAST score to egg white in order to study whether interleukin-4 (IL-4) was participating in production of IgE antibody. B cell stimulating activity in Peripheral_HP blood mononuclear cells from allergic children with positive IgE RAST score to egg white stimulated with ovalbumin (OVA) was higher than that observed in allergic children with negative IgE RAST score to egg white. In allergic children with positive IgE RAST score to egg white stimulated with OVA, B cell stimulating activity in Peripheral_HP blood mononuclear cells did not correlate each other; age, IgE RIST, IgE RAST score to egg white and IgG4 antibody to egg white. These results suggest that the production of B cell stimulating activity other than IL-4 may be involved in the patients with Egg_Allergy_HP.

[Diagnostic value of skin tests in children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and/or atopic Eczema_HP].Positive test results with relevance to the patients' history resp. illness' development were seen in all age groups of patients suffering from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. In cases with Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP, but without Asthma_ASDPTO_HP or Bronchitis_HP, positive test reactions were not relevant; in these cases hyperreagibility of the skin is supposed. The results confirmed that cutaneous testing is indicated in children suffering from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, even in those cases with associated Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP provided that testing is carried out in lesion-free skin-area and beyond exacerbation of Eczema_HP. Test-results should be interpreted only with regard to the patients' history, clinical picture and its development.

[Development of atopic disease in early childhood--predisposing factors].In this study, we attempted to find factors which predispose infants to atopy. 200 unselected newborns were followed up to 3 years of age. Children with elevated cordblood IgE or positive Family_history_HP developed atopic disease significantly more Frequent_HP (p less than 0.05, p less than 0.01). Parental Smoking_ASDPTO or formula feeding alone did not influence the Frequency_HP of subsequent atopic disorders. However, in combination with reduced cordblood CD8-cells atopy was observed significantly more often (p less than 0.05, p less than 0.025). Similar results were found in children with reduced cordblood CD3-cells, whose parents were smokers (p less than 0.01). These results suggest that factors which alone do not influence atopy can enhance each other to predispose atopic disease in early childhood.

[House_dust_mite_Allergy_HP].To study efficacy of a purified and biologically standardized house dust mite extract 66 allergic children were investigated. 26 patients on immunotherapy and 21 controls with symptomatic treatment only finished the study. A significant reduction of the skin reactivity associated with an increase of allergen specific IgG-antibodies was observed. However, no significant differences were found correlating the results of inhalative provocation tests, specific IgE antibodies and symptom scores. The immunotherapy with house dust mite extracts needs further evaluation.

[Characterization of the functional interrelationship between the cardiovascular and respiratory systems in children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in the remission period].Bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is considered to be a psychosomatic disease in the genesis of which the functional instability of the subcortical brain structures and the autonomic nervous system regulating the cardio-respiratory complex play the principal role. The structural interrelationship of the values of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems in children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in the period of remission was studied. Disorders were revealed in the intersystemic regulation of the functions in relatively normal functioning of each separate system.

Channeling bias in the interpretation of drug effects.Channeling is a form of allocation bias, where drugs with similar therapeutic indications are prescribed to groups of patients with prognostic differences. Claimed advantages of a new drug may channel it to patients with special pre-existing morbidity, with the consequence that disease states can be incorrectly attributed to use of the drug. For the study of adverse drug reactions, large databases supply information on co-medication and morbidity of patients. For diseases with a stepped-care approach, the drug history of patients, as available from some databases, can show channeling of drugs to patients with markers of relatively Severe_HP disease.

[Clinical and epidemiologic aspects of ecologically induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].After prosthetics of the aortal valve 30 patients underwent bicycle ergometry training at the sanatorial stage of rehabilitation. 10 patients who did not undergo bicycle ergometry training made up the control group. The efficacy of bicycle ergometry training was assessed according to the time-course of changes in pump and contractile functions of the heart and oxygen consumption at rest and during bicycle ergometry. Transfer of the patients to a higher functional class, a decrease in the number of threshold reactions, attainment of a higher heart rate and a higher oxygen consumption, capacity for an increase of the Stroke_HP index up to the load of 1.0 W/kg and of the level of the myocardial reserve up to 1.5-2.0 W/kg were used as criteria for the effectiveness of bicycle ergometry training. The effectiveness of bicycle ergometry training is also supported by the data obtained on comparison of the findings in the main and control groups.

Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, Allergic_Rhinitis_HP and atopic Eczema_HP in Finnish children and adolescents.The parents of 3649 Finnish children and adolescents were interviewed in 1980 to evaluate the prevalence of bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, Allergic_Rhinitis_HP and Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP. The same group was interviewed 6 years later to determine the incidence of new cases of bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in the 1980s. Age- and sex-matched samples were taken from three areas, southern, eastern and northern Finland to allow assessment of possible regional differences in prevalences and incidences. The prevalences of atopic Eczema_HP, Allergic_Rhinitis_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were 1.7%, 6.0% and 4.3%, respectively. These figures are similar to those found in previous studies in Scandinavia and Finland over 10 years ago. The prevalence of atopy was highest (6.4%) in southern Finland, which is the most urbanized area of our country. The prevalence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was highest (3.3%) in northern Finland. This is still low when compared with the incidences in other European countries. THe prevalences of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and atopy were lowest in eastern Finland which is the most agrarian area. The incidence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was 1.5 cases/1000 individuals/year, but regional differences were shown.

RAST-detection of specific IgE in diphenylmethane diisocyanate exposed workers: considerations in performance of the test.Some parameters which might Affect_ASDPTO RAST results, i.e. incubation length, degree of ligand substitution, and total IgE levels, were examined in a RAST system employing diphenylmethane diisocyanate--human serum albumin (MDI-HSA) conjugates as antigens, both in exposed symptomatic and in non-exposed subjects. The reaction equilibrium was reached after 9 and 18 h. respectively, in the first and the second step of the test. A marked correlation with the degree of ligand substitution was observed, the highest sensitivity being achieved with the lowest (2.9) MDI/HSA molar ratio examined. Higher (up to 50) degrees of substitution resulted in progressively lower levels of radioactivity bound and in a loss of specificity, as confirmed by RAST inhibition experiments. At high levels of ligand substitution, high titers of total serum IgE Affect_ASDPTOed RAST results.

Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Admission chest radiography in hospitalized adult patients.The utility of admission chest radiography has been controversial in the management of adult patients admitted to the hospital with Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. We reviewed the impact of admission chest radiography on in-hospital management of 54 adult patients with Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Each patient was admitted after a failed 12-h course of bronchodilator therapy in the emergency ward. Major radiographic abnormalities were found in 20 (34 percent) of 58 occasions. These abnormalities included Focal_HP parenchymal opacities, IIM, enlarged cardiac silhouette, pulmonary vascular congestion, new solitary pulmonary nodule and Pneumothorax_HP. Subsequent antibiotic use correlated with radiographic Focal_HP opacities or IIM, even in afebrile patients, but did not correlate with elevated blood leukocyte count. Based on the evidence of in-hospital alteration of management independent of elevated blood leukocyte count and body temperature, we recommend that chest radiographs be obtained for all adult patients admitted because of Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Inhaled verapamil-induced bronchoconstriction in Mild_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Methacholine challenges were performed in ten subjects with Mild_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP at 2 h before and 20 min after placebo or 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 mg of inhaled verapamil given in a single-blind randomized crossover manner on different days. While verapamil did not have a bronchodilator effect, the 10-mg dose modestly increased the concentration of methacholine required to decrease FEV1 by 20 percent (PC20). The mean (+/- SEM) increase in PC20 from baseline was 2.1 +/- 0.2 times baseline after 10 mg of verapamil, compared to 1.1 +/- 0.1 times baseline after placebo (p less than 0.001). Unexpectedly, bronchoconstriction (greater than 10 percent decrease in FEV1) associated with Cough_HP or Wheezing_HP was observed in seven of ten subjects at doses of 20 mg or more. This adverse effect was not related to the osmolarity of the nebulized solutions. Thirty minutes before a standardized exercise challenge, 13 subjects inhaled placebo, 10 mg, or the highest dose of verapamil tolerated during the methacholine study (20 to 160 mg) in a double-blind randomized crossover manner. The exercise challenge was aborted in three subjects because of Bronchospasm_HP that occurred after administration of the higher dose. The mean (+/- SEM) maximum change in FEV1 after exercise in the ten subjects completing all three regimens of treatment was -17.1 +/- 4.0 percent after placebo, -12.7 +/- 4.3 percent after 10 mg (p less than 0.05), and -6.4 +/- 3.6 percent after the highest dose (p less than 0.05). We conclude that increasing the dose of verapamil above 10 mg did not provide greater benefit but, paradoxically, induced bronchoconstriction in most of the subjects. Because of this potential bronchoconstrictor effect, high doses of oral or intravenous verapamil should be used with caution in asthmatic subjects.

Peak expiratory flow rates in possible occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Objective criteria for interpretation of peak expiratory flow rate readings were assessed in 50 patients evaluated for suspected occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP who had at least two weeks of PEFR readings and an objective Diagnosis_ASDPTO based on other investigations. The prevalence of OA was 36 percent. Peak flows were interpreted by two observers blinded to other results. Criteria for a PEFR interpretation of OA were as follow: Diurnal_HP variation greater than or equal to 20 percent relatively more frequently or with greater variation on working days than days off work. With the objective diagnoses as the gold standard, the sensitivity of the PEFR interpretations was 72 percent for OA; specificity for no Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was 53 percent. Excluding those with greater than or equal to 20 percent variation on only one day sensitivity improved to 93 percent for OA, and specificity to 77 percent. There was an acceptable level of interobserver variation (kappa 62 to 83 percent). We conclude that simple objective criteria for PEFR interpretation can be developed with acceptable interobserver variation.

A population-based study of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in adult twin pairs.Aggregation of cases of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in adult twin pairs was studied in the nationwide Finnish twin cohort consisting of 13,888 adult monozygotic (MZ) and same-sex dizygotic (DZ) pairs. Cases of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were ascertained by record-linkage from three sources of data: death certificates from the Central_HP Statistical Office; hospital discharges from the nationwide hospital registry; and the nationwide registry for fully reimbursed Medications_ASDPTO of the Social Insurance Institution. A Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in one or more of these registers was obtained for 525 (236 men and 289 women) out of 27,776 twin individuals. Among MZ pairs, ten concordant and 138 discordant pairs were identified, while among DZ pairs, 12 concordant and 343 discordant pairs were found. In the whole sample the observed-expected ratio for the number of pairs concordant for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was 4.30 (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 2.06 to 7.90) in MZ pairs and 2.61 (95 percent CI, 1.35 to 4.56) in DZ pairs. Using a multifactorial threshold model, we estimated the correlation in liability to Asthma_ASDPTO_HP as 0.425 (SE = 0.07) in MZ twins and 0.247 (SE = 0.06) in DZ twins, and we obtained a heritability estimate of 35.6 percent. The data also showed a gender difference in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP heredity, which may, however, be due to chance events affecting the distribution of concordant pairs.

The perceptions of Canadian young adults with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP of their health teaching/learning needs.Nurses maintain that they can assist individuals with Chronic_HP illness to cope with their health problems experienced in daily living through health (patient) teaching. However, several authors claim that in Planning_ASDPTO health teaching, nurses tend to rely on their perceptions of the learning needs of persons, as opposed to drawing upon the individual's understanding of their needs. Few research studies have investigated the health teaching needs of persons with Chronic_HP illness from their unique point of view. This study examined the perceived learning needs to manage the associated health problems of young adults with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The University of British Columbia Model for Nursing provided an innovative and holistic means to attain perceptions in the health teaching assessment process and facilitated the development of a learning needs assessment tool. Survey methodology was used. A convenience sample of 40 young adults between the ages of 20 and 45 years was interviewed. Twenty of the sample resided in British Columbia, Canada, and 20 in Ontario, Canada. Implications of findings are discussed with regard to nursing practice.

Esophageal Chest_Pain_ASDPTO_HP in children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Sixteen patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Chest_Pain_ASDPTO_HP of greater than 2 months duration underwent gastroenterological evaluation utilizing fiber-optic esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), esophageal manometry, and Bernstein testing. Eleven of 16 patients (75%) had endoscopic and histologic evidence of Esophagitis_HP. One patient with Esophagitis_HP exhibited high-amplitude peristaltic contractions during motility testing. Four of these 11 patients (36%) had a positive Bernstein test. Extended intraesophageal pH monitoring of seven patients with Esophagitis_HP revealed significant Gastroesophageal_reflux_HP (GER) in all of these patients. Chest_Pain_ASDPTO_HP was associated with an episode of GER in three patients (43%). Nine of 11 patients (82%) with Esophagitis_HP responded to medical therapy, resulting in resolution of esophageal inflammation and Chest_Pain_ASDPTO_HP. One patient required Nissen fundoplication surgery after failure of medical therapy, and one patient who refused surgery progressively developed more Severe_HP Esophagitis_HP during 9 months of medical therapy. Children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP may have Chest_Pain_ASDPTO_HP due to Gastroesophageal_reflux_HP-associated Esophagitis_HP that usually responds to medical therapy.

Effect of 0.25 ppm nitrogen dioxide on the airway response to methacholine in asymptomatic asthmatic patients.In asthmatic patients, short-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide at low concentrations has been reported to result in a nonuniform airway response to various bronchoconstrictive stimuli. We therefore investigated in 11 patients with Mild_HP and Stable_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP with normal baseline airway tone the effect of 0.25 ppm nitrogen dioxide on the airway response to methacholine. On 2 separate days, the subjects inhaled either 0.25 ppm nitrogen dioxide or filtered air (sham) during 20 min of tidal breathing followed by 10 min of bicycle exercise at room temperature (mean exercise ventilation 30 L/min). Methacholine inhalation tests were performed 1 h after the end of exercise to determine the methacholine concentration necessary to increase SRaw by 100% (PC100SRaw). On a third day, a methacholine challenge was done without previous exposure (control). Mean (SEM) exercise-induced increase of SRaw was 80 (24) % after sham and 82 (25) % after nitrogen dioxide, which was not significantly different (p greater than 0.10). PC100SRaw did not differ on the 3 occasions, geometric mean values (variability of mean) being 0.41 (1.6). 0.41 (1.6), and 0.46 (1.5) mg/ml after sham, nitrogen dioxide, and control, respectively (p less than 0.10). We therefore conclude that in patients with Mild_HP and Stable_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP short-term exposure to 0.25 ppm nitrogen dioxide during rest and exercise does not increase methacholine responsiveness 1 h after exposure.

[Eosinophilic lesions of the lungs (case reports and review of the literature)].Overall 75 references concerning the etiology, pathogenesis and the clinical picture of eosinophilic lesions of the lungs were analyzed. Sixteen patients with drug-induced disease were placed under the author's observation. Of these, 8 patients fell ill due to penicillin, 3 to tetracycline, 3 to sulfanilamide intake and alpha to intal inhalations. In 10 patients, Pneumonia_HP was characterized by high blood Eosinophilia_HP (from 20 to 53%, 37.5 +/- 2.7%) and in 6, it was of Moderate_HP nature (from 10 to 15%, 11.8 +/- 0.8%). According to the author's data, the immunopathological response coupled with suppression of the T lymphocyte system, inhibition of the enzymatic activity of leukocytes, dysproteinemias with Increased_antibody_level_in_blood_HP, reductions of the concentration of IgG underlie the disease pathogenesis. In the patients with high blood Eosinophilia_HP, including 4 with polysystemic lesions, the disease ran a grave course. The therapeutic effect could only be attained owing to the monotherapy with prednisolone. In the long-term period, 9 patients developed glucocorticoid-dependent Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The patients with Moderate_HP blood Eosinophilia_HP showed a milder disease course and a favourable outcome.

[Potential of the anticholinergic drug troventol in the treatment and Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].A study was made of potentialities of the Soviet drug troventol in the Diagnosis_ASDPTO and treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. 143 patients suffering from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and 38 patients with pollenosis were examined for external respiratory function using a microprocessor spiroanalyzer, the immunological status and clinical symptoms. The importance of carrying out the diagnostic test with troventol in revealing latent Bronchospasm_HP was established, the bronchodilatory effect of troventol at the level of the large bronchi was demonstrated as was a decrease of the emotional manifestations together with the immunomodulatory effect. Beneficial results were attained in 67.8% of cases, satisfactory in 16.8%, and unsatisfactory in 15.4%. Untoward effects in the form of Tachycardia_HP were recorded in 3.5% of patients, Bradycardia_HP in 5.6%, Xerostomia_HP in 16.1% of patients.

[Possibilities of using the biofeedback method in the combined modality therapy of patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].The efficacy of biological feedback was studied in multimodality treatment of patients suffering from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Use was made of a device modified by the authors themselves. In that device, the system of the patient's respiration control was synchronized with the block of diaphragmatic pacing. The method was shown to be highly effective. The clinical status of the patients improved. The changes in the capnographic parameters attest to a decrease of Hyperventilation_HP in patients suffering from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

[Use of plateletpheresis in the treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].It was shown that platelets of Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients notwithstanding the disease form are more sensitive to the stimulating action of platelet-activating factor (PAF) in aggregation response and intracellular Ca2+ influx induction than platelets of Healthy_HP donors. Intracellular Ca2+ influx was measured using the fluorescent probe Fura-2. Platelet apheresis was applied attempting to normalize the "hyperactivated" state of Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients' platelets. Platelet apheresis was performed using the on-line cell separator Fenwal CS-3000 in 27 patients without any considerable side effects. The mean platelet yield was 400-600 X 10(9) cells; the blood platelet count restored immediately after the treatment. Positive clinical effect (complete reduction of Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic attacks for at least 2 months, improvement in respiratory function parameters) was observed in 19 out of the 27 patients (70%). The clinical effect correlated well with the normalization of in-vitro platelet response to PAF.

[Sudden_death_HP in childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP: report of one case].Sudden_death_HP from childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is Very_rare_HP in Taiwan. This is a case report of an eight-year-old boy who had been a victim of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP since age five. He attained school regularly. Two days before death, he suffered from Dyspnea_HP, but the symptoms were relieved by oral drugs of beta 2-agonist and aminophylline. The drugs usually administered when he had attacks. Unfortunately he jumped and fell when he watched TV with his family at about 5 o'clock in the afternoon. He was cyanotic with Apnea_HP. He expired in spite of cardiopulmonary resuscitation for three hours in our hospital.

Maximal expiratory flow-volume types in young subjects with past history of nasal Allergy_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Pulmonary function tests were performed on 252 Healthy_HP young subjects free from respiratory and allergic symptoms, and 80 young subjects with past history of nasal Allergy_HP (PNA) and 10 subjects with past history of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (PBA). All the subjects were non-smokers. Maximal expiratory flow-volume (MEFV) curves were visually classified into five types (A-E). The percent distribution of type A in Healthy_HP subjects was significantly higher than in the PNA group, while the total sum of percentage of types B, C, and D in the PNA group was significantly higher than in the Healthy_HP subjects. The percent distribution of type E in the PNA group was similar to that in the Healthy_HP subjects. The percent distribution of MEFV types were significantly different between Healthy_HP males and Healthy_HP females. The percent distribution of types A, B and E were the highest in Healthy_HP subjects, PNA and PBA groups, respectively. Conclusively, the difference in the percent distributions of MEFV types was recognized among Healthy_HP subjects, PNA and PBA groups.

Adrenal atrophy at autopsy in two asthmatic children.In two children dying in Status_asthmaticus_HP, adrenocortical atrophy was demonstrable at autopsy. Both children had been treated since infancy with pulsed steroidal inhalers, short courses of oral or parenteral steroids, and steroidal skin preparations (for associated Eczema_HP). Adrenocortical atrophy has not been described previously in this clinical context. The increasing administration of steroids to asthmatic children may lead to the production of overt--or more frequently, subclinical--atrophy of the adrenal cortices with important consequences to mortality and morbidity.

Acute_HP exacerbation of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in children associated with afternoon weather changes.We studied the effect of the weather on Acute_HP exacerbations of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in children by comparing records of 8,657 admissions for five Acute_HP respiratory diseases (3,064 for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP) with concurrent meteorologic data. These diseases were classified according to their interrelations and distinct meteorologic patterns into two groups: (1) Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Acute_HP laryngitis, which are correlated with the afternoon gradients of air temperature, heat content (the thermal energy of the ambient air), and modified heat content factor (the energy required to heat the air water vapor to the ambient temperature), but not correlated with the absolute values of air temperature and water content: and (2), bronchoPneumonia_HP/Pneumonia_HP and upper Respiratory_tract_infection_HP, which are correlated only with the absolute values of the meteorologic parameters (air temperature, water content, heat content, and modified heat content factor), but not with their afternoon gradients. Admissions for Bronchiolitis_HP revealed an age-related pattern: up to 1 yr they resembled Group 2 and from 1 to 2 yr, Group 1. It follows that the admission rates of Acute_HP exacerbation of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in childhood are linked both to the afternoon weather gradients and to some of the Acute_HP Respiratory_tract_infection_HP.

Nonspecific bronchial reactivity in asthmatic children depends on Severity_HP but not on age.Bronchial reactivity to inhaled methacholine was measured by the steady-state tidal breathing method in asthmatic children aged 1 to 17 yr. The children were divided into three clinical groups according to their minimal therapeutic requirements: Mild_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, children requiring infrequent treatment with inhaled beta-agonists (81 patients); Moderate_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, children requiring daily preventive treatment with either cromolyn sodium or slow-release theophylline (67 patients); and Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, children requiring daily preventive treatment with oral or inhaled steroids (34 patients). They were also divided into three age groups: from 1 to 6 yr, tested by using bronchial provocation with tracheal auscultation (BPTA) to determine the methacholine concentration causing Wheezing_HP (PCW); and from 7 to 11 yr and 12 to 17 yr, using lung function testing to determine the concentration causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20). For the whole group the mean level of bronchial reactivity to methacholine correlated inversely with the Severity_HP of bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP according to the minimal drug requirements (p less than 0.0001) and was similar over the whole age range (p less than 0.9965) for each Severity_HP grouping. In the older children the difference between Moderate_HP and Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was not significant, but this may have been a result of the effect of corticosteroids in the Severe_HP group. We concluded that age has no significant effect on the methacholine response in asthmatic children over a wide age range.

Measurement of breathlessness during exercise in asthmatics. Predictor variables, reliability, and responsiveness.The purpose of this study was to determine the predictor variables for breathlessness and to investigate the criteria of reliability and responsiveness for measuring breathlessness during Progressive_HP, incremental exercise on the cycle ergometer. We studied a Heterogeneous_HP group of patients with Stable_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (mean +/- SEM age, 46 +/- 4 yr) for four visits at weekly intervals. Predictor variables were determined at the first visit. Nine independent physiologic variables were obtained at each minute during exercise; the Borg rating of breathlessness (range 0 to 10) was used as the dependent variable. The regression model relating the physiologic parameters to the Borg rating of breathlessness was highly significant (model F = 43.4; p = 0.0001). Backward elimination selected the strongest predictors of the Borg rating: peak inspiratory flow (VI); tidal volume (VT)/FVC; Frequency_HP of respiration (f); and peak inspiratory mouth pressures (Pm). These four variables explained 63% of the variance in the rating of Dyspnea_HP. Each of the four variables exhibited a linear relationship with the Borg rating. Test-retest reliability was assessed by comparing results at the first and second visits. Individual slopes (except for VT/FVC) and intercepts for the four predictor variables versus Borg ratings were highly reliable. The slope for work Severity_HP (watts) and Borg ratings, but not the intercept, was highly reliable. Responsiveness was evaluated by randomly administering inhaled methacholine or inhaled metaproterenol, alternately, at the third and fourth visits to induce Acute_HP changes in lung function before exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Effect of cold air on the bronchial response to inhaled histamine in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.We measured the concentration of inhaled histamine required to reduce the FEV1 by 20% (PC20) in seven asthmatic patients immediately following the inhalation of warm air (mean temperature +/- 1 SD, 21.1 +/- 1.1 degrees C) and following cold air inhalation (-10.2 +/- 5.0 degrees C). Patients breathed either warm or cold air for 10 min before 30-s challenges with doubling concentrations of aerosolized histamine that were nebulized while the subject breathed warm air. Before histamine inhalation minute ventilation (VI) was 8.41 +/- 1.38 L/min breathing warm air and 7.86 +/- 0.97 L/min breathing cold air. Respiratory heat exchange (RHE) was 0.25 +/- 0.05 kcal/min with warm air and 0.24 +/- 0.03 kcal/min with cold air. The PC20 obtained following cold air breathing (0.48 +/- 4.63 mg/ml) was lower than that following warm air breathing (0.85 +/- 4.60 mg/ml; p less than 0.02). We conclude that breathing cold air increases the bronchial reactivity to inhaled histamine in asthmatic patients.

Immediate and late inflammatory responses to ragweed antigen challenge of the Peripheral_HP airways in allergic asthmatics. Cellular, mediator, and permeability changes.Asthma_ASDPTO_HP may represent the clinical manifestations of a unique form of Chronic_HP airway inflammation and is often associated with Allergy_HP. To better define the components of allergic inflammation in the lung, fluids obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were examined for cells, inflammatory mediators, and markers of airway permeability 5 min and 19 h following instillation of ragweed antigen directly into an airway segment of allergic asthmatic subjects. The 5-min response to antigen challenge (n = 10) was characterized by 17- to 208-fold increases in histamine, prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), and its metabolite, 9 alpha,11 beta-PGF2, thromboxane B2, and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha compared with a saline-challenged segment (0.004 less than p less than 0.017). The increases in most of these mediators were significantly correlated with each other (0.0001 less than p less than or equal to 0.01), and the magnitude of all significant mediator increases was directly correlated with skin test sensitivity to ragweed antigen (0.007 less than or equal to p less than or equal to 0.05). There was also a slight increase in kinins (p = 0.04). Changes in cells and airway permeability were not detected. In contrast, the 19-h response to antigen challenge (n = 9) was characterized by a 13-fold increase in total cells recovered by BAL. Eosinophils, basophils, and lymphocytes were significantly increased and comprised 38, 1, and 9% of total cells, respectively. A neutrophil influx was also observed but was not specific for antigen challenge since a similar change was observed in a sham, saline-challenged site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

The 5-min response to antigen challenge (n = 10) was characterized by 17- to 208-fold increases in histamine, prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), and its metabolite, 9 alpha,11 beta-PGF2, thromboxane B2, and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha compared with a saline-challenged segment (0.004 less than p less than 0.017). The increases in most of these mediators were significantly correlated with each other (0.0001 less than p less than or equal to 0.01), and the magnitude of all significant mediator increases was directly correlated with skin test sensitivity to ragweed antigen (0.007 less than or equal to p less than or equal to 0.05). There was also a slight increase in kinins (p = 0.04). Changes in cells and airway permeability were not detected. In contrast, the 19-h response to antigen challenge (n = 9) was characterized by a 13-fold increase in total cells recovered by BAL. Eosinophils, basophils, and lymphocytes were significantly increased and comprised 38, 1, and 9% of total cells, respectively. A neutrophil influx was also observed but was not specific for antigen challenge since a similar change was observed in a sham, saline-challenged site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Elevated bronchoalveolar lavage fluid histamine levels in allergic asthmatics are associated with increased airway obstruction.Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was evaluated for histamine and tryptase levels in 61 samples (46 samples from 24 atopic asthmatics, seven samples from seven patients with Allergic_Rhinitis_HP, and eight samples from eight normal volunteers). Asthmatics and patients with Allergic_Rhinitis_HP had significantly higher BAL histamine than did normal subjects (169 +/- 22, 141 +/- 23, 42 +/- 6 pg/ml, respectively; p less than 0.05, both comparisons). BAL fluid tryptase levels were also higher in asthmatics and patients with Allergic_Rhinitis_HP than in normal subjects (0.36 +/- 0.03, 0.38 +/- 0.05, 0.23 +/- 0.04 ng/ml, respectively; p less than 0.05, both comparisons); however, levels of tryptase and histamine in BAL were not correlated (r = -0.03 in the group as a whole, r = -0.12 in the asthmatic group). BAL concentration of histamine correlated inversely with FEV1 percent predicted in the asthmatic group (r = -0.44, p less than 0.005). Asthmatics with high BAL fluid histamine (greater than or equal to 100 pg/ml, n = 23) had lower FEV1 percent predicted (80 +/- 3% versus 96 +/- 3%, p = 0.0005), lower FEV1/FVC ratio (72 +/- 1% versus 77 +/- 2%, p less than 0.05), higher percentage of BAL eosinophils (2.2 +/- 0.4% versus 0.6 +/- 0.1%, p less than 0.002), and greater airway responsiveness (lower PD20 [13.1 +/- 3.4 versus 41.5 +/- 13.7 cumulative breath units, p less than 0.05]) compared with asthmatics with low BAL fluid histamine (less than 100 pg/ml, n = 23).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Ventilation-perfusion mismatch after methacholine challenge in patients with Mild_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.To investigate the effects of methacholine (MTH) challenge on spirometry, lung mechanics, respiratory gases, and ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) distributions, 16 subjects 16 to 58 yr of age with Stable_HP Mild_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (FEV1, 92 +/- 5% [SEM] predicted; FEF25-75, 71 +/- 7% predicted; respiratory system resistance (Rrs) at 4 Hz, 4.6 +/- 0.4 cm H2O/L-1 s; PaO2, 88 +/- 3 mm Hg; AaPO2, 23 +/- 3 mm Hg) were recruited. Baseline VA/Q distributions were unimodal and relatively narrow in 12 patients and modestly bimodal in the other four. The dispersion of pulmonary blood flow (log SD Q) was slightly enlarged (0.71 +/- 0.09) and that of ventilation (log SD V) was normal (0.57 +/- 0.04) (normal range, 0.3 to 0.6); an index of overall VA/Q Heterogeneous_HP (DISP R-E*) was also Mild_HPly abnormal (5.3 +/- 0.8) (normal values less than 3.0). After MTH challenge, FEV1, FEF25-75, and PaO2 fell (to 62 +/- 3 and 35 +/- 3% predicted, and to 71 +/- 1 mm Hg, respectively), whereas Rrs (p less than 0.001 each), minute ventilation (p less than 0.02), heart rate (p less than 0.01), and AaPO2 increased (p less than 0.001). VA/Q relationships Mild_HPly to moderately worsened (log SD Q increased to 0.98 +/- 0.04 [p less than 0.01], log SD V to 0.79 +/- 0.04, and DISP R-E* to 9.8 +/- 0.6 [p less than 0.001 each]). Qualitatively, the pattern of blood flow distribution was broadly unimodal in 13 patients and modestly bimodal in three, of whom only one had a bimodal baseline distribution.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Differential effects of aging and disease on trabecular and compact bone density of the radius.We constructed a special purpose CT system to get a spatial resolution of 0.2 mm and developed a procedure for the precise determination of trabecular and compact bone density (TBD and CBD) in the radius. Seven groups of Healthy_HP females and patients were measured to explore differential effects on compact and trabecular bone. In Healthy_HP females CBD remains constant within 0.2% from age 20 to 70. TBD measured in the same individuals is reduced by 50%. The scatter of the individual CBD values is 1.5% only, that of TBD 20%. Longitudinal examinations of corticosteroid treated asthmatics during one year showed a loss of TBD of 4.8%. During the same period CBD remained completely Stable_HP. In other diseases such as Hyperparathyroidism_HP CBD is reduced as well. This study showed the feasibility of a noninvasive determination of the density of compact bone and demonstrated that density loss of compact and trabecular bone is considerably different.

[Acupuncture therapy in the treatment of patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].Erythron membrane impairment was investigated using membrane -active drugs (obsidan, delagil, morphium, ethanol) to specify indications to acupuncture in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (BA). The patients were studied during the treatment and followed up for a year. It was found that both immediate and long-term results of acupuncture were related to patterns of the membrane impairment. BA patients with a Sharp_HP, greater than 1.5 fold diminution of microcyte count upon delagil test should be assigned to repeated courses of acupuncture during a year. To monitor the treatment effect, it is recommended to define osmotic resistance of the red blood cells in obsidan test in addition to clinicofunctional indices.

Parental attitude and role perception in families of asthmatic children.The attitude of the parents of 30 asthmatic children, was studied in four subjects: 1) Parental behavior, 2) modes of coping with every day events, 3) parent-child communication, and 4) Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP and fears towards the child's health. The following situations were observed: The parents of asthmatic children showed a higher level of Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP towards the health of the children in comparison with parents in control group (p less than 0.01). The coping modes of Israeli born parents scored higher than parents born in North Africa or Asia. Parents from other countries scored the lowest of the three (p = 0.004). The behavior pattern of parents of children with Mild_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was more controlled than parents of children with Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (p less than 0.05). Chronic_HP and Prolonged_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP cause a decrease in communication between the parents and child (P less than 0.05). The number of children in the family has a direct effect upon the degree of the parent's Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP towards the child's health. Parents who have 1-2 children, one of which is asthmatic, were found to be more anxious than parents with 3-4 children. The above mentioned data influence the parental behavior, which was better when the first or second child was asthmatic than if he was the third or fourth child in the family. Coping with Chronic_HP disease of the asthmatic child should include medical and behavioral education of his parents by the medical and paramedical staff in the hospital and in the respiratory clinic.

Nocturnal_HP airflow obstruction, histamine, and the autonomic Central_HP nervous system in children with allergic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.A study was carried out to investigate whether an Postural_instability_HP in the autonomic nervous system or release of histamine, or both, is responsible for the Nocturnal_HP increase in airflow obstruction in asthmatic children. The study comprised 18 children with allergic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, nine with (group 1) and nine without (group 2) Nocturnal_HP airflow obstruction, and an age matched control group. All drugs were withheld for three days before and during the study. On day 4 each child was admitted to hospital and a series of measurements was made every four hours for 24 hours. These included measurements of the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), heart rate and sinus Arrhythmia_HP gap from an electrocardiogram (an indirect measure of parasympathetic activity) and urine sampling for determination of catecholamine and N'-methylhistamine concentrations (measures of sympathetic activity and histamine release respectively). Urinary N'-methylhistamine excretion was significantly higher over the 24 hours in children in group 1 than in children in group 2, and overnight values were also significantly higher in children in group 1 than those in group 2. Mean (SEM) values (mumol/mol creatinine) were 154.6 (11.2) in group 1 and 110 (11.2) in group 2 for 2400-0400 hours samples and 139.2 (13.1) and 101.2 (10.6) 0400-0800 hours samples. There was no evidence of decreased sympathetic or increased parasympathetic activity in association with the Nocturnal_HP airflow obstruction; noradrenaline concentrations were increased in group 1. These observations indicate that Nocturnal_HP airflow obstruction is associated with increased release of histamine overnight.

[Fundamental studies on measurement of the eosinophil cationic protein in sputum from patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].One of the characteristics of patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is activation of eosinophils in the bronchi, which can be evaluated by measuring concentrations of the cationic granule proteins. Sputum seems to be the best material to evaluate the activation of eosinophils in the bronchi because it can be collected easily from the same patient every day even if he (she) has an Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic attack. Recently it has become possible to measure the concentration of the eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) thanks to the availability of the ECP RIA kit. However no fundamental studies have been carried out on the handling of sputum samples, and whether only ECP released into sputum is measured. We prepared supernatants of sputum samples according to the method of Gleich and others by adding the same volume of physiological saline, mixing it for one minute by a vortex mixer and centrifuging at 40000 Xg, 4 C, for 30 minutes. We found that the measurement of ECP is not inhibited by materials in sputum supernatants through a dilution test and a recovery test. We also found that the followings did not influence the measurement of ECP; the times of dilution, the duration from collection to handing of sputum, the solution added to sputum, and the gravity of centrifugation. In addition, it was suggested that only ECP released into sputum is measurable from the results of an electron microscopic study and the measurement of ECP after centrifugation following the addition of white blood cells to sputum.

[Eosinophil chemotactic activity in the supernatant of mononuclear cell culture stimulated with specific antigen].Peripheral_HP blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) separated from patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP who were sensitive to Dermatophagoides farinae (Df) were cultured in alpha-medium for 5 days at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2, in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml of Df antigen. Eosinophils were purified from the Peripheral_HP blood of patients with Eosinophilia_HP who were not sensitive to Df. Eosinophil chemotactic activity (ECA) was tested using a modified Boyden chamber method. ECA in the supernatant of PBMC stimulated with Df antigen was detectable after 24 hrs, peaked at 72 hrs and continued throughout the experiment. ECA was not observed in the supernatant of PBMC culture from subjects who were not sensitive to Df, and negligible activity was also observed when PBMC were stimulated with an unrelated antigen. The activity was unchanged by heating at 56 degrees C for 30 min, but was inactivated at 100 degrees C for 10 min. CV-6209, a specific PAF antagonist, failed to inhibit this chemotactic activity. The molecular weight of this eosinophil chemotactic factor (ECF) was greater than 30,000 daltons as determined by an ultrafiltration study. In conclusion, these data suggest that in asthmatic patients sensitive to Dermatophagoides farinae mononuclear cells stimulated with a related antigen produce one of cytokine(s) which possess(es) ECA, and may play an important role in the recruitment of eosinophils in Chronic_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

[A double blind study of the effectiveness of ketotifen in preventing the development of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP patients].Many asthmatic children have experienced Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP in their younger days. As it is very difficult to cure childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP we attempted to determine the anti-allergic drug effects in preventing the development of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP by using ketotifen on Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP patients. The study was designed as a placebo controlled double blind trial of 128 Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP patients aged from 2-34 months. 91 patients were given complete analysis in the study, 33 patients were given only a safety rate and 4 patients were dropped. The 91 patients were followed for 52 weeks. Our primary finding was that the development of bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was inhibited in the ketotifen group compared to the placebo controlled group with a statistically significant degree (p less than 0.001). We also found that clinical symptoms of Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP were significantly improved in the ketotifen group (p less than 0.001). Only 5 patients complained of Mild_HP side effects.

Our primary finding was that the development of bronchial asthma was inhibited in the ketotifen group compared to the placebo controlled group with a statistically significant degree (p less than 0.001). We also found that clinical symptoms of atopic dermatitis were significantly improved in the ketotifen group (p less than 0.001). Only 5 patients complained of mild side effects.
[Involvement of platelet activating factor (PAF) in ovalbumin antigen-induced late asthmatic response and increase of airway hyperresponsiveness in a guinea pig experimental model of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].Platelet activating factor, a potent chemical mediator, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in terms of inflammatory cell recruitment and activation. We have recently demonstrated that repeated antigen (ovalbumin; OA) exposure by inhalation to guinea pigs results in a development of late asthmatic response (LAR) in more than 50% of the animals and significant increase in airway hyperresponsiveness (AH). We have studied the effect of WEB 2086, a specific PAF receptor-antagonist, on this model. Respiratoly resistance (Res) of guinea pigs was measured by a oscillation technique and AH was evaluated by the provocative concentration of aerosols of histamine causing 200% increase of Rrs over the baseline Rrs (PC200 Hist). Four out of 5 actively sensitized and diphenhydramine-pretreated animals developed LAR 3 to 9 hr after allergen (20 mg/ml OA, 10 min inhalation)-induced immediate bronchoconstriction (LAR). Treatment with WEB 2086 (3 mg/kg intravenously) 30 min before and 3 hr after the exposure suppressed LAR clearly without Affect_ASDPTOing the IAR. Significant increase in AH from 2.80 +/- 0.03 to 2.51 +/- 0.01 and 2.60 +/- 0.08 (p less than 0.05, n = 8) of PC200 Hist (mg/ml, log) was observed 24 hr and 5 day after the OA exposure, respectively. The WEB 2086 treatment also prevented the increase of AH after the OA exposure (PC200 Hist; 2.82 +/- 0.09 before the challenge 2.80 +/- 0.07 and 2.75 +/- 0.09 24 hr and 5 days after, respectively. n = 8). Administration of WEB 2086 did not Affect_ASDPTO baseline Rrs and PC200 Hist in normal guinea pigs without any antigen challenge. We conclude that WEB 2086 is capable of preventing the development of LAR and increase in AH, and thus PAF may play an important causal role in LAR and increased AH observed in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

A pilot study of surfactant inhalation in the treatment of asthmatic attack.The pulmonary surfactant is thought to be important in the stability of the small airways. In this study, we conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine whether surfactant inhalation has a therapeutic effect in asthmatic attack. Eleven patients with asthmatic attack whose conditions were Stable_HP for at least six hours before the study were randomly assigned to placebo or surfactant inhalation. Respiratory function tests and blood gas analysis were performed before and 20 minutes after the treatment. After placebo administration, no significant change was observed from baseline in pulmonary functions. After surfactant administration (1 ml; 10 mg per milliliter), respiratory functions were markedly improved in all patients. The mean (+/- SE) change in the FVC, FEV1.0, MMF, delta N2 and PaO2 was, respectively, an increase of 11.7 +/- 1.3% (p less than 0.001), an increase of 27.3 +/- 4.4% (p less than 0.05), an increase of 33.3 +/- 4.7% (p less than 0.05), a decrease of 31 +/- 8.4% (p less than 0.05) and an increase of 13.4 +/- 0.8% (p less than 0.05). No difference was detected in PaCO2 after surfactant inhalation. This study indicates that airway surfactant is involved in the pathogenesis of bronchoobstruction of the patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

[Accelerated desensitization to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus mites in children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Results of two years of immunotherapy].16 children with Chronic_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were given a rush immunotherapy with standardized Dermatophagoides Pteronyssinus extracts. For two years, the dose of 10 IR was injected monthly. Before this rush, six children have received a typical immunotherapy ineffective on Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Examination of clinical, medication, immuno-allergologic and functional parameters were recorded before and at 6, 12 and 24 months of the follow-up. Rush immunotherapy was well tolerated. Substantial improvement of asthmatic syndrome was seen in 12 children. Skin sensitivity decreased significantly since 6 months (p less than 0.001). Laboratory results were not changed. At 24 months, improvement of CRF Helium was showed (p less than 0.01). This study with two years follow-up shows that specific immunotherapy is efficacy and possible in children with Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Symptom, medication, functional scores were substantial improvement.

Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in New Zealand: implications for North America.In the early 1980s, reports of a significant rise in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP mortality emanated from New Zealand. Difficulties in accessing medical care, noncompliance with medication, inadequate medical management, lack of patient education, and inadequate recognition of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Severity_HP have been suggested as factors that may have contributed to the excess of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP mortality. Asthma_ASDPTO_HP mortality has now declined significantly in New Zealand. We traveled to New Zealand to examine why the incidence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP deaths declined in that country at the time where it may have continued to rise in North America. We hypothesize that increased patient and physician education, targeting of high-risk socioeconomic groups, and increased public awareness have played a large role in these improved statistics. The measures taken in New Zealand which have involved a cooperative approach between lay organizations, the pharmaceutical industry, government agencies, and medical personnel may be adapted to North America with, it is hoped, similar results.

Effect of phenytoin sodium in the management of poorly controlled Asthma_ASDPTO_HP at a rural health center in Phalodi, Rajasthan, India.The efficacy of phenytoin (PHT) for the relief of Chronic_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was evaluated in an open trial in 190 intractable rural Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics. Our data indicate that phenytoin (100 mg po bid for adults and 50 mg po bid for children) is a useful antiAsthma_ASDPTO_HPtic agent used either alone, or as adjuvant therapy. Phenytoin significantly reduced the Frequency_HP and Severity_HP of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attacks, Cough_HP, Nocturnal_HP awakenings, and work absenteeism, and improved effort tolerance and subjective sense of well being. Phenytoin also reduces corticosteroid requirements of steroid-dependent patients. Not only were these results sustained over the course of 12-month treatment, but more than 60% of phenytoin-treated patients could be discontinued without recurrence of symptoms.

Identification of soybean dust as an epidemic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP agent in urban areas by molecular marker and RAST analysis of aerosols.From 1981 to 1987, 26 outbreaks of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP have occurred in the city of Barcelona, Spain, affecting a total of 687 subjects and causing 1155 emergency room admissions. Assays of urban aerosols collected with high-volume samplers between October 1986 and May 1989 have indicated that soybean dust originating from harbor activities (and not traffic or industrial pollution) is the causal agent for these epidemics. Soybean particulates in the filters have been characterized from the composition of the alcohol fraction, namely, campesterol, stigmasterol, beta-sitosterol, n-triacontan-1-ol, and n-dotriacontan-1-ol, constituting a series of aerosol components correlated with the epidemiologic data. This result has also been confirmed by immunochemical assay of specific soybean allergens. The concentration of these sterols in the air corresponds to a 24-hour average level of soybean dust in the order of 25 micrograms/m3 on epidemic days. These results suggest the advisability of monitoring soybean dust in air particulates of populated areas surrounding soybean storage or processing plants. The techniques presented here afford a simple way for the recognition of soybean dust in aerosols containing high concentrations of organic pollutants of traffic or industrial origin.

The distribution of bronchial responsiveness to histamine and exercise in 527 children and adolescents.The aim of the study was to describe the bronchial responsiveness to inhaled histamine and exercise in a randomly selected group of 527 children and adolescents from Copenhagen, aged between 7 to 16 years. The distribution of the bronchial responsiveness was described as (1) the provoking concentration that causes a 20% reduction in FEV1 (2) the dose-response slope (DRS), that is, the linear slope of the dose-response curve, and (3) reduction in FEV1 after 6 minutes of exercise on a treadmill. The distribution of the concentration that causes a 20% reduction in FEV1 in the responsive range was not significantly different from a unimodal distribution, although the findings were skewed toward the less responsive end of the range (p greater than 0.05). The subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP represented a subgroup within the responsive distribution tail rather than a separate distribution peak. In asymptomatic individuals, the values of DRS were distributed symmetrically on a logarithmic scale. The deviation from normal was such that the standard deviation only slightly underestimated the "normal" range. The distribution of the bronchial response to exercise was found to be significantly different from a normal distribution. However, a significant relationship was found between the bronchial response to inhaled histamine and exercise (p less than 0.0001). We conclude that there is a log-normal distribution of the bronchial response to inhaled histamine in a random sample of children and adolescents.

House dust mite sensitization in children and residential characteristics in a temperate region.House dust mite (Hdm) infestation used to be rare in Stockholm, but Hdm-sensitized children are now frequently observed, which probably indicates an increased infestation rate. This study was performed to elucidate determinants of Hdm sensitization in children living in the area. In a case-control study, 53 Hdm-sensitized children (cases), a group of non-Hdm-sensitized atopic children (N = 54), and a group of nonallergic neighborhood children (N = 53) were included. Mattress dust was analyzed with ELISA for content of Hdm allergens. Indoor humidity and temperature were measured, and questionnaire data were collected. Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was significantly more common in the Hdm-sensitized group than in the atopic control group. Hdm allergens were found in 40%, 19%, and 23% of the dust samples of the case group, atopic group, and neighborhood control groups, respectively. Only 15% of the dust samples of the Hdm-sensitized children contained Hdm allergens above the recommended threshold levels of sensitization of 2000 ng/gm of dust. Inadequate ventilation, which partly appeared to be a consequence of energy saving, appeared to be a risk factor for Hdm sensitization. This result may apply also to other temperate regions and suggests that the problem is preventable.

The recognition and control of occupational disease.Occupational diseases account each year in the United States for an estimated 50,000 to 70,000 deaths and 350,000 new cases of illness. Often, however, occupational diseases are not correctly diagnosed, because they mimic diseases due to other causes and because most physicians are not well trained in their recognition. Opportunities for prevention and treatment are therefore lost. The occupational history is the most effective means for proper Diagnosis_ASDPTO of occupational illness. It should routinely be obtained for every patient. A brief but systematic guide for obtaining an occupational history is presented in this report. Also, approaches are summarized for the recognition and Diagnosis_ASDPTO of such important occupational diseases as occupational Neoplasm_HP, asbestosis and other respiratory disorders, and occupational neuropsychologic disorders. The management and prevention of occupational diseases depend on reduction of hazardous Exposures_ASDPTO in the workplace and better education of workers, industrial managers, and physicians. This report outlines a program for the control of occupational disease based on (1) preventing Exposures_ASDPTO in the workplace, (2) premarket toxicity testing of new chemicals and technologies, and (3) astute clinical Diagnosis_ASDPTO.

[Suppressive effect of Saibokuto on Dermatophagoides farinae (Df) antigen-induced IL2 responsiveness of lymphocytes from Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic children].The effect of Saibokuto on induction of antigen specific IL2 responsiveness was studied. Saibokuto suppressed the induction of IL2 responsiveness induced by Dermatophagoides farinae (Df) antigen in Peripheral_HP blood mononuclear cells from patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Saibokuto-pretreated adherent cells failed to present Df antigen to non-adherent responding T cells for induction of their IL2 responsiveness. The same dose of Saibokuto had no impact on non-adherent cells. Saibokuto also suppressed the induced IL2 responsiveness of lymphocytes from the same patients on stimulation wit PPD, but not with Con A. These combined data suggests that Saibokuto has a weak immunosuppressive effect on Df induced IL2 responsiveness of lymphocytes from Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic children.

[Long-term follow-up studies of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in children. I. Prognosis and risk factors].A questionnaire on the prognosis of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was sent in 1988 to 1,592 patients (1,038 males, 554 females) averaging 20 years of age after 12 years' follow up. The results were as follows: 75.6% in remission, 18.2% improved, 4.0% unchanged, 0.9% worse and 1.3% dead from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The average Onset_HP was 2.7 years, about 1 year earlier than that in our report of 1965. The average age of remission (growing out of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP) was 13.0 years for males and 12.3 years for females. The prognosis was significantly poorer among Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics with an Onset_HP age of under 2 years, with a 10-year history of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP before the first visit to our hospital, with Severe_HP attack at the initial visit, a history of admissions for the attacks and Food_Allergy_HP. The Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic children with Food_Allergy_HP had a 1-year earlier Onset_HP of attack, a more Severe_HP attack at the initial visit, more Eczema_HP in infancy, and 2 or more other allergic complications than children without Food_Allergy_HP. We have to closely follow and care for those Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic children with high risk factors for an extended period.
[Long-term follow-up studies of bronchial asthma in children. I. Prognosis and risk factors].A questionnaire on the prognosis of bronchial asthma was sent in 1988 to 1,592 patients (1,038 males, 554 females) averaging 20 years of age after 12 years' follow up. The results were as follows: 75.6% in remission, 18.2% improved, 4.0% unchanged, 0.9% worse and 1.3% dead from asthma. The average age of onset was 2.7 years, about 1 year earlier than that in our report of 1965. The average age of remission (growing out of asthma) was 13.0 years for males and 12.3 years for females. The prognosis was significantly poorer among asthmatics with an onset age of under 2 years, with a 10-year history of asthma before the first visit to our hospital, with severe attack at the initial visit, a history of admissions for the attacks and food allergy. The asthmatic children with food allergy had a 1-year earlier onset of attack, a more severe attack at the initial visit, more eczema in infancy, and 2 or more other allergic complications than children without food allergy. We have to closely follow and care for those asthmatic children with high risk factors for an extended period.
[Mucociliary transport disturbance after an asthmatic attack].The influence of asthmatic attack on the mucociliary transport system was studied by saccharin test in 8 asthmatic patients. In Stable_HP asthmatics, the mean nasal clearance time (NCT) was 44.9 +/- 6.1 (SE) min, which was greater than in normal controls (15.1 +/- 3.4 (SE) min). Nasal clearance time in Stable_HP asthmatics correlated fairly well with the duration of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. There is, however, no relationship between NCT and ages, blood eosinophil counts, blood IgE, or the respiratory functions. Mean NCT during asthmatic attack was 16.9 min, but 1 week later, mean NCT was Prolonged_HP to 58.6 min and 101.1 min after 2 weeks. These results indicate that there is mucociliary transport disturbance after asthmatic attack.

Trends in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP mortality in New Zealand, 1908-1986.Trends in mortality from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in non-Maori New Zealanders aged 5 to 34 years were examined for the period 1908-1986. Two previously documented epidemics of death from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP occurred in the 1960s and the late 1970s. These epidemics are most likely to have been due to changes in the management of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP: the introduction of isoprenaline forte by metered dose inhaler in the 1960s and inhaled fenoterol in the 1970s. A previously unreported rise in mortality, which was more gradual in Onset_HP and less Severe_HP, occurred in the 1940s and 1950s; a similar pattern occurred in England and Wales during the same period. It is unlikely that this increase in mortality was solely due to changes in diagnostic fashion or disease coding. Possible explanations include changes in the management or prevalence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, or in environmental factors. It is notable that mortality was below 0.5 per 100,000 person-years prior to 1940, but has subsequently increased considerably. Thus, while modern methods for treating Asthma_ASDPTO_HP have improved the quality of life of many asthmatics, mortality has increased during the period of their introduction and use.

Mechanical ventilation of paediatric patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP: short and long term outcome.In the 7 years from 1982 to 1988, 10,639 children with Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were admitted to the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne. Of these, 262 children (2%) were treated in the Intensive Care Unit. Twenty-seven required mechanical ventilation on 34 occasions, being 0.3% of hospital Asthma_ASDPTO_HP admissions. Five patients died, four due to brain death following Respiratory_arrest_HP prior to intubation. The main complications were (i) barotrauma, which occurred in five patients on seven occasions (20%); (ii) a reversible Myopathy_HP which occurred in three patients treated with high dose corticosteroids and muscle relaxants. Follow-up of patients ventilated in intensive care revealed that all but one of the initial survivors was alive 1-5 years later, all patients required subsequent readmission to hospital for treatment of Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and 78% had persistent rather than Episodic_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Although uncommon, an episode of ventilation has a major impact on the family's understanding and future management of Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Platelet-activating factor (PAF) and PAF antagonists in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.PAF is produced by and activates inflammatory cells, such as monocytes/macrophages, mast cells, platelets, neutrophils, eosinophils and endothelial cells. Its ability to imitate Anaphylactic_shock_HP, inducing for instance bronchoconstriction (BC) in guinea-pigs, and its identification (and/or that of lyso-PAF) in exudates from shocked lungs, led to the hypothesis that PAF is involved in immediate hypersensitivity. Recent results of Bachelet et al. show that PAF reduces the increased cyclic AMP content of guinea-pig alveolar cell population exposed to PGE2, salbutamol or isoprenaline, which agrees with its hypothesized stimulating role in conditions where increased cyclic AMP may reduce mediator release. PAF antagonists are usually selected with in vitro platelet tests and their in vivo activity is characterized in normal animals. Recent data of Pretolani et al. demonstrate nevertheless that the antagonists may lose part of their ability to inhibit PAF itself if tested on lungs from actively sensitized guinea-pigs. These lungs differ from those of passively sensitized or of naive animals in that they become hyper-responsive to mediators (PAF, leukotriene D4 [LTD4], histamine, arachidonate [AA]): BC and formation of thromboxane A2 are enhanced, and histamine is released dose-dependently under conditions where it is absent from perfusates from LTD4, AA or PAF-stimulated naive lungs. Peripheral_HP inflammatory cells (basophils, eosinophils, monocytes) are possibly recruited into the lungs of the actively sensitized animals sometime during the second and/or third week of sensitization, and provide a new target which may account for the enhanced lung responsiveness. Ultra-structural studies of Lellouch-Tubiana et al. (abstract in this meeting) support this concept. Neither the primary target nor the chemotactic substance responsible for the reported modifications are identified, but recent data of Bachelet et al, showing that alveolar populations from actively sensitized guinea-pigs are less responsive to the cyclic AMP stimulating effects of PGE2, salbutamol or isoprenaline suggest the existence of a cell defect which may be important for the triggering of allergen-induced BC and cell recruitment. Our present concept involves a "pre-inflamed" lung in actively sensitized guinea-pigs and in human asthmatics, a stand-by process following sensitization and which is revealed following the activation of a target cell. This may be the alveolar macrophage which releases substances (PAF, TXA2, IL1) likely to start BC and protracted cell recruitment and activation.

Epithelium-derived inhibitory factor in human bronchus.The potencies of histamine and methacholine were significantly increased by approximately 2- and 5-fold respectively in human non-diseased isolated bronchi on removal of the epithelium. In contrast, no increases in spasmogen potency were observed following epithelium removal in bronchi obtained from a sample of asthmatic human lung. The failure of epithelium removal to increase asthmatic bronchial sensitivity to histamine may have been due to a reduction in the release of an epithelium-derived inhibitory factor (EpDIF) resulting from disease-induced epithelial damage. A co-Axial_HP bioassay system in which endothelium-denuded rat aorta was used as the assay tissue was used to detect the release of a vasorelaxant EpDIF from human bronchial tissue. Histamine (100 microM) and methacholine (25 microM), in the presence of indomethacin (5 microM), reduced phenylephrine-induced tone in endothelium-denuded rat aorta in co-Axial_HP assemblies by 75 +/- 11 and 67 +/- 9% respectively. Removal of the bronchial epithelium abolished these responses, indicating that they were mediated by an EpDIF. It is possible that human airway smooth muscle is sensitive to this vasorelaxant EpDIF and that the absence of the source of this factor following epithelium removal caused the increases in sensitivity to spasmogens. Alternatively, the human bronchial epithelium may also release an EpDIF selective for airway smooth muscle.

[Clinical and patho-morphological evaluation of patients dying from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].Mortality from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP within 1978-1987 was analysed retrospectively. This analysis included selected factors determining the mortality in this disease. Some conditions being able to decrease death risk in Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients were defined. The results of autopsies of patients who died from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were also analysed with an attempt to interpret those results basing on the selected clinical data. Unified scheme of sampling for pathomorphological examinations was proposed together with proper interpretation of histopathologies in the lungs and myocardium. Presented data are preliminary and will be continued in foreseen prospective studies.

[T and B lymphocytes and serum alpha 1-antitrypsin activity in children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP treated with broncho-vaxom].The aim of this study was to evaluate an effect of Broncho-Vaxom treatment on T and B lymphocytes and serum alpha 1AT in children treated at "Zuch" sanatorium in Szczawno-spa. The trial involved 46 school aged children suffering from infectious or infectious-atopic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The post-Broncho-Vaxom treatment values for T lymphocytes were significantly higher in infectious, and significantly lower for B lymphocytes in infectious-atopic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Serum alpha 1AT activity in children suffering from infectious Asthma_ASDPTO_HP decreased significantly after the treatment. A correlation between the efficacy of the treatment and the lymphocyte percentage was observed. In children with very effective clinical results of Broncho-Vaxom treatment, the significant increase in T lymphocyte, and decrease in B lymphocyte populations was observed. Changes in T and B lymphocyte percentage were analysed in respect to alpha 1AT pre-treatment activity. In children with high alpha 1AT value, T lymphocytes after the treatment increased significantly in infectious, and B lymphocytes decreased significantly in infectious-atopic group.

[Ten years of experience with specific desensitization in children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].Hundred eighty five children, aged between 6 and 15 years, with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and diagnosed Allergy_HP to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus were followed-up for 2-3 years between 1978 and 1988. Children were treated with HDM vaccine Bencard. Administered doses were increased gradually at the beginning of therapy whereas they remained the same for further 1-3 years. Excellent and favourable results were achieved in 78.4% of cases. The treatment as postponed in 36 children (19.4%) because of the lack of improvement after one year of the follow-up. Easily manageable adverse reactions and complications were seen in 4 patients (2.2%).

[Three month treatment with budesonide in patients with corticoid dependent Asthma_ASDPTO_HP--personal experience].The experiment aimed at evaluating a three-month therapy of Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients with budesonide inhalations. The study involved 32 patients with long-lasting Asthma_ASDPTO_HP depended on steroids. Therapy with budesonide (Pulmicort Astra) in a mean daily dose 1.6 mg enabled withdrawal of depot steroids and inhalation treatment only. In patients receiving prednisone in a mean daily dose 5.0 +/- 4.8 mg, budesonide therapy enabled a reduction of the oral dose by 50 percent. A significant improvement in the psychophysical status of patients has been noted despite a lack of significant differences in the results of lung functioning tests. Adverse reactions such as relaxation, insufficiency of the vocal cords at phonation and Hoarse_voice_HP were seen in 20 percent of patients, and in one of them required cessation of the drug. An increase in the number of Candida albicans colonies in throat swabs (over 20 colonies per plate) was seen in 7 treated patients but clinical symptoms which required an additional treatment were noted only in 1 patient.

[The Asthma_ASDPTO_HP-Gastroesophageal_reflux_HP association].The Gastroesophageal_reflux_HP acts as a trigger mechanism in the induction of a Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic attack, either as an aggravating or a releasing factor. Our study was underwent on 15 out of 100 followed up Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients who did not respond to the usual treatments and demonstrated the usual treatments and demonstrated the intervention of the Gastroesophageal_reflux_HP. Its presence was suggested clinically by the symptoms (pyrosis, Dysphagia_HP, acid regurgitations) and confirmed in 5 patients by the barium examination in Trendelenburg and in the remainder of 10 by the esophageal pH, determination of gastroesophageal motility and endoscopic examination. Excepting the known allergenic conditions, the attacks were recorded during night or postprandially, being usually preceded by the above mentioned symptoms. The antispastic and antisecretory treatment improved the respiratory symptoms. The recognition of this association, i.e. Asthma_ASDPTO_HP-Gastroesophageal_reflux_HP, has a practical importance, the intervention of the esophageal component leading to the termination of the attacks.

[Clear definitions of Chronic_HP bronchopulmonary diseases: a necessity for practice, teaching and research in pneumology].Important divergences in the definition of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, Chronic_HP Bronchitis_HP and Emphysema_HP have persisted until the middle 1950's. Definitions were first standardized in 1958 by a group of British specialists (CIBA symposium) and made more accurate by the WHO Experts Group on Cor_pulmonale_HP in 1961 and by the American Thoracic Society in 1962. The standardized questionnaire proposed by the British Medical Research Council has been widely adopted. As regards Emphysema_HP, a precise definition based on anatomical data (Dilatation_HP of terminal air spaces with destruction of their walls) has been accepted. For lack of a better basis, Chronic_HP Bronchitis_HP is defined in clinical terms (almost daily Productive_Cough_HP 3 months each year, at least on 2 consecutive years); the terms "Chronic_HP Cough_HP" and "Recurrent_HP Bronchitis_HP" are still controverted. The greatest difficulties have been encountered in the definition of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP; despite a second CIBA symposium (1971) devoted to this problem, it has not been possible to improve on the fairly wide physiological definition put forward in 1958 (bronchial obstruction that varies either spontaneously or under the influence of treatment). For about 15 years Peripheral_HP airways obstruction (PAO), sometimes called "small airways disease" has been recognized as a special anatomical and functional syndrome.

As regards pulmonary emphysema, a precise definition based on anatomical data (dilatation of terminal air spaces with destruction of their walls) has been accepted. For lack of a better basis, chronic bronchitis is defined in clinical terms (almost daily productive cough 3 months each year, at least on 2 consecutive years); the terms "chronic cough" and "recurrent bronchitis" are still controverted. The greatest difficulties have been encountered in the definition of bronchial asthma; despite a second CIBA symposium (1971) devoted to this problem, it has not been possible to improve on the fairly wide physiological definition put forward in 1958 (bronchial obstruction that varies either spontaneously or under the influence of treatment). For about 15 years peripheral airways obstruction (PAO), sometimes called "small airways disease" has been recognized as a special anatomical and functional syndrome.
[Role of intrathoracic pressure in changes in the greater and lesser circulation hemodynamics in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].The greater and lesser circulation hemodynamics was examined in 59 patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and 23 controls by tetrapolar rheography, kinetocardiography, and ultrasonic Doppler cardiography. Simultaneously measurements of intrathoracic pressure (ITP) were carried out with an esophageal controller. Reduced Stroke_HP index, increased total Peripheral_HP resistance of the vessels, and elevated systolic pressure in the pulmonary artery were revealed in the patients as against the controls. ITP values in Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics surpassed twofold those in the reference group. To reveal elevated ITP effects on the hemodynamics, the authors have examined the hemodynamic parameters during Valsalva's test (with elevation of oral pressure up to 25-35 mm Hg) in 16 reference subjects. The results evidence the leading role of elevated ITP on the greater and lesser circulation hemodynamics in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Elevated ITP lowers the venous blood flow to the heart and reduces the preload thus decreasing the blood flow to the lesser circulation and not increasing the pulmonary artery systolic pressure.

[Comparative characteristics of rhino- and laryngo-bronchial reflexes in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].Modern methods of evaluating the status of upper airways (total body plethysmography, acetylcholine and cold tests) were applied to give a comparative characterization of rhino- and laryngo-bronchial++ reflexes. Altogether 157 patients were examined: 20 patients with polypous rhinosinusitis, 15 with Laryngeal_stenosis_HP, 35 with nascent Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, and 87 with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The findings helped to isolate, among the patients with upper airways pathologies, a risk group susceptible to Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

[Osteoporosis_HP caused by long-term steroid therapy of patients with Chronic_HP asthmatic Bronchitis_HP].14 patients with Chronic_HP Bronchitis_HP were observed after from 1.5 to 8 years of regular treatment with corticosteroids of sustained action given intramuscularly. The patients were analysed from the standpoint of age, sex, duration of corticosteroid treatment, type and dose of the drugs, and Smoking_ASDPTO. In 9 of them accelerated development of Osteoporosis_HP was noted its appearance depended significantly only on age and sex.

Plasma exudation in tracheobronchial and nasal airways: a mucosal defence mechanism becomes pathogenic in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Rhinitis_HP.Plasma exudation into airway tissue and lumen is a defence and inflammatory reaction. If exaggerated it may become pathogenic as in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Rhinitis_HP. Exuded plasma contains an abundance of mediators (kinins, complement fragments, fibrinolysis- and coagulation-peptides etc.) which have direct inflammatory and obstructive actions and which can attract, prime, and activate inflammatory cells. The plasma exudate may cause airway hyperresponsiveness by increasing mucosal thickness. In the lumen the exuded plasma is added to irritant and viscous secretions and plugs. AntiAsthma_ASDPTO_HP and antirhinitic drugs, including glucocorticoids, disodium cromoglycate, beta-adrenoceptor agonists and xanthines, have anti-exudative actions that may include a direct reduction of vascular permeability and other anti-inflammatory effects. Recent data with nasal and tracheobronchial airways in guinea-pigs and humans suggest that plasma can pass into the airway lumen without disturbing the integrity of the epithelial lining as a barrier to inhaled molecules. Potent proteins from circulating plasma can, thus, promptly appear on the surface of a normal mucosa to neutralize offending materials. It is proposed that plasma exudation must be considered a first line mucosal defence system along with mucociliary transport in the airways.

Vascular beds in the airways of normal subjects and asthmatics.In humans a rich network of capillaries runs subepithelially from the Central_HP airways to the level of the Peripheral_HP bronchioles, where it anastomoses with the alveolar capillaries. The tracheobronchial capillaries converge to form venules extending to a deeper plexus of larger venules and arterioles. Transmission electronmicroscopy shows capillaries very close to the epithelial basement membrane, but not in the epithelium itself. There are two main differences in the bronchial mucosal vascular bed between Healthy_HP controls and asthmatics. In 60% of asthmatics there are endothelial gaps in the bronchial mucosal microvasculature compared to none in controls. Half of asthmatics have eosinophils adhered in the bronchial mucosal venules and capillaries, but none are seen in controls. Neutrophils are even more common than eosinophils in the bronchial mucosal capillaries and venules, but they are also found in the venules of one control out of four. The finding of inflammatory cells in the bronchial vessels suggests possible chemotaxis in asthmatics.

Bronchoconstriction of the asthmatic airway by inhaled and ingested propranolol.Responsiveness to inhaled histamine and DL propranolol hydrochloride was measured in 31 adult asthmatics and compared with bronchoconstriction provoked by Acute_HP oral propranolol dosing (max 160 mg). Twelve asthmatics developed greater than or equal to 15% reduction in the forced expired volume in 1 s (FEV1), 2 h after less than or equal to 100 mg oral propranolol; cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blockade was confirmed by cycle exercise tests in the 19 without airway response. The provocative inhaled dose of each aerosol causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20) was lower, histamine 0.43 mg.ml-1, propranolol 3.12 mg.ml-1, in the 12 with a positive oral test compared with the 19 with a negative test, PC20 histamine 1.65 mg.ml-1, PC20 propranolol 16.2 mg.ml-1 (P less than 0.001 for both aerosols). A correlation was demonstrated between the PC20 values for asthmatics with a negative oral test (r = 0.72, P less than 0.001, n = 19) but not for the remainder (r = 0.14, P greater than 0.05, n = 12). Plasma propranolol concentrations (CL, ng.ml-1) after the final oral dose did not correlate with the % delta FEV1 (26.3) (r = -0.28) when an airway response was provoked or with the reduction in exercise Tachycardia_HP (25.9%) (r = 0.31) when no bronchoconstriction occurred. CL exceeded the limit of detection after the final inhaled propranolol dose (7.5 ng.ml-1) and was weakly related to the PC20 propranolol value (r = 0.53, P = 0.01, n = 27). The prevalence of a positive oral challenge was low in this group (39%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Allergen-induced increase in airway responsiveness and inflammation in Mild_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The relationship between airway responsiveness to methacholine and inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was determined in patients with history of Rhinitis_HP and/or Mild_HP bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP either at baseline (10 patients) or 3-4 h after allergen inhalation challenge (11 patients). At baseline, airway responsiveness did not correlate with any BAL cell population. When data obtained after allergen challenge were included in the analysis, 44% of the variability of airway responsiveness was explained by a multiple regression model with BAL eosinophils as a directly correlated (P = 0.002) independent variable and with BAL macrophages as an inversely correlated (P = 0.045) independent variable. Changes in airway responsiveness after allergen challenge were predicted (82% of variance explained) by a model with BAL eosinophils and BAL lymphocytes as directly correlated (P = 0.0002 and P = 0.03, respectively) independent variables. We conclude that, in Stable_HP asymptomatic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, baseline airway responsiveness does not correlate with the presence in the airways of inflammatory and immunoeffector cells that can be recovered by BAL. Nevertheless the allergen-induced increase in airway responsiveness is associated with an influx of eosinophils and lymphocytes in the bronchial lumen.

[Fibrinolysis, immune reactivity and the structure of the blood serum albumin in Obstructive_lung_disease_HPs combined with Atherosclerosis_HP].Fibrinolytic system, immune reactivity and isoelectric focusing of serum albumin were examined in 94 patients exhibiting combination of Obstructive_lung_disease_HP (Chronic_HP obstructive Bronchitis_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP) with Atherosclerosis_HP. Plasminogen activator showed discrete activity, the discreteness being less in Respiratory_distress_HP of the I degree but higher in the distress of the II and III degree. Relative number of E-RFC and monocytes expressing receptors to IgM and IgG Fc-fragment decreased. Percentage of EAC-RFC rose. Serum albumin fractions changed pH range due to modification of albumin molecules resultant from forming complexes with fibrinogen degradation products. Concentration of the latter under conditions of Respiratory_distress_HP induced by Obstructive_lung_disease_HPs associated with Atherosclerosis_HP substantially exceeded the standard levels.

A case of hyperdopaminuria due to increased renal dopamine production.Increasing evidence suggests that dopamine is synthesized within the kidney and that this intrarenally formed dopamine plays a role in sodium handling. We report on a case, in which a patient had markedly Elevated_urinary_dopamine_HP levels, due to increased renal dopamine synthesis, while receiving Chronic_HP corticosteroid therapy. Blockade of the renal dopamine synthesis, by carbidopa, markedly reduced urinary dopamine output and urinary sodium excretion. These findings provide further evidence for the hypothesis that intrarenal dopamine plays a role in sodium handling and may be of pathophysiological importance in counteracting the sodium-retaining effects of Chronic_HP corticosteroid therapy.

The Allergy_HP management of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in children in Surabaya.The Allergy_HP management of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP consists of avoidance of exposure to allergens either inhalant, or ingestant, hyposensitization in cases where complete avoidance is impossible and drug therapy is needed. The diet initiated in allergic children is principally a diagnostic tool. There are two important diet regimens. First, "The Elimination Diet", indicated in patients to exclude major allergenic foods such as fruit, milk, egg, fish, and peanut. Secondly, "The Minimal Diet" (Modified Rowe's Diet), consisting of several foods "allowed" such as water, rice, coconut, beef, soy-cake, soy sauce, spinach, carrot, garlic and onion, salt and sugar, while other foods are prohibited. To obtain clear improvement of symptoms, the diet must be continued for 3 weeks. If improvement occurs, a challenge can be performed. All previously Excluded_HP foods can be reinstituted one at a time in a sufficient amount, every day for one week. If no symptoms appear, the food can be considered as non allergenic to the patient. If symptoms reappear, the food should be suspected as causing the Allergy_HP. For Diagnosis_ASDPTO, three challenges are required. Pharmacologic therapy is initiated with ephedrine and chlortrimeton as needed. Aminophylline and beta 2 agonist may be given as a substitute if the former drugs fail to relieve the symptoms. Intravenous aminophylline and corticosteroid are used especially in "status Asthma_ASDPTO_HPticus".

Corticosteroid inhalation in the treatment of childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Inhaled corticosteroids are a dramatic advance in the therapy of Chronic_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Corticosteroid inhalation therapy in children offers the same advantages over oral medication as in adults. Inhaled corticosteroids have better effects compared with other prophylactic antiAsthma_ASDPTO_HP therapy such as theophylline, sodium cromoglycate and ketotifen. However, it is obvious that inhaled corticosteroids are not completely free of side effects, both topical and systemic such as suppression of HPA, Growth_delay_HP, Osteoporosis_HP, Cataract_HP formation, blood count and immunoglobulin changes, oropharyngeal candidiasis and Dysphonia_HP. Recently, many clinicians have been using this effective and save treatment more freely and for longterm administration.

[Extracorporeal elimination of CO2 as a component of the intensive therapy of Status_asthmaticus_HP].The first industrial Soviet membrane oxygenator "MOCT-122" was used for extracorporeal CO2 elimination lasting for several (up to 24) hours, in 4 patients with Severe_HP asthmatic status. This led to Hypercapnia_HP liquidation and optimization of an intensive regimen of controlled lung ventilation, which made it possible to perform effective tracheobronchial lavage in the most favourable conditions. No complications of assisted veno-venous perfusion have been observed as a result of therapeutic procedures performed. Third degree asthmatic status was arrested in all the patients and they were discharged from hospital in a satisfactory condition.

[Delayed reaction in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].IgE mediated type 1 hypersensitivity induces an immediate phase, during the minutes that follow contact with the allergen and is very often associated with a late phase that occurs during the hours that follow contact. The late phase of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP induced by an IgE--dependent mechanism is linked with a cellular activation (lymphocytes, eosinophils) and release of different mediators (Paf Acether, LTB4, ECFA, MBP, EcP) from those of the immediate phase. Corticosteroids are well known as inhibitors of the late phase. Like cromoglycate, AZELASTINE inhibits both the immediate and late phases.

Responses of asthmatic and non-asthmatic athletes to Prolonged_HP treadmill running.Metabolic and cardio-respiratory responses of four asthmatic and four non-asthmatic athletes to two hours of treadmill running at 70 percent of maximal oxygen uptake are compared. The asthmatic group had pre-exercise airflow obstruction, as indicated by the lower forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) even after medication (2.90 +/- 0.661) compared to the non-asthmatic group (4.09 +/- 1.331). Changes in blood lactate, glucose and catecholamine concentrations as a result of the two hour run were similar for the two groups. However, the pattern of breathing was different. The asthmatics had a slower breathing Frequency_HP but a similar tidal volume to the non-asthmatics. Both groups had an increase in the ventilation rate over the two hour run. For the non-asthmatic group, this increase in ventilation was achieved by an increase in the breathing Frequency_HP (p less than 0.01), whereas tidal volume was reduced (p less than 0.05). The increase in the ventilation rate over the two hour run for the asthmatic group was brought about by a small increase in breathing Frequency_HP (p less than 0.05), whereas tidal volume was not changed. This maintenance of the tidal volume by the asthmatic athletes during endurance running may compensate for the airflow obstruction, and so allow successful participation in endurance running.

Ethnicity as a possible factor contributing to the development of Chronic_HP airflow limitation and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Race or ethnicity have occasionally been cited as possible factors contributing to the risk of developing Obstructive_lung_disease_HP. In a hospital based case-control study of Caucasian patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP or Chronic_HP airflow limitation (CAL), we determined the Frequency_HP of each of five major European ethnic groups in the patients. We then compared the two patient groups to each other and to the frequencies reported by Canada Census and found significant differences in their ethnic constitution. Our results suggest that the British are more likely than other groups, especially North Eastern Europeans, to develop CAL, while North Eastern Europeans and Scandinavians are more likely to develop Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. These differences could be due to genetic differences among the various groups or to environmental factors associated with particular ethnic groups. They suggest that ethnicity is an additional factor to consider in future epidemiological studies of CAL or Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

[Psychotherapy in atopic diseases].Atopic diseases show many attributes and risk factors of psychosomatic diseases. The skin, on of our most essential organ of senses, is of considerable importance in the "dermatogenic state" of psychological and social development, as well as breathing. Children with Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP bronchiale are very sensible and Irritability_HP. They divert their sick identity to the skin or to the lungs. Psychotherapy is therefore for many cases of atopic children and essential part of treatment, especially as a systemic therapy.

[Alternative treatment possibilities of atopic diseases].Families of children with atopic diseases often seek so-called alternative treatment as supplementation, not as real alternative to clinical medicine (complementary instead of alternative treatment). Clinical studies on the efficiency of acupuncture in the treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP gave contradictory results. The author's own uncontrolled experience in Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic children using a simple acupuncture scheme is rather good and a controlled clinical trial seems justified. In Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP treatment comprises a mixture of acupuncture, homeopathy and dietary regimes and the therapeutic results have to be viewed against the possibility of spontaneous remissions. A controlled clinical trial seems impossible.

[Specific immune therapy].The results of specific immuno-therapy are very satisfactory in Allergic_Rhinitis_HP and insect venom Allergies_ASDPTO (80-95%), less effective in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (60%) in cases of combined intrinsic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Side effects can be avoided by using standardized allergen vaccines, with a premedication of antihistaminesca and with limitation of the maximal dose.

Side effects can be avoided by using standardized allergen vaccines, with a premedication of antihistaminesca and with limitation of the maximal dose.
[Severe_HP anaphylactoid reactions after intravenous corticosteroids. Report of a case and review of the literature].We report a case of fatal anaphylactic reaction to intravenous methylprednisolone succinate therapy developed in a 51 year old asthmatic man with aspirin intolerance and undetermined Myocarditis_HP. 14 similar cases were found in literature and analysed: Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and aspirin intolerance seem to be risk factors; the organism reacts against either unconjugated corticoid or esterified corticoid principally its succinate salt; the mechanism of these reactions remains not clear; it may be either a true allergic reaction or a non specific reaction.

[The rehabilitation of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP patients at a polyclinic].A study of 299 patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP indicates that it is of importance to include breathing with positive pressure at expiration in the complex of the rehabilitation program. Broncholytics are recommended in patients with average Severe_HP and Severe_HP course during exacerbation with consideration of circadian rhythms of bronchial patency. Positive-pressure breathing allows to reduce the maintenance dose of berotek by 29% and theopek by 31%.

[The effect of vilozen on the immune status of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP patients].An immunological study of 163 patients with different forms of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP revealed a distinct disturbance of the cellular link of immunity in these patients. Vilosen (a native non-protein immunomodulator extracted from the thymus of animals) possessing a prevailing action on T-cells was used for correction of the immune disorders. It was found that vilosen proved effective in the complex treatment of patients with atopic associated forms of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Airway hyperreactivity, an introduction.Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is characterized by the presence of airway inflammation and an increased responsiveness to many different stimuli. The hyperresponsiveness to indirect stimuli such as adenosine, bradykinin, neuropeptides, sulphur dioxide suggest that the hyperresponsiveness in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP results from the complex interaction between inflammatory cells, neurons and smooth muscle cells. Several mechanisms may be involved in the influence of airway inflammation on airway responsiveness: increased mucosa permeability: enhanced exposure of irritant receptors, modulation of airway smooth muscle behavior by inflammatory mediators, mucosal Edema_HP, enhanced release of neurotransmitters, increased local reflex activity, decreased breakdown of neurotransmitters, etc. We have investigated the interaction between airway inflammation and responsiveness in two animal models: Acute_HP exposure to endotoxin and Chronic_HP exposure to aerosolized antigen. Both models demonstrate the complexity of interaction between inflammatory processes and demonstrate positive controlling mechanisms that inhibit the increase in airway responsiveness due to airway inflammation. The lack of such controlling mechanisms may be involved in the development of the asthmatic airway hyperresponsiveness.

Cytokines and bronchial hyperreactivity.Cytokines and interleukins are a potent group of molecules that is primarily involved in maintaining homeostasis. These molecules regulate the growth and function of many cells of the immune system including eosinophils, mast cells/basophils and others. Activation of the later cells by cytokines may play a crucial role in the development of allergic inflammation of the airways. The importance of cytokines in the pathogenesis of bronchial hyperreactivity and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP has been reviewed in this paper.

Putative role of epithelial derived factors in airway smooth muscle reactivity.Until recently the contractile actions of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP mediators have been examined in vitro without consideration of the modulatory role of the associated epithelial cells. Removal of the epithelium in vitro augments contraction and reduces relaxation to several bronchoactive agents and bioassay experiments have shown that the protective effects of the epithelium can be transferred to denuded preparations. It now seems likely that one or more epithelial-associated factors eg EpDRF and PGE2 have a protective role in controlling airway contractility. These findings may be important in asthmatics in vivo since there may be some correlation between epithelial damage/loss and airway hyperreactivity. The identity of EpDRF remains unknown but it does not appear to be a prostanoid and is distinct pharmacologically from EDRF found in blood vessels.

Plasticisers, another burden for Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics?The widely used plasticiser di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) has been reported to have some toxicological effects on pulmonary tissue. Inhalation of DEHP may cause Pulmonary_Edema_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Moreover intravenous injection of DEHP induces pulmonary inflammation and hemorrhage of the lungs. We now report that DEHP might cause bronchial hyperresponsiveness. The metabolite of DEHP mono(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (MEHP) induces in vitro a dose-dependent increase in -log EC50 for methacholine dose response curves in rat tracheal tissue. Moreover MEHP induces a decrease in maximal effect of the methacholine dose response curve. We concluded that DEHP due to the formation of MEHP in vivo, may cause bronchial hyperresponsiveness.

The Mood_ASDPTO-peak flow relationship in adult asthmatics: a pilot study of individual differences and direction of causality.The relationship between Mood_ASDPTO and peak flow (PEF) was examined in 10 adult asthmatics by taking twice daily readings over 15 days. Three subjects showed a clear overall Mood_ASDPTO-PEF relationship but this effect was attributable to recordings taken in the evening and not those taken in the morning. The size of the Mood_ASDPTO-PEF relationship correlated significantly with the percentage difference between morning and evening PEF. The results are discussed in terms of the direction of causality between Mood_ASDPTO and PEF and the need to examine individual differences in the Mood_ASDPTO-PEF relationship.

[Potentiating effect of spirometric maneuver on bronchial responsiveness to methacholine in asthmatic subjects--the role of deep inspiration and forced expiration].We previously reported that spirometric maneuver (SM) had potentiating effect on bronchial responsiveness (BR) in asthmatic subjects but not in normal subjects. SM consists of deep inspiration to TLC (DI) and forced expiration to RV (FE). In this study, we examined the effect of SM, DI and FE on BR in 9 asthmatic subjects. Provocative concentration of methacholine producing a 35% fall in respiratory conductance (PC35-Grs) was significantly (p less than 0.02 and p less than 0.025) decreased from 0.34 mg/ml (GSEM, 1.51) to 0.16 mg/ml (GSEM, 1.45) and 0.14 mg/ml (GSEM, 1.51) by SM and DI, respectively but it was not altered by FE. These findings indicate that potentiating effect of SM on BR which is characteristic of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP may be due to DI effect.

The presence of hypodense eosinophilic granulocytes in allergic children.To evaluate hypodense eosinophils known very little in children, Peripheral_HP blood from asthmatic, allergic-non-asthmatic and non-allergic children was evaluated by density Percoll gradient techniques. A significantly higher number of eosinophils were hypodense in asthmatic children (n = 24) compared with allergic non-asthmatic (n = 10) and non-allergic children (n = 13), namely 484 +/- 348 cells/40 microliters versus 113 +/- 109 and 39 +/- 61 (p less than 0.001) respectively. We also observed by light and electron microscopy that the hypodense eosinophils of asthmatic children were swollen and their granules were dispersed, but the normodense eosinophils of the same patient were small and compact. In three cases of Severe_HP asthmatic attack, hypodense eosinophils found on admission decreased in number after intravenous aminophylline therapy and relief of symptoms. Moreover, a decreased number of hypodense eosinophils were found in seven cases of allergic children (p less than 0.05) after 2 weeks of anti-allergic drug treatment associated with relieved symptoms. From these data we concluded that the presence of hypodense eosinophils in the Peripheral_HP blood might be related to the development of allergic symptoms and might participate in the pathophysiology of allergic diseases in children.

Salicylate pre-treatment attenuates Severity_HP of bronchial and nasal symptoms precipitated by aspirin in aspirin-intolerant patients.Aspirin (ASA) and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which are cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors, precipitate asthmatic attacks in ASA-intolerant patients, while sodium salicylate, hardly active on COX by itself, is well tolerated by these patients. However, salicylate moiety appears to interfere with aspirin inhibitory action on platelets and vascular COX. Such interaction, if present at the level of respiratory tract, may be of interest to pathogenesis of ASA-induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over study on the effect of choline magnesium trisalicylate (CMT, trilisate) pre-treatment on ASA-induced adverse reactions in nine patients. Pulmonary function tests, nasal symptoms score, PNIF and serum salicylate levels were monitored following challenges with threshold doses of ASA. Trilisate administered at a dose of 3000 mg daily for 3 days, offered a Moderate_HP protection against ASA-induced symptoms; it diminished the Severity_HP and/or delayed the appearance of FEV1 fall. Maximal decreases in FEV1 as well as reaction Severity_HP indexes were significantly lower (P less than 0.02 and P less than 0.002, respectively) after trilisate pre-treatment as compared to placebo. Trilisate also attenuated nasal symptoms in three out of five patients. Although the precise mechanism of the protective action of trilisate is unknown, our data support the possibility of interaction between salicylate and ASA on cyclo-oxygenase locus in the respiratory tract in ASA-intolerant patients.

The inflammatory response in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP exacerbation: changes in circulating eosinophils, basophils and their progenitors.Circulating eosinophils, basophils and eosinophil/basophil (Eo/B) progenitors were examined in 12 patients at the time of an exacerbation of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP accompanied by Sputum_Eosinophilia_HP and after resolution of the exacerbation with inhaled corticosteroid treatment. Differential counts were performed and Peripheral_HP blood non-adherent mononuclear cells were cultured for 14 days in methyl-cellulose to determine the number of Eo/B and granulocyte-macrophage (GM) colonies without knowledge of the clinical conditions or findings. With resolution of the Asthma_ASDPTO_HP exacerbation on beclomethasone therapy, there were significant Falls_HP in circulating eosinophils, basophils and Eo/B colonies whereas GM colonies were unchanged. To elucidate whether the observed changes could be due to systemic absorption or local action of inhaled corticosteroid, seven subjects with Allergic_Rhinitis_HP and no current evidence of lower airway inflammation (no symptoms of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and normal methacholine airway responsiveness) received 14 days' treatment with the same dose of inhaled beclomethasone or of placebo in a double-blind randomized cross-over study. No significant changes in airway function or in circulating cell counts were observed. The results suggest reduced production of eosinophils and basophils after the resolution of an exacerbation of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. This effect may be due to reduced levels of airway-derived eosinophil-basophil growth and differentiation factors.

Plasmapheresis in a patient with Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP associated with auto-antibodies to platelets.Although the pathogenesis of aspirin-sensitive Asthma_ASDPTO_HP remains to be specified, it is known that in the presence of acetylsalicylic acid or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, platelets from aspirin-sensitive asthmatics have been described as generating cytocidal mediators that killed parasite targets such as Schistosoma mansoni larvae. Here we report, in a patient with corticosteroid-dependent Asthma_ASDPTO_HP associated with aspirin sensitivity, the presence of circulating IgE antibodies against 55 kD and 68 kD platelet antigens. In addition, the serum from this patient was shown to contain a factor able to trigger the release of cytocidal mediators from his platelets as well as from normal individual platelets. This platelet stimulatory activity was presumably supported by IgE antibodies or immune complexes. After informed consent the patient was submitted to plasma exchanges. Plasma removal induced clinical improvement, anti-Platelet_antibody_positive_HP decrease, and the reduction of the platelet stimulatory activity. All clinical symptoms disappeared within 2 weeks. The disease remained quiescent for 2 months, and daily requirements for prednisone (20-5 mg), and beta-agonist (10-16 to 0-1 inhalations) could be kept at a low level follow-up. The plasma exchanges were delayed by 3 mg kg-1 azathioprine with the maintenance of clinical improvement. A relapse occurred after the arrest of immunosuppressive therapy with the reappearance of both Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attacks and anti-platelet antibodies, as well as the increase of the platelet stimulatory activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP at Kenyatta National Hospital, Nairobi.Between January 1986 and July 1988, 356 children with bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP below 14 years of age were evaluated at the Kenyatta National Hospital. 21.3% experienced initial asthmatic attacks before the age of six months and 55.1% before 2 years. Only 8% of the study patients were below the age of 2 years at recruitment. The male:female ratio was 1:1. Physical exercise led to precipitation or worsening of attacks in 43.4% while 71.6% of the patients experienced attacks in the evening or at night. 18.5% and 42.9% had personal history of Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP and Allergic_Rhinitis_HP respectively. The study shows that a substantial number of patients experience initial asthmatic attacks before the age of 6 months contrary to what has been previously believed.

Pulmonary function parameters in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP patients receiving oral ketotifen.Ketotifen, an antianaphylactic and antihistamine drug was given orally to 31 Asthma_ASDPTO_HP patients who had significant airflow limitation (mean FEV1% FVC = 65.1). 19 patients had extrinsic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and 12 patients had intrinsic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Ketotifen was given in a dose of 1 mg twice daily for 16 weeks. At the end of this period, concomitant medication, Frequency_HP and Severity_HP of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attacks and mean lung function test results were analysed. The number of Acute_HP asthmatic attacks were reduced significantly from a mean of 7.1 attacks/week before treatment to 0.28 attacks/week after 16 weeks of treatment (P less than 0.001). The Severity_HP of attacks and the need to use concomitant bronchodilators agents were also reduced. Lung function improved following oral ketotifen administration as indicated by changes in FVC, FEV1, FEV1% FVC and PEF. FVC increased insignificantly (18.64 ml/week, P less than 0.3), while FEV1, FEV1% FVC and PEF improved significantly (33.45 ml/week, 0.76%/week and 5.52 l/min/week respectively, P less than 0.01). It was concluded that the relief which is often observed in patients suffering from bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP on ketotifen therapy is associated with an improvement in the lung function. Hence, ketotifen is effective in the prophylaxis of both extrinsic and intrinsic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

The efficacy and safety of a controlled release formulation of salbutamol in the management of patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in Nairobi, Kenya.The treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in Africa is influenced by cultural and environmental factors as well as the availability of drugs. Poor compliance with regard to long-term maintenance treatment of Chronic_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is also a problem in Africa. The present study reports on 45 patients from 2 centres in Nairobi treated with 8 mg twice daily of an oral controlled release formulation of salbutamol ("Volmax"). The treatment produced a significant improvement in lung function measured by the PEFR compared with baseline data on previous therapy. Controlled release salbutamol was rated as effective or very effective by 84.2% of patients and for 81.6% of patients their physicians preferred this preparation to the therapy used before the study. Side effects were infrequent and usually occurred during the first few days of treatment. The study which is the first report in Africa to assess this novel formulation of salbutamol in a group of African patients, demonstrates that controlled release salbutamol 8 mg administered twice daily is safe and effective, offering benefits over current therapies in the treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Bronchodilator effect of terbutaline aerosol in Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic: comparison of two spacer devices.The degree of bronchodilation achieved with aerosolised bronchodilators may partly depend on correct usage of a particular inhaler device. The effect of two puffs of 0.25 mg each of terbutaline aerosol using either of two spacer devices--a tube spacer and conical spacer with inhalation valve (Nebuhaler)--in a randomised manner were compared in 20 patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. All participants (11 male, 9 female) aged 16 to 50 years had clinically Stable_HP baseline airway obstruction responsive to bronchodilators. The maximum per cent increase of PEFR and FEV1 were significantly higher after inhalation via Nebuhaler than tube spacer (44.93 +/- 21.15% vs 26.67 +/- 13.17%; 74.0 +/- 17.87 vs 47.65 +/- 15.74% respectively, p less than 0.01). The increase noted at each time interval was significantly higher and more sustained with Nebuhaler. In terms of bronchodilator effect Nebuhaler had definite advantage over tube spacer in our study. There were no significant changes in pulse rate nor in blood pressure.

[Status of the regulatory systems and substantiation of the indicators for conservative and surgical treatments of patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].Immunological reactivity, sympathetic-adrenal+ and pituitary-adrenal systems were studied in 758 patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The results served the basis for construction of 4 adaptogram types which reflect the status of adaptation. Therapeutic and surgical indications are suggested for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP sufferers allowing for the relationship between standard conservative treatment, modification of immunity, various surgical interventions and adaptation status.

[Role of eosinophils in the pathogenesis of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].Analysis is made of the results of a comprehensive examination of 313 Asthma_ASDPTO_HP patients. The examination included the revealing of the information relations of the absolute count of blood eosinophils, their changes after administration of a standard dose of adrenaline, the eosinophil count in sputum and bronchial secretion. Significant information relations with the build-up parameters, alterations in bronchial patency, a number of immunological and biochemical characteristics were discovered. Analysis of the measure of the information relation evidences the pathogenetic and prognostic role of eosinophils in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Long-term multicentric study with azelastine in patients with intrinsic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Efficacy and tolerance of azelastine (A 5610; CAS 58581-89-8), a new antiallergic compound with a unique structure, were investigated over up to one year of treatment in 225 male and female out-patients (age mean +/- s = 48 +/- 13 years) suffering from chronified intrinsic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The trial was conducted by 24 German and Austrian consulting physicians of pneumology. Plasma levels indicated sufficient compliance in almost 90% of the patients. Tablets containing 4.4 mg azelastine HCl were administered b.i.d. in addition to the pre-existing antiasthmatic medication. Only other antiallergic agents were Excluded_HP. Adverse events, vital parameters and laboratory tests on safety were tightly assessed. Eighteen patients dropped out because of adverse events, 78 reported adverse experiences under therapy, normally Mild_HP and "vegetative" symptoms. No indicative findings regarding blood pressure, heart rate and laboratory tests were seen. The most Frequent_HP observations were taste disorders, Asthenia_HP and Increased_body_weight_HP. No serious side effects at all were reported. The results on efficacy obtained from this non-controlled study may be predicative due to a baseline validation by an initial single blind placebo controlled run-in phase. Statistically significant improvements were seen for FEV1 and for the physicians' and the patients' rating on efficacy. To a lesser extent peak flow and airway resistance were improved, too. Thus, azelastine was safely tolerated over one year and might be effective in intrinsic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

In vivo anti-inflammatory activity of 7-(1,3-dithiolan-2-ylmethyl)-1,3-dimethylxanthine.A new methylxanthine derivative [7-(1,3-dithiolan-2-ylmethyl)-1,3-dimethylxanthine, ABC 99] with mucoregulatory and antibronchospastic properties has been studied. ABC 99 was observed to have marked anti-inflammatory activity in a series of experimental trials involving the principal mediators of inflammation (PAF, histamine, serotonin, LTC4-like substances, etc). It inhibits the formation of oedemas induced both by carrageenin and PAF in the rat paw, and reduces the increase in vascular permeability induced by histamine and serotonin. ABC 99 was also found to inhibit PAF-induced Pleuritis_HP, reducing the volume of pleural exudate and the presence of LTC4-like substances in the pleural cavity. When administered subacutely, ABC 99 checks the formation of granulation tissue caused by the subcutaneous implantation of cotton pellets in the rat. These experimental results indicate ABC 99 may be of particular interest in the treatment of respiratory disorders involving obstructive inflammation and bronchial hypersensitivity.

Reactivity of lymphoid cells isolated from the tracheobroncheal lymph nodes of two guinea-pig strains with high or low susceptibility to respiratory Anaphylactic_shock_HP.The mechanisms underlying the different sensitivity to respiratory Anaphylactic_shock_HP were studied in two inbred strains of guinea pigs with high (IMM/S) or low (IMM/R) sensitivity to ovalbumin (OA) aerosol-induced respiratory Anaphylactic_shock_HP. Guinea pigs were immunized with OA in Freund's complete adjuvant and lymphocyte stimulation tests were done with cells from the tracheobroncheal lymph nodes (TBL) draining the airways, from Peripheral_HP blood lymphocytes and from the axillary and inguinal lymph nodes. The TBL of the IMM/R strain had a significantly lower response than those of the IMM/S strain. This selectively low response, which was not antigen specific, could be increased by cyclophosphamide pretreatment. The high TBL response in the IMM/S strain was decreased by OA inhalations to the level of the IMM/R strain. OA inhalations decreased the IgE response in the IMM/S but not the IMM/R strain. Different interpretations of these findings are discussed, with emphasis on the possibility that an inherent suppressor cell population in the TBL are involved.

Density distribution and density conversion of neutrophils in allergic subjects.We investigated the density distribution of neutrophils in Peripheral_HP blood of allergic subjects. We divided neutrophils into four groups: fraction 1 (density greater than 1.085), fraction 2 (1.081 less than density less than or equal to 1.085), fraction 3 (1.077 less than density less than or equal to 1.081) and fraction 4 (density less than or equal to 1.077). The percentage of neutrophils in fraction 2 in Allergic_Rhinitis_HP (AR) subjects or asthmatics was lower than that in normals (p less than 0.01). The percentage of neutrophils in fraction 3 and fraction 4 from AR or asthmatics was greater than that in normals (fraction 3, p less than 0.01; fraction 4, p less than 0.05). In neutrophils from AR subjects (fraction 3), chemotaxis to N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine or platelet-activating factor (PAF) was enhanced compared to fraction 2. PAF (10(-7) M) changed the density of neutrophils (p less than 0.01), which were inhibited by WEB 2086 (p less than 0.05). Furthermore, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor changed the density of neutrophils (p less than 0.01). These findings suggest that biological agents may activate neutrophils and convert their density resulting in neutrophils with lower density in allergic subjects.

Denial of separation Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP as measured by a serial tachistoscopic technique.A mother-child separation stimulus was repeatedly presented by standard Defense Mechanism Test procedure, at increasing durations of tachistoscopic exposure to 60 clinical and nonclinical subjects. Subjective verbal reports were coded blindly for evidence of perceptual distortions presumably indicative of denial of separation Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP. Low scores on two items measuring sensitivity to separation Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP and intolerance of aloneness were, as predicted, significantly more often characterized by codings of denial on the tachistoscopic Exposures_ASDPTO than subjects with high sensitivity to separation Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP. Stability of effect became stronger when only very low and very high scores were compared for perceptual denial on the last four presentations of the series. This technique, employing other types of Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP-evoking stimuli, may represent a reliable instrument to reveal the presence of defences toward each of the most relevant conflictual areas of the personality.

Antigenicity of Penicillium notatum in animals and in atopic patients.A mycelial and metabolic extract of Penicillium notatum (PN) was passed through Sephadex G-50 and DEAE-cellulose columns in order to separate soluble fractions that revealed a complex composition. Their proteins and hexoses were recorded with a LKB Uvicord spectrophotometer and quantified by the Lowry and the indol techniques. On the other hand an animal model was developed in rabbits and an IgG precipitin and hemagglutinating antibodies were obtained. The PN extract as well as those fractions with the higher protein content appeared positive when they were checked against the antiserum by means of Ouchterlony, Boyden and immunoelectrophoresis. The molecular weight of PN was established in 52,000 daltons approximately in comparison with well known marker proteins. Adult human beings suffering perennial Rhinitis_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP showed positive type I skin tests with PN and its most conspicuous fractions (glycoproteins). A RAST-IgE-anti-PN was prepared following Ceska's procedure and challenged against all human sera. Only 40% of the patients revealed a positive RAST IgE-anti-PN which correlated significatively with the protein fractions (35%) and with the skin tests (43% and 39%, respectively). These results reinforced the idea that PN is a potent antigenic mold both in animals and in humans in whom we detected an IgE specific antibody presumably related to their atopic clinical condition.

Prevention of allergic diseases and IgE dosification in cord sera.In 1986, a Program on Prevention of Allergic Diseases was initiated in our country which was possible on account of the organization conditions of our health system. The program includes IgE measurement in umbilical cord serum by means of an ultramicroanalytic technique for IgE quantification. This is an Heterogeneous_HP sandwich-type immunoassay that requires only 10 microliters of reactive on each reaction step and its processing is carried out on the Cuban SUMA equipment. Two groups of children were selected and followed-up: group I included 80 one-year-old infants and group II included 60 18-months-old infants. Both groups followed hypoallergenic diets and had minimal exposure to aeroallergens within their microenvironment. Results were compared with those of respective control groups. Compliance of both groups with the prophylactic measures brought about a reduction in the existence of allergic diseases and a comparison with the control groups offered a statistically significant difference (p less than 0.001). Similarly, incidence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was found more reduced in groups I and II than in the control groups (p less than 0.001). Within the groups treated under the Program on Prevention of Allergic Diseases, IgE values were lower, while the control groups exhibited a higher number of infants with figures of 200 IU/ml or more (p less than 0.05). Our results support the usefulness of preventive measures in avoiding the presence of atopic diseases.

[The characteristics of postloading Bronchospasm_HP in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP patients].A study of 73 patients suffering of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP bronchiale with postloading Bronchospasm_HP and 20 without Bronchospasm_HP indicates that most pronounced bronchoconstriction after physical loads appears on the 15-20 minute in atopic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP of physical exertion and by the 5-10 min. in infectious-allergic form of the disease. It is recommended to use MEF75, MEF50 and MEF25 as a diagnostic criterion of postloading Bronchospasm_HP.

[Changes in plasma thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].We measured the plasma levels of TXB2, a Stable_HP metabolite of TXA2, and 6-K-PGF1 alpha, a Stable_HP metabolite of PGI2, in 28 Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics (16 of extrinsic type, 12 of intrinsic type) during symptomatic period and asymptomatic period respectively with radioimmunoassay. At the same time, plasma TXB2 and 6-K-PGF1 alpha were measured in 30 normal subjects for control. The results were as follows: (1) In the extrinsic Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics: The plasma TXB2 level measured during symptomatic period was significantly higher than that during asymptomatic period (P less than 0.05), while the plasma level of 6-K-PGF1 alpha measured during symptomatic period was significantly lower than that of normal subjects (P less than 0.01). The ratio of TXB2/6-K-PGF1 alpha measured during symptomatic period was significantly higher than that measured during asymptomatic period and that measured in the normal subjects (P less than 0.05). (2) In intrinsic Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics: The plasma 6-K-PGF1 alpha level measured during symptomatic period was significantly lower than that of normal subjects. There was no significantly difference between either plasma TXB2 level or ratio of TXB2/6-K-PGF1 alpha measured during symptomatic period and that measured during asymptomatic period as well as that of normal subjects. From these results it is suggested that (1) The TXA2 and PGI2 may play a different role in different types of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, (2) The Postural_instability_HP between TXA2-PGI2 may be one of the important factors that take part in the pathogenesis of extrinsic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Long-term effects of budesonide on airway responsiveness and clinical Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Severity_HP in inhaled steroid-dependent asthmatics.Budesonide 400 micrograms daily, in nonsteroid-dependent Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, can produce improvements in airway responsiveness and clinical Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Severity_HP, with some patients returning to normal responsiveness and becoming asymptomatic. This study examined whether similar improvements occur when asthmatics, who are dependent upon inhaled steroids, take either a regular maintenance dose of inhaled steroid or twice that amount for a year. Thirty two asthmatics were each stabilized on the minimum amount of inhaled steroid that would keep symptoms non-troublesome. In a double-blind, randomized manner, half were assigned to remain on a maintenance dose (MD) and the rest received twice that dose (MDx2) for one year. Before and monthly throughout the study, airway responsiveness to methacholine was measured and clinical Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Severity_HP assessed by questionnaire, inhaled bronchodilator use and number of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP exacerbations. There was a significant improvement in airway responsiveness and clinical Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Severity_HP in both treatment groups. Those on MDx2 showed the greatest improvement but the difference between the two groups did not reach significance. This study provides strong evidence that Prolonged_HP use of inhaled steroids is associated with improvement in airway responsiveness and clinical Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Severity_HP in inhaled steroid-dependent Asthma_ASDPTO_HP with a suggestion that the improvements are dose related.

Are we recording peak flows properly in young children?Peak flow rate is used in young children to assess bronchodilator response and monitor Asthma_ASDPTO_HP status at home. Frequently the best of only three peak flow manoeuvres is reported. The aim of this study was to assess if this was sufficient to give the maximum peak flow rate and to determine the reproducibility of the measurement. Thirty nine children aged between three and ten years were recruited. Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) was measured six times in each child at two minute intervals. Less than half (13 of 39) of the children made their maximum blow in the first three manoeuvres. The maximum peak flow from the second set of three blows was a median of 7% greater than that from the first three blows. The coefficient of variation of the measurement was 8.8% suggesting a change in PEFR greater than 17.6% is necessary to demonstrate a response to bronchodilator. We conclude three peak flow manoeuvres are insufficient in the majority of young children to demonstrate the maximum peak flow.

[The assessment of cell-mediated immunity in Allergy_HP patients].The cell-mediated immunity was assessed in patients with atopic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, non-atopic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Allergic_Rhinitis_HP by intracutaneous tests with bacterial allergens. "Set for cell immunity determination" and phytohemagglutinin. The cell-mediated immunity was statistically significantly more often disturbed in the allergic patients than in the Healthy_HP controls. The differences between the separate nosologic entities were insignificant. Best correlations were found between the tests with phytohemagglutinin and the standard set and between phytohemagglutinin and tuberculin from the standard set.

Best correlations were found between the tests with phytohemagglutinin and the standard set and between phytohemagglutinin and tuberculin from the standard set.
[Current humoral profile in Status_asthmaticus_HP].This study examined the relationships between acid-base disorders, Hypoxemia_HP, electrolyte imbalances, plasma adrenaline (Ad) and noradrenaline (NAd) in 94 patients with Status_asthmaticus_HP. Criteria of inclusion were [PaO2 + PaCO2/.8] less than 140 mmHg when breathing air (FiO2 = 21%) and/or PaCO2 greater than or equal to 45 mmHg. PaCO2 was closely related to H+ in those patients with Hypercapnia_HP: H+ nmol/l = 0.88 PaCO2 + 4 (r 0.91 ; n = 61; p less than 0.001). However, among the 62 acidotic cases (pH less than or equal to 7.36), 24 were classified as respiratory, 22 as mixed and 16 as metabolic. A loose though highly significant relationship was found between PaO2 and PaCO2 (when breathing air). Blood lactate, which was 3.61 +/- 1.9 mmol/l (+/- SD), was not correlated with anion gap or H+, but was loosely related to PaO2 and kalemia. Ad (1.53 +/- 1.17 nmol/l) and NAd (5.85 +/- 3.44 nmol/l), measured at the time of admission in 27 patients (FIO2 = 21%), varied significantly from those of a control group (p less than 0.01). NAd was correlated with H+, lactate and especially PaCO2, whereas no correlation could be established for Ad with these factors or NAd values. On the average, kalemia, phosphatemia and calcemia were lowered. In conclusion, mixed and Metabolic_Acidosis_HP were more common in this study than in a previous personal series and were not necessarily associated with an increase in blood lactate. Drugs taken prior to hospitalization must be considered in the pathophysiology of hyperlactatemia, which appears to be one among several factors linked to NAd levels.

Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and Candida albicans colonization of the respiratory tract in corticosteroid-dependent Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Fungal studies were conducted on 35 patients with corticosteroid-dependent Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (CSDA) and 20 asthmatics who had never received prednisolone. Candida albicans was repeatedly cultured from the sputa of 12 patients with CSDA. Isolation was more Frequent_HP in those patients who were receiving more than 10 mg prednisolone for more than six months. Nearly half of these patients demonstrated a positive immediate cutaneous reaction and precipitating antibodies against C. albicans. Although no pathological significance, beside colonization, could be attributed to this finding, it was felt that it would be prudent to restrict the daily dose of prednisolone to less than 10 mg, when administered for more than six moths. Two patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), were identified, one from each group. The possibility of ABPA, however, remained open in two other patients with CSDA. It is probable that some patients with CSDA may be suffering from ABPA but characteristic features of the disease are masked by costicosteroid therapy, making it difficult to diagnose.

A longitudinal study of risk factors in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Chronic_Bronchitis_HP in childhood.The prevalence, persistence, incidence and remission rates of reported diagnosed Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Chronic_Bronchitis_HP has been studied longitudinally over ten years in a representative community sample of children and adolescents. The objectives are to evaluate the rates of change over time, the role of Family_history_HP of disease, and the social risk factors in the longitudinal course of disease. The relationship between the two reported diagnoses is very high, about half of each group having the other Diagnosis_ASDPTO. Each Diagnosis_ASDPTO has specific symptoms with which it is associated. Remission of clinical disease is associated with continuing symptoms in about half of such cases.

[The role of inflammation in the etiopathogenesis of occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].Numerous recent studies point out a relationship between bronchial reactivity and the inflammation of the airways. The paper deals with the most Frequent_HP mechanisms of bronchoconstriction in occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP combined with inflammatory process. The importance of inflammation in the Moira Chan-Yeung classification of occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is emphasized. According to this classification several types of occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP are associated with the working environment. It is stressed that continuing prophylaxis of inflammation should protect the worker from irreversible airflow obstruction. This is of special interest to the population suffering from occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Successes and failures in the treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.In the past decade a spectacular development could be observed in the field of antiAsthma_ASDPTO_HPtic drugs. Though the new drugs did not produce radical change but they created a wide range of treatment possibilities. This paper is dealing with three, probably most rapidly developing fields of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP therapy. 1. Immunotherapy. The most important allergens could be isolated in a high purity with up-to-date chemical analitical methods. This affords possibility for a more reliable determination of individual sensitivity and desensitizing treatment. 2. Mediator release blocking drugs. While common antiAsthma_ASDPTO_HPtic medicaments try to counterbalance the effect of chemical mediators released by antigen-antibody reaction, the former partly block mediator release but also decrease bronchial hyperreactivity characteristic of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. 3. Glucocorticosteroids. Recent halogenized steroid preparations did not diminish the risk of Severe_HP side effects. Their application is limited in time, they are used mainly for the prevention and treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic crisis. Among aerosolized steroids, preparations considered as optimal have local effect but they are slightly absorbed from the mucous membrane. In spite of the new drugs, medication depending on individual sensitivity, actual complaints and lung function values is essential, the Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic needs continuous care based on symptoms, complaints.

[Treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in winter using controlled-release salbutamol].This paper presents results about comparative study in winter season, in a statistics design AB and BA on 20 patients that were treated with salbutamol (Group B) and with salbutamol of controlled liberation (Group B) at random. Results showed that patients of Group B had improvement in symptomatology and had less exacerbations than those patients of group A with statistical significance. It was concluded that salbutamol tablets of controlled liberation is a therapeutic method adequate to control Chronic_HP phase of Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients in winter season.

[The role of different microorganisms and infectious processes in the occurrence and course of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].The role of infection in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (BA) is unknown. The pathogenesis of BA contributes to the origin of infectious processes induced by different microorganisms. In view of the predominance of associations of viruses and bacteria in the etiology and pathogenesis of Acute_HP Respiratory_tract_infection_HP, it is difficult to define in vivo the share and role of these microorganisms which participate in the origin and enhancement of hypersensitivity, hyperreactivity and alterations in beta-adrenoreactivity. Some factors of bacterial pathogenicity promote BA progress. On contact with basophils and mast cells bacteria (both pathogenic ones and ordinary commensals) are capable of liberating histamine and other mediators during colonization of the bronchial tree and origin other infectious process. This mechanism of mediator liberation may contribute to the transformation of pre-Asthma_ASDPTO_HP to BA or provoke its exacerbation.

[The complex assessment of disordered bronchial patency in Chronic_HP obstructive lung diseases].There were 63 patients with infectious-allergic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and 13 patients with Chronic_HP obstructive Bronchitis_HP. The clinical and bronchoscopic manifestations of the broncho-obstructive syndrome were compared to external respiratory function (ERF) reflecting the status of bronchial patency at different levels of the bronchial tree and the measurement data on the rheological properties of bronchial secretion. A reverse interrelationship was discovered between the Severity_HP of asphyxia attacks and patency of the Distal_HP bronchial according to the ERF estimates. A correlation was noted between the magnitude of bronchial secretion viscosity and some characteristics: Severity_HP of asphyxia attacks, Dyspnea_HP, number of dry Crackles_HP; bronchial patency according to the ERF estimates. The values of secretion viscosity turned out to be most closely interrelated with the patency of small bronchi. A correlation was discovered between the bronchoscopic findings and bronchial patency of the Proximal_HP bronchi (ERF estimates). It is believed that bronchoscopic examination plays an important part in the Diagnosis_ASDPTO of obstruction of the bronchi accessible to inspection and has a high information content. Hyperdiscrinism Severity_HP determines in many respects the clinical manifestations of the broncho-obstructive syndrome, measurement data on viscosity and adhesion of bronchial secretion can be used for assessing the efficacy of the action on bronchial obstruction at the level of small bronchi.

[Kaposi's_Sarcoma_HP complicating long-term corticotherapy for Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].Kaposi's_Sarcoma_HP frequently develops in patients with Immunodeficiency_HP which may be drug-induced (corticosteroids, immunodepressants). We report a case of Kaposi's_Sarcoma_HP in a 75-year old man who had been taking oral prednisone continually for 7 years as treatment of Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Data from the literature clearly show that corticosteroid therapy may trigger the development of Kaposi's_Sarcoma_HP in patients who usually possess several other pathogenetic factors of that disease, such as pre-existing Immunodeficiency_HP, environmental (viruses) or genetic factors. In some cases, withdrawing corticosteroids may result in complete remission of the cutaneous lesions.

[Release of leukotrienes (LTC4, D4, E4, B4) from Peripheral_HP leukocytes in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].To evaluate the pathogenetic role of leukotrienes in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, the levels of leukotrienes released from leukocytes stimulated by calcium ionophore A23187 were measured by the HPLC-RIA method in 32 Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients (12 infectious type, 12 non-hyposensitized atopic type, and 8 hyposensitized atopic type). The following results were obtained: 1) The level of leukotrienes released from the leukocytes of Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients were higher than those of Healthy_HP subjects, but there was no significant difference in the levels of leukotrienes between Mild_HP and Moderate_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients. 2) The levels of leukotriene B4 released from the leukocytes of the infectious-type Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients were higher than those of the atopic Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients (non-hyposensitized group). There was a tendency for levels of leukotriene C4 released from the leukocytes of the infectious-type Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients to be higher than those of the atopic-type Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients. 3) The levels of peptide leukotriene released from the leukocytes of the atopic hyposensitized patients were lower than those of the patients in the atopic non-hyposensitized group, but there were no significant differences in leukotriene B4 between the groups. In addition, the levels of leukotriene C4 released spontaneously from the leukocytes of the hyposensitized group of patients were lower than those in the non-hyposensitized group. 4) Though the mechanism of the efficacy of hyposensitization has not been completely clarified, the reduction of leukocyte ability to release peptide leukotrienes through immunotherapy seems to be part of this mechanism. These results suggest that leukotrienes may play some role in the pathogenesis of both atopic- and infectious-type Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

[Cough_HP provocation test in Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic children].The effects of pH and osmolarity on Cough_HP receptors were evaluated by inhalation of aqueous aerosol in 37 children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Each of 3 different pH solutions (low 1.85-3.25, neutral 6.9-7.1, high 8.0-8.4) was combined with 3 different osmolarities (hypo 0-31, iso 254-292, hyper 830-1117 mOsm/kg), and 9 solutions were prepared. To evaluate the effect of low chloride ion concentration, neutral pH and iso-osmolar solution including low chloride ion was also prepared. These aqueous aerosols were administered from a Devilbiss 646 nebulizer for 10 seconds. Cough_HP was induced in 28 subjects (76%) by inhalation of low pH and hyperosmolar solution, in one subject (3%) by low pH and iso-osmolar, in one (3%) by low pH and hypo-osmolar, in three (8%) by neutral pH and hypo-osmolar, and in none by any of the other solutions. It was suggested that the alteration of pH or osmolarity alone could not induce Cough_HP effectively, and that the combination of pH and osmolarity was the important factor for the induction of Cough_HP.

[Creola bodies and the eosinophil cationic protein in sputum in Acute_HP asthmatic attacks with respect to their clinical significance].Creola bodies (CrB) are characteristically present in sputa from patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. We studied the relationship among the numbers of CrB, the course of asthmatic attacks and the concentration of sputum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP). Twenty-two asthmatic attacks in 17 patients were studied. Sputum collections pulmonary function tests were made before or during treatment in patients who came to the outpatient clinic or emergency room. Smears of 100 microliters of sputum were made on glass slides and CrB were studied over the whole area of glass slide stained with Papanicolaou's stain. CrB scores were determined from the number and the size of CrB on each slide. In hospitalized patients the CrB scores, the concentrations of sputum ECP and the Severity_HP scores of asthmatic attacks were highest on the day of admission, decreasing in association with each other and returning to the baseline level in approximately 5 days. There were significant correlations among the CrB score, the concentration of sputum ECP and %FEV1.0 (p less than 0.001). The CrB score on the day of clinical appraisal significantly correlated with the number 6f days of treatment needed for remission. These results are in keeping with the hypothesis that eosinophils cause Scaling_skin_HP of respiratory epithelial cells resulting in prolongation of asthmatic attacks. Observation of CrB seemed to be useful as a marker of duration of asthmatic attacks.

[The participation of epithelial Scaling_skin_HP in the increase of bronchial hyperresponsiveness after antigen challenge in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) was evaluated before and after antigen challenge in 12 patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP as allergic reaction to house dust mites. Six out of the 12 showed an increase in BHR 48 hours after antigen challenge. Although there was no difference in the decrease of FEV1.0 in IAR and LAR between patients with (group A) and without (group B) the increase of BHR after antigen challenge, patients in group A expectorated a significantly larger number of clumps of respiratory epithelial cells (Creola bodies, CrB) in their sputum in both IAR and LAR. In addition, the degree of the increase of BHR significantly correlated with the CrB score, which was determined from the number and the size of CrB. These results suggest that epithelial Scaling_skin_HP participates in the increase of BHR after antigen challenge. The concentration of the eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) in their sputum did not change significantly in IAR and LAR compared with that before antigen challenge. There was no difference in the concentration of ECP in their sputum between the two groups either. One antigen challenge seemed to be too Mild_HP to induce an elevation of the concentration of ECP in their sputum. Judging from the fact that CrB could be observed not only at LAR but also IAR, epithelial Scaling_skin_HP seemed to be dependent on the degree of damage before antigen challenge rather than on the activation of eosinophils after antigen challenge.

The concentration of the eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) in their sputum did not change significantly in IAR and LAR compared with that before antigen challenge. There was no difference in the concentration of ECP in their sputum between the two groups either. One antigen challenge seemed to be too mild to induce an elevation of the concentration of ECP in their sputum. Judging from the fact that CrB could be observed not only at LAR but also IAR, epithelial desquamation seemed to be dependent on the degree of damage before antigen challenge rather than on the activation of eosinophils after antigen challenge.
Measurement of response to methacholine inhalation challenge in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Allergic_Rhinitis_HP. PC20 or PC35FEV1?It has been widely accepted that significant bronchial responsiveness is demonstrated by a 20% fall in the FEV1 during the course of a methacholine challenge (PC20 or PD20FEV1). However, many subjects with Allergic_Rhinitis_HP may have a positive reaction, as evidenced by attaining a PC20 or PD20FEV1, and then demonstrate a plateau. When the PC35FEV1 is used, individuals with this plateau versus individuals with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP can clearly be differentiated. We thus decided to assess bronchial responsiveness to methacholine with PC20 and PC35FEV1 in asthmatics and patients with Allergic_Rhinitis_HP. Bronchial challenge with methacholine by the method described by Cockcroft et al., with a Hudson 1720 nebulizer (output: 0.198 +/- 0.017 ml/min) was performed on 57 asthmatics and on 56 patients with Allergic_Rhinitis_HP. At the time of the study, they had an FEV1 and FVC greater than or equal to 80% of their predicted normal value and a FEV1FVC% greater than or equal to 70%. Results were expressed as the provocative concentration of methacholine required to produce a 20% and 35% fall in FEV1 (PC20 and PC35FEV1). A plateau was considered if 3 or more consecutive doses of methacholine produced no fall in FEV1 greater than 5%. By the PC20FEV1, bronchial responsiveness was increased (PC20 less than or equal to 18 mg/ml) in 98% of patients with bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and in 28% of patients with Allergic_Rhinitis_HP. By the PC35FEV1, bronchial hyperexcitability (PC35FEV1 less than or equal to 40 mg/ml) was detected in 93% of patients with bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and in 12% of patients with Allergic_Rhinitis_HP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Efficacy of sublingual immunotherapy in patients with Rhinitis_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP due to house dust mite. A double-blind study.Fifty eight patients under 12 years of age, positive to mites (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and D. farinae) according to prick, "in vitro" specific IgE and challenge tests, suffering from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Rhinitis_HP, were randomly assigned on a double blind basis to receive per os either a biologically standardized extract of mites (active therapy TA = 30 patients) or a saline buffered solution (placebo = 28 patients). Patients took sublingually increasing doses of the solution, followed by maintenance therapy consisting of 15 drops 3 times a week. The results of the trial were assessed after 12 an 18 months, according to the following parameters: symptom scores recorded in diary cards, total and specific IgE levels, total IgG level, IgG1 and IgG4 levels, lymphocytes underpopulations, nasal challenge test, side effects. During the first 18 months, the patients on active therapy had significantly lower scores (p less than 0.001) and clear variations of rhinomanometric parameters (p less than 0.01); IgG also significantly increased. After 12 months, bronchial specific and specific challenge tests showed significantly higher threshold values in comparison to initial values (p less than 0.05). No statistically significative variation was registered in the placebo group.

Childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and outdoor air pollution in Oporto area.The influence of outdoor air pollution, on childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, is not yet completely understood, especially a long exposition to low but persistent pollutants levels. This paper presents the relationship between air pollution, as sulphur dioxide (SO2) and black smoke (BS), and asthmatic attacks on children living in the Oporto area, during the period between 1983 and 1987, when its levels ranged below the official "security" ones. There was no correlation between daily levels of SO2 or BS, and the asthmatic attacks rate. However, for longer periods, as months and quarters, an increased positive correlation was found, but only with SO2 (r = 0.334, p = 0.01; r = 0.473, p = 0.07, for month and quarter periods, respectively). These data suggest that, neither SO2 nor BS seem to be direct Bronchospasm_HP inductors, at least when its levels stay between the relatively low limits observed. On the other hand, the longer exposition to SO2 appears to lower the threshold of the asthmatic children to other Bronchospasm_HP stimulus.

Diagnosis_ASDPTO and treatment of TMJ, head, neck and asthmatic symptoms in children.The normal physiologic tension of the TMJ muscles, fascia, ligaments, and associated structures is critical for the health of children. Pathologic strain patterns in the soft tissues can be a primary cause of Headache_HP, neckaches, throat infections, ear infections, sinus congestion, and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. This article presents effective diagnostic and treatment modalities from both dental and physical therapy viewpoints to relieve and restore normal physiology to the TMJ muscles, fascia, ligaments, and associated structures. As structural balance is restored, a nutritional component of therapy is strongly recommended for the child's optimum health.

[Current aspects of the therapy of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in childhood].The management goals common to all age groups are to reduce symptoms, to permit a normal physically active lifestyle, and to prevent irreversible airway obstruction. Main measures are environmental manipulation (avoidance of allergen contact, cigarette smoke and pets; psychotherapeutic management), assessment of Severity_HP, training for self management, hyposensitization (pollen, HDM, insect venoms) and pharmacotherapy. Medication should be adapted to age and Severity_HP of the disease, and the different drugs should be used stepwise. The first step includes the application of bronchodilators in which beta-2-stimulants are to be preferred. If we use spacers or jet nebulizers infants can also be treated successfully. The value of xanthines is discussed controversially. The next steps tend to reduce the inflammatory reaction. In this direction sodium cromoglycate and ketotifen are useful especially in childhood, and inhaled steroids have increasing importance. The use of oral corticosteroids should be the last step.

[Individually-adjusted dosages of aminophylline in children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].Theophylline concentrations in serum between 10 to 20 micrograms/ml cannot be obtained with usual dosage of theophylline in children with individual very short elimination half time of theophylline. Multiple corrections of dosage and repeated controls of theophylline concentrations in serum are necessary for empirical adjustment of individual optimal dosage. Pharmacokinetic investigations were made to shorten this management. 12 patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, 6 to 18 years of age, received 1.5 to 3 tablets of Aminophyllin under conditions of steady state. Blood samples were taken up to 6 hours after oral application. As a result of statistical analysis we found that the biological half time of theophylline could be determined from 2 to 3 blood samples. Estimation of optimal individual dosage is possible by simple mathematical pharmacokinetic formulas.

Effects of ozone exposure on experimental Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in guinea pigs sensitized with ovalbumin through the airway.As ozone (O3) is known to cause airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness, we examined the effects of O3 exposure (1, 3, or 5 ppm, 2 h) on sensitization and provocation in guinea pigs sensitized with ovalbumin (OA) through the airway. In groups exposed to O3 before sensitization, 5 ppm increased the production of IgG1 antibodies and decreased the OA sensitization threshold from 0.01 to 0.002%. In those exposed before provocation, 1, 3, or 5 ppm of O3 decreased the OA provocation threshold from 0.5 to 0.02%, and this enhancement appeared to depend on airway hyperresponsiveness. We conclude that O3 exposure may play an important role in causing asthmatic attacks rather than enhancing allergic sensitization.

PAF-dependent phosphatidylinositol turnover in platelets: differences between asthmatics and normal individuals.The effects of nebulized platelet-activating factor (PAF) on the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems, and on the platelets present in Peripheral_HP blood were investigated in 9 normal individuals and in 6 patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and 3 individuals with lyso-PAF. The inhalation of PAF caused an Acute_HP decrease in specific airway conductance. The circulatory system parameters monitored showed an increase in heart rate while blood pressure decreased in both groups that were studied. The inhalation of PAF led to a significant increase in the differential count of polymorphonuclear leukocytes after 15 min; the count returned to the initial level after 24 h. However, the platelet count remained unchanged. The phosphatidylinositol (PI) turnover and in particular the formation of 1,4,5-inositoltrisphosphate (IP3) in platelets were investigated after PAF inhalation. It also mediated an increase in intracellular free calcium concentration, [Ca2+]i, in response to a second challenge with exogenous PAF. The basal levels of IP3 and [Ca2+]i were significantly greater in the platelets of patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP than in those of normal individuals (p less than 0.01). Platelets that had been isolated from normal and asthmatic subjects had a higher concentration of IP3 and [Ca2+]i in the platelets after an in vitro exposure to PAF. After an inhalation challenge with PAF, the platelets of both the normal individuals and the patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP showed a specific refractoriness to the in vitro exposure to PAF. Perhaps, this is an explanation for the PAF-dependent tachyphylaxis that is commonly observed in both normal and asthmatic individuals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Allergic sensitization in elderly patients with Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP.To study whether allergic sensitization occurs in elderly patients with Chronic_HP pulmonary obstructive disease (Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP), we examined serum IgE and skin test reactivity to allergens in three age-matched groups of normal subjects, and in patients with Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (BA). Serum IgE was significantly higher in patients with Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP and BA than in normal subjects (p less than 0.05), and patients with Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP showed serum IgE levels as high as those of patients with BA. However, the skin test scores were significantly higher in patients with BA than in normal subjects and patients with Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP (p less than 0.05). Neither serum IgE nor skin test score significantly correlated with FEV1%, PaO2, PaCO2 or Brinkman's Index in any group (p greater than 0.20). These results suggest that allergic sensitization occurs in elderly patients with Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP and that symptoms associated with Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP may be partly due to allergic inflammation.
Allergic sensitization in elderly patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.To study whether allergic sensitization occurs in elderly patients with chronic pulmonary obstructive disease (COPD), we examined serum IgE and skin test reactivity to allergens in three age-matched groups of normal subjects, and in patients with COPD and bronchial asthma (BA). Serum IgE was significantly higher in patients with COPD and BA than in normal subjects (p less than 0.05), and patients with COPD showed serum IgE levels as high as those of patients with BA. However, the skin test scores were significantly higher in patients with BA than in normal subjects and patients with COPD (p less than 0.05). Neither serum IgE nor skin test score significantly correlated with FEV1%, PaO2, PaCO2 or Brinkman's Index in any group (p greater than 0.20).

Socialization and psychosomatic disease: an empirical study of the educational style of parents with psychosomatic children.Starting from the assumption that psychosomatic diseases are distinct from neuroses and different kinds of socialization tend to predispose to the two disorders, the educational style of parents with psychosomatic children (n = 79, 30 Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, 19 Ulcerative_Colitis_ASDPTO_HP, 30 Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP) and with neurotic children (n = 51) was studied. Children and parents were given questionnaires on parental educational attitudes, techniques and goals. Significant differences were found on various dimensions, which indicate for example closer mother-child ties as well as father-child ties in the psychosomatic families. The results from this study are consistent with the concept of a restrictive socialization in psychosomatic families.

Continuous methacholine inhalation provocation with resistance monitoring in Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients.Continuous methacholine inhalation with simultaneous bronchial resistance monitoring was performed in 15 controls and 26 Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients. The subjects were in quiet tidal breathing, and the airway resistance measured by forced oscillation method were continuously recorded with X-Y recorder. The mean airway resistance of the Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients was higher than that of the control group, so was the conductance of the Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics lower than that of the control. All the Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics were responsive to the methacholine test, while only two controls had the response. No correlation could be obtained between bronchial reactivity and sensitivity, but the bronchial sensitivity was correlated with serum total IgE (r = 0.448; p less than 0.05), and suggest that the higher the IgE is, the more sensitive the Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients respond to methacholine. Continuous methacholine provocation is useful in the Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and is more safe and time-saving compared with conventional Recurrent_HP method.

[Effect of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP on growth and physical development].Radiologic bone measurements for determination of the skeletal maturation were conducted in 243 children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The authors describe marked retardation of skeletal maturation as a general phenomenon of the atopic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The grade of retardation is greater in atopics than in non-atopic Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics. The grade of quantitative response to allergic tests is significantly correlated with the extent of retardation of the skeletal maturation. It is discussed that in addition to Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, Eczema_HP and Allergic_Rhinitis_HP the retardation of the skeletal bone maturation could be a further original manifestation of atopia.

Immunoglobulin G subclass deficiency in children with high levels of immunoglobulin E and infection proneness.Of 32 unrelated children with serum IgE greater than 1,000 U/ml, 17 were found to have infection proneness according to standard clinical criteria, and 15 were not infection prone. There were no statistical differences between these 2 groups of children with regard to age, sex, serum IgE levels or prevalence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. However, the prevalence of Eczema_HP was significantly lower in the infection-prone group (p = 0.035). Of greater interest was the finding that 7 children in the infection-prone group had IgG subclass and/or Decreased_circulating_IgA_level_HP compared with none in the non-infection-prone group (p = 0.006). These results suggest that IgG subclass studies may be warranted in children with markedly elevated levels of serum IgE and proneness to infection.

[Pollen Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].In a group of 38 patients with typical symptoms of pollen Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, 34 pollen allergens were used attempting to determine what kinds of pollen most frequently occurred as causative agents leading to senzibilization in patients from the area of Banija. In subsequent procedure, positivity of cutaneous tests was found to correlate with the blood level of specific IgE (RAST), whereby a high percentage of consistent results was observed. Although polysensibilization is an important problem in the etiological Diagnosis_ASDPTO of this disease, we are inclined to believe the case history data supported by the results of allergometric tests to be quite sufficient to establish a relation between individual pollens and disease symptoms. Thus, allergologic examinations should involve accurate detection of the largest number of causative agents possible to allow both successful prophylaxis and specific immunologic treatment.

[Effect of salbutamol administered directly by a nebulizer or by means of a spacer on bronchodilation].During three successive days in 14 patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP after application of Salbutamol directly from the metered-dose inhaler (MDI) or indirectly by spacer the changes of FEF and FEV1 were measured. For inhalation through spacer the double blind crossover trial with placebo was used. Out of 12 patients three of them responded with better flows (FEV1, FEF) after inhalation via MDI. In 7 of them there were no significant differences between ways of application while in two of them the flows by spacer were significantly better. Tachypnea_HP, low lung volumes as well as poor co-operation of the patient, especially elderly, should speak in favour of the use of spacer. However, in young, co-operative Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients the MDI is suitable. Further controlled studies of new applications of inhalation therapy should be studied.

An allergic reaction to intravenous methylprednisolone administration.A 60-year-old woman with Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP developed Generalized_HP Urticaria_HP and rapidly worsening Bronchospasm_HP immediately after IV administration of methylprednisolone sodium succinate. Subsequent skin testing was positive for this, but for no other corticosteroid. Later, both IV dexamethasone during a Recurrent_HP attack and oral prednisone for Panhypopituitarism_HP were well tolerated. This patient and a review of the literature reveal that corticosteroids are a Very_rare_HP but important cause of Anaphylactic_shock_HP-like reaction.

Permanent brain damage possibly caused by theophylline in two elderly patients with airway obstruction.Two aged patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP who suffered convulsions that resulted in permanent brain damage during treatment with the recommended therapeutic dose of theophylline are presented here. A dose or concentration of theophylline lower than the recommended one should be considered in the treatment of some aged patients with pulmonary obstructive disease.

Assessment and prediction of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and its Severity_HP in the pediatric community.Seventy four asthmatic children aged 7 to 11 years were examined along with controls matched by age and sex. Clinical and laboratory investigations preceded a 28-day follow-up where data about morning and evening peak expiratory flow rate (PEF), symptoms and treatment were recorded. The coefficient of variation of PEF was found to be an objective measurement of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Severity_HP that has statistically significant correlation with both symptoms (rs = .36) and treatment (rs = .60). Moreover, it separates Mild_HP and Severe_HP asthmatics, as confirmed by statistically significant differences (p = .008 or less) in symptoms, treatment, skin Allergy_HP and airways response to exercise. Skin Allergy_HP and airways responsiveness to exercise were found to be predictors of both disease and Severity_HP. By means of logistic regression analysis it was possible to establish the probabilities for both Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP when children presenting and not presenting these characteristics are compared. One single positive skin test represent a probability of 88% for the development of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and a probability of 70% for Severe_HP disease. A PEF reduction of 10% after an exercise test implies a probability of 73% for disease and a probability of 64% for Severe_HP disease. Increases in these variables imply geometrically increased risks and their presence together have a multiplicative effect in the final risk.

Duration of protective effect of terbutaline sulfate and cromolyn sodium alone and in combination on Exercise-induced_Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.For subjects with EIA participating in physical activities throughout the day, Prolonged_HP duration of protection is desirable. The purpose of this study was to determine whether in EIA a combination of the recommended aerosol doses of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor agonist, terbutaline sulfate (0.5 mg), and cromolyn sodium (disodium cromoglycate; 2 mg) provides longer protection against EIA than either drug alone. On four separate days, following the administration of either placebo, terbutaline alone, cromolyn sodium alone or terbutaline and cromolyn sodium together, 12 subjects (seven men and five women; aged 18 to 28 years) with EIA performed four identical eight minute treadmill runs, each separated by two-hour intervals. Drug treatments were given double-blind, with the order counterbalanced using a Latin-square design. Pulmonary function was recorded before the drug, immediately before and after exercise, and at 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 15, and 30 minutes after exercise. Inspired ventilation, heart rate, and environmental conditions were monitored during exercise. A two-way analysis of variance was performed to investigate the main effects of time and drug treatment. Results indicated that in comparison with placebo, EIA was significantly reduced by either cromolyn sodium or terbutaline administered up to two hours (p less than 0.01) and by the combination (cromolyn sodium and terbutaline) up to four hours after inhalation (p less than 0.05). No significant differences were found between the combination and terbutaline during the initial two hours (p less than 0.5). We conclude that a combination of beta 2-adrenergic receptor agonist and cromolyn sodium is the treatment of choice for Prolonged_HP effective protection from EIA.

Airway hyperresponsiveness in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Some Asthma_ASDPTO_HP triggers exert their major action through cellular inflammatory mechanisms, with resultant airway hyperreactivity to both allergenic and nonallergenic stimuli. Other triggers are simply bronchospastic, so that they do not increase vulnerability. Anti-inflammatory treatments are more important than purely bronchodilator therapy is for long-term control of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Bronchial response to methacholine in "Healthy_HP" children of asthmatic parents. Effect of treatment with cromolyn sodium.Cumulative dose response curves to inhaled methacholine were established in 24 "Healthy_HP" children of asthmatic parents and 7 Healthy_HP children of Healthy_HP parents. Atopic children of asthmatic parents demonstrated higher bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR) than nonatopic children. The BHR was about ten times less than in the atopic parents of asthmatic children, indicating marked increase in BHR with age in atopic members of asthmatic families. Six weeks of treatment with cromolyn sodium (disodium cromoglycate) decreased BHR significantly (p less than 0.05) in eight atopic children, while no change occurred in BHR in five nonatopic children.

Breathing pattern Affect_ASDPTOs respiratory heat loss but not bronchoconstrictor response in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.To determine whether changes in breathing pattern alone Affect_ASDPTO respiratory heat loss (RHL) and the constrictor response to cold dry gas hyperpnea in asthmatic subjects, we performed the following 2 part study: first we measured RHL in 8 asthmatic and 8 normal subjects during controlled eucapnic hyperpnea while they breathed at inspiratory to expiratory ratios (I/E) of 1:3, 3:1, and 2:2, and we recorded postchallenge forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) in the asthmatic group; we then performed the same measurements in 8 asthmatic and 8 normal subjects at fixed target minute ventilation (VE) for tidal volumes of 0.2 X Forced vital capacity (FVC), 0.4 X FVC, and 0.6 X FVC by varying the target respiratory rate appropriately. Our results show that (1) increasing I/E ratio or tidal volume-Frequency_HP ratio (VT/f) at fixed VE produced small but statistically significant increases (p less than 0.05) in overall heat loss per unit volume of respired gas (RHL/VE) in both asthmatic and nonasthmatic subjects of 1-4 cal/L; (2) changes in breathing pattern alone did not Affect_ASDPTO bronchoconstrictor response as assessed by lack of change in slopes and intercepts of % delta FEV1 vs. RHL dose-response curves; and (3) the increase in RHL per unit volume of respired gas resulting from increasing VT/f ratios during cold gas hyperpnea was significantly greater in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic subjects. We conclude that changes in breathing pattern may Affect_ASDPTO overall RHL measured at the mouth, although the maximum effect of such changes in both asthmatic and nonasthmatic subjects is small (10-15%); that such changes do not significantly alter airway constrictor response in asthmatic persons; and (3) that the effects of changing breathing pattern on RHL may be more pronounced in asthmatic than nonasthmatic subjects, which suggests that the asthmatic group may be less able to adapt to factors that alter the magnitude and site of RHL.

Effect of fenoterol hydrobromide and sodium cromoglycate individually and in combination on postexercise Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.A double-blind trial involving 20 asthmatic patients was carried out to test the effect of fenoterol and sodium cromoglycate alone and in combination on ventilatory function one hour after medication. The results show that fenoterol, whether alone or in combination with sodium cromoglycate, can increase the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) by up to 25% both after rest and after exercise. No patient suffered a decrease in FEV1 using fenoterol, and at least 80% of them recorded an increase in ventilatory ability. Sodium cromoglycate was of no benefit in eliminating early reaction to exercise-induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Continuous intravenous terbutaline infusions for adult patients with Status_asthmaticus_HP.Since absorption of nebulized and subcutaneous terbutaline may be delayed or decreased during episodes of Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, a preliminary trial of intravenous terbutaline was instituted in five adult patients with Status_asthmaticus_HP. The terbutaline was administered as a bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 0.1-0.4 micrograms/kg/min. Although three patients may have received some improvement, the impact of intravenous terbutaline could not be distinguished from other concomitant therapy. All patients experienced tolerable adverse reactions. Further research to evaluate higher doses administered early in the hospital course and to determine receptor sensitivity needs to be conducted.

Exercise-induced_Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and the generation of neutrophil chemotactic activity.Heat-Stable_HP neutrophil chemotactic activity (HS NCA) has been demonstrated in serum of subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP after exercise and after allergen inhalation challenge. Heat-labile neutrophil chemotactic activity (HL NCA) has been investigated only after allergen inhalation challenge. In this study, we have measured HS NCA and HL NCA after exercise of 22 adult patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, 13 of whom had Exercise-induced_Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (EIA). In the 13 patients, the effect of pharmacologic pretreatment on the generation of HS NCA and EIA was evaluated in a double-blind study with inhalation of either disodium cromoglycate, terbutaline, or budesonide 15 minutes before exercise. Additionally, the effect of 4 weeks of treatment with budesonide aerosol was evaluated in an open study. A significant increase (p less than 0.01) in HS NCA was found in the patients with EIA with peak activities 15 minutes after exercise. In patients without EIA, the activity of HS NCA was variable. No HL NCA was detectable after exercise. EIA was inhibited by disodium chromoglycate, terbutaline, and 4 weeks of treatment with budesonide. The generation of HS NCA was more or less inhibited by all three drugs with 4 weeks of treatment with budesonide as the most potent regimen. No late-phase asthmatic reactions to exercise were found. It is concluded that only HS NCA is generated after exercise of subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and that this production is controlled by antiasthmatic drugs. However, the generation of HS NCA occurs irrespective of EIA.

Comparison between bronchial response to inhaled hypoosmolar and isoosmolar solutions of sodium cromoglycate after exercise challenge.The effectiveness of a sodium cromoglycate isoosmolar solution (288 mOsmol/L) versus hypoosmolar commercial solution (40 mOsmol/L) was studied in 14 asthmatic children with Exercise-induced_Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The mean FEV1 after exercise in patients pretreated with a sodium cromoglycate hypotonic solution compared with FEV1 at rest was -2% +/- 10%. The mean FEV1 after exercise in patients pretreated with an isotonic solution compared with FEV1 at rest was 3% +/- 6%. This statistically significant difference (P less than .01) proves that the effectiveness of sodium cromoglycate can be Ameliorated_by_HP raising the osmolarity to isotonic levels.

A double-blind, randomized study of sodium cromoglycate versus placebo in patients with cystic fibrosis and bronchial hyperreactivity.To evaluate the effects of sodium cromoglycate (SCG) on patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and with bronchial hyperreactivity, a long-term, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study was performed. Fourteen patients with CF and without Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (aged 7 to 29 years) and with bronchial hyperreactivity entered the study. Each patient received 8 weeks of 1% SCG nebulizer solution three to four times daily and 8 weeks of placebo. Seven patients received the treatment in the order SCG/placebo and seven patients in the reverse order. Evaluation of SCG effect was performed every 4 to 8 weeks by (1) clinical assessment of symptoms, (2) clinician and patient/parent opinion, (3) pulmonary function tests, and (4) methacholine provocation tests. After two patients were withdrawn for lack of cooperation, the results were evaluated for treatment effect (SCG versus placebo), period effect (whether SCG was administered first or last), or combination of both. No significant difference was found for these parameters for the clinical assessment of symptoms, the patient/parent and clinician opinion, their subjective preferences, the metacholine challenges, or the pulmonary function tests. The study did not demonstrate any benefit from the use of SCG in patients with CF and with bronchial hyperreactivity and does not support the routine use of SCG in patients with CF.

[Effectiveness and tolerance of disodium cromoglycate capsules in pellet form].The efficacy of, and tolerance to lactose-free sodium cromoglycate capsules was investigated in a multicentre trial. Data of 154 patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP treated at 41 centres were evaluated over an observation period of 5 weeks. During treatment there was a significant reduction in the required dosage of concomitant medication, a marked improvement with regard to the Severity_HP of symptoms and a significant increase in peak flow rates. Assessment of treatment was "good" or "very good" in 86% of patients. Mild_HP side effects such as Cough_HP or throat irritation were seen in only 2.6% of patients.

Mechanisms of decrease in cytoplasmic motility of alveolar macrophages during immediate asthmatic response in dogs.To study the cytoplasmic motility (CM) of alveolar macrophages (AM) during immediate asthmatic response, we measured remanent filed strength (RFS) in dogs in vivo after Ascaris suum-antigen (AA) inhalation. Four days after instillation of ferrimagnetic particles (Fe3O4, 3 mg/kg) into the Right_HP lower lobe bronchus, RFS was measured at the body surface immediately after magnetization of the Fe3O4 particles by an externally applied magnetic field. RFS decreased with time because of particle rotation (relaxation). Relaxation is thought to be correlated to CM of AM (J. Appl. Physiol. 55: 1196-1202, 1983). AA inhalation increased respiratory resistance (Rrs) in 10 dogs (responders; P less than 0.01), and did not change Rrs in five dogs (nonresponders; P greater than 0.50). The relaxation rate (lambda 0) significantly decreased because of AA inhalation in responders (P less than 0.01), whereas lambda 0 did not change in nonresponders (P greater than 0.50). Intravenous injection of indomethacin or diclofenac sodium (5 mg/kg) 30 min before AA inhalation completely inhibited the decrease in lambda 0 induced by AA inhalation, although both drugs did not inhibit the increase in Rrs (P greater than 0.10). In in vitro experiments, AM (5 x 10(6) cells) cells) harvested by bronchoalveolar lavage showed a significant dose-dependent decrease in lambda 0 with prostaglandins (PG) E1 and E2. However, histamine and platelet-activating factor increased lambda 0 significantly (P less than 0.01), whereas PGD2, PGF2 alpha, PGI2, thromboxane A2, leukotrienes B4, C4, and D4, and AA itself were without effect (P greater than 0.50). Furthermore, PGE2 aerosols mimicked AA-induced effects on AM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Antigen-induced T-cell changes: modulation by pharmacologic agents.To determine the effect of pharmacologic modulation of alterations of Peripheral_HP blood T-cell subsets caused by antigen-induced bronchoconstriction, we administered albuterol immediately after antigen-induced bronchoconstriction in a double-blind to protocol to 12 atopic asthmatic subjects. We also administered cromolyn sodium before antigen to 7 of the same subjects. Peripheral_HP blood T-cell subset composition (CD4, CD8, Ia) of a highly purified T-cell preparation was determined before, 24, 48, 72, and 168 h after bronchoconstriction. We found that placebo inhalation immediately after antigen-induced bronchoconstriction did not Affect_ASDPTO subsequent Peripheral_HP blood T-cell subset changes (decrease in CD4+ and increase in Ia+ T lymphocytes). In contrast, inhaled albuterol abolished these T-cell subset changes. Although cromolyn sodium significantly decreased the Severity_HP of antigen-induced bronchoconstriction, it did not Affect_ASDPTO T-cell subset composition changes at the dosage used. We conclude that albuterol can ablate T-cell subset changes associated with antigen-induced bronchoconstriction. Cromolyn sodium ameliorates bronchoconstriction, but has no Affect_ASDPTO on T-cell subset composition changes. This implies that T-cell changes and bronchoconstriction caused by antigen inhalation are mediated through different pathways.

Antigen-induced T-cell changes: modulation by pharmacologic agents.To determine the effect of pharmacologic modulation of alterations of peripheral blood T-cell subsets caused by antigen-induced bronchoconstriction, we administered albuterol immediately after antigen-induced bronchoconstriction in a double-blind to protocol to 12 atopic asthmatic subjects. We also administered cromolyn sodium before antigen to 7 of the same subjects. Peripheral blood T-cell subset composition (CD4, CD8, Ia) of a highly purified T-cell preparation was determined before, 24, 48, 72, and 168 h after bronchoconstriction. We found that placebo inhalation immediately after antigen-induced bronchoconstriction did not affect subsequent peripheral blood T-cell subset changes (decrease in CD4+ and increase in Ia+ T lymphocytes). In contrast, inhaled albuterol abolished these T-cell subset changes. Although cromolyn sodium significantly decreased the severity of antigen-induced bronchoconstriction, it did not affect T-cell subset composition changes at the dosage used. We conclude that albuterol can ablate T-cell subset changes associated with antigen-induced bronchoconstriction. Cromolyn sodium ameliorates bronchoconstriction, but has no affect on T-cell subset composition changes. This implies that T-cell changes and bronchoconstriction caused by antigen inhalation are mediated through different pathways.
[Accelerated desensitization with Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus in Severe_HP asthmatic children. Evaluation after one year of immunotherapy].An homogeneous group of 17 children with Severe_HP Chronic_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were given a rush immunotherapy with standardized Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus extracts. Maintenance dose was injected monthly for one year. Symptom and medication scores as well as functional (lung function tests, specific nasal challenges), immunologic and allergic parameters (skin tests, total serum IgE, specific IgE and IgG4) were recorded before and at the end of the study. Rush immunotherapy was well tolerated in spite of some Moderate_HP systemic adverse reactions. Symptom and medication scores improved in 10 children. Nasal and skin sensitivity decreased in respectively 3 and 7 children. However there was no correlation between the improvement of quality of life and laboratory results. This study shows that specific immunotherapy is possible in children with Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Its efficacy should be assessed by symptom and medication scores.

How much aerosol reaches the lungs of wheezy infants and toddlers?Using sodium cromoglycate as a non-toxic marker, we assessed the delivery of aerosol to nine wheezy infants and seven Healthy_HP adults. The drug was delivered to the infants by face mask and spacer device from a metered dose inhaler, and by face mask and nebuliser to the infants and the adults who breathed though their noses. The concentration of sodium cromoglycate was estimated in timed urine collections to find out how much of the dose was absorbed from the lung. Only 0.13% to 0.61% of the 20 mg nominal dose was detected in the urine, representing an estimated 0.3% to 1.5% deposited in the lung. Nasal filtration of aerosol could be a critical factor in reducing lung deposition.

Effect of 4% lidocaine inhalation in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The effect of 4% lidocaine inhalation was studied in a single-blind fashion in 18 patients with Chronic_HP Stable_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Inhalation of normal saline solution was used as placebo. None of the parameters except flow rate at 50% of vital capacity (V50) showed any statistically significant change from baseline values. V50 at 15 min was significantly lower (p less than 0.05) after 4% lidocaine inhalation. Considering more than 10% change from the baseline value as significant, 8 of 15 patients showed decrease in airway resistance (Raw) and 7 of the 15 patients showed an increase in specific airway conductance (SGaw) after 15 min of inhalation. However, V50 (8/18 patients), flow rate at 25% vital capacity [V25 (6/15 patients], and forced expiratory flow rate at 25-75% of the vital capacity (FEF25-75) (5/15 patients) showed a decrease after 15 min of 4% lidocaine inhalation. No change in pulmonary function was noted after 30 min of lidocaine inhalation. It is concluded from this study that lidocaine produces a small bronchodilatory effect on the large airways and a bronchoconstrictor effect on the small airways after 15 min of inhalation, but this effect is not statistically significant. It can be safely used as topical agent for bronchoscopy in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Effects of exercise on gas exchange in patients recovering from Status_asthmaticus_HP.The effect of exercise on gas exchange was studied in 17 patients (seven male and 10 female) recovering in hospital from Status_asthmaticus_HP. On admission the patients (mean age 26 (SD 8) years) had a mean peak expiratory flow (PEF) of 26.8% (5.7%) predicted, a mean arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) of 8.63 (1.26) kPa, and a mean alveolar-arterial oxygen difference (A-aDO2) of 5.98 (1.34) kPa. Once resting symptoms had resolved (after 3.7 (1.6) days) patients performed a constant load exercise test (100 watts for men, 75 watts for women) on a bicycle ergometer for five minutes. PEF was measured before exercise and at five minute intervals for 30 minutes after exercise. Blood gas tensions were measured on capillary blood before, during, and 10 minutes after exercise. Treatment was not interrupted for this study. Mean PEF at rest was 87.6% (21.1%) predicted and showed no significant change after exercise. Mean PaO2 was 13.13 (1.37) kPa before exercise; it showed no significant change during exercise (13.93 (1.34) kPa) or 10 minutes after exercise (13.50 (2.15) kPa). Mean A-aDO2 also showed no change, being 1.82 (1.31) kPa before exercise, 1.79 (1.27) kPa during exercise, and 2.53 (0.93) kPa after exercise. It is concluded that Moderate_HP exercise carried out shortly after treatment for Status_asthmaticus_HP is unlikely to result in worsening gas exchange during or after exercise if resting PEF, PaO2 and A-aDO2 have attained normal or near normal values.

Asthma_ASDPTO_HP patterns in Saudi Arabian children.In a study of 2006 school children living in two urban areas of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, we used a questionnaire to collect details of age, sex, areas of residence, occupation, education, social class, parental history of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and information relating to parental Smoking_ASDPTO habit. The relative importance of these factors on the likelihood of children having bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was assessed using a linear modelling analysis. The extent to which these factors Affected_HP the Severity_HP of bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was also examined. A number of statistically significant associations between bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and 'breathlessness' (P less than 0.0087), 'Father smoker' (P less than 0.0001), 'usually Cough_HP' (P less than 0.0001), 'pets' (P less than 0.0067) and 'Family_history_HP of Allergy_HP' (P less than 0.007), were found.

[Effect of recombinant gamma interferon on allergic skin reaction and bronchoconstriction].Gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma) has immunosuppressive and immunostimulatory effects. Net results in clinical disease are difficult to predict. We studied possible anti-allergic effects of IFN-gamma in a double blind study in 30 patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. We performed quantitative skin prick and bronchial allergen provocation tests using each patient's main allergen prior to and after 20 injections of either recombinant IFN-gamma (100 micrograms each) or placebo, measuring skin wheal area, specific airway resistance (SRaw) and the maximal expiratory flow at 50% of vital capacity (MEF50). IFN-gamma reduced skin wheal area significantly but had no effect on allergic bronchoconstriction.

[Use of sodium cromoglycate in nebulizations for asthmatic children less than 7 years of age].One of the new ways to treat the inter crisis of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, is the use of Cromolyn (SCG) in spray or in Rothaller and it's necessary that the patient help's in the cooperation to use this medication. Now with SCG in solution to nebulizer is easy to use this medication in young children. We studied 18 boys and girls in 5 different cities of the mexican Republic, all the patient were younger than 7 years old and had Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, they received 20 mg. of SCG in nebulizer 4 time daily up to 12 weeks. At the end of the study we found that the symptoms and the use of symptomatic medication were reduce in important way with statistic significance. We conclude the use SCG in nebulizer is safety and efficacy to treat patient with Chronic_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Assessment of bronchoalveolar cell and mediator response to isocapnic hyperpnea in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that mediators and cells associated with bronchoconstriction or inflammation are locally synthesized and/or released in the airways of asthmatic subjects in response to isocapnic hyperpnea (ISH). Seven atopic, mildly asthmatic subjects were studied. Baseline measurements were reported previously and included forced expiratory volumes, flow rates, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and methacholine reactivity. Approximately 1 yr later, spirometry and BAL were repeated, but BAL was performed immediately after ISH challenge. As indices of inflammation, BAL measurements were made of eosinophils, neutrophils, epithelial cells, leukotrienes B4, C4, D4, and E4, prostaglandins D2, E2, and F2 alpha, thromboxane B2, histamine, and total protein. Compared with baseline, ISH was associated with higher BAL concentrations of the following: leukotriene B4 (10 versus 121 pg/ml, p = 0.02), leukotrienes C4/D4/E4 (46 versus 251 pg/ml, p = 0.02), eosinophils (0.8 versus 2.2%, p = 0.04), and epithelial cells (2.1 versus 6.1%, p = 0.05). Trends toward significant increases were seen in BAL concentrations of neutrophils and prostaglandin D2. No statistically significant increases were found in BAL measurements of total protein, histamine, prostaglandins E2 or F2 alpha, thromboxane B2, lymphocytes, or macrophages. The magnitude of the response to ISH, as measured by change in FEV1, did not correlate with BAL levels of cells or mediators. This study indicates that ISH, even in mildly asthmatic subjects, is associated with airway increases in a spectrum of bronchoactive mediators and inflammatory cells, supporting the observations of others that antagonists of a single mediator are unlikely to have major clinical effectiveness in ISH or exercise-induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Effect of inhaled disodium cromoglycate and albuterol on energy cost of running in asthmatic children.The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of disodium cromoglycate and albuterol on energy cost of running, gas exchange, and ventilation during maximal exercise in children with Exercise-induced_Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (EIA). Twelve children (7.1-15.5 years old) with a history of Mild_HP to Moderate_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and EIA performed three maximal exercise tests on a treadmill: 1) test A, without premedication; 2) test B, after premedication with inhaled disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) (40 mg); 3) test C, after premedication with inhaled albuterol (200 micrograms). The energy cost of running was calculated at each minute of exercise. None of the children were limited by Dyspnea_HP during the run. The post-exercise fall in FEVi after test A was greater than 20% for each child, the mean fall being 32.8 +/- 11.6%, in comparison with 12.6 +/- 8.9% after test B (P less than 0.001) and 2.5 +/- 5.3% after test C (P less than 0.001). There was no difference in the baseline oxygen uptake for the three tests. Maximum oxygen uptake (VO2 peak) decreased from 43.9 +/- 7.7 mL/min/kg in test A to 37.7 +/- 6.0 mL/min/kg in test B (P less than 0.01) and 39.1 +/- 7.2 mL/min/kg in test C (P less than 0.05). Ventilatory anaerobic threshold in tests B and C was significantly lower than in test A (P less than 0.01). Ventilation (L/min) and energy cost of running (O2 mL/kg/m) were significantly lower in tests B and C than in test A at comparable times. Running time was longer in B and C (P less than 0.05) with respect to A.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

The cyclooxygenase theory of Aspirin-induced_Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Aspirin-induced_Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is a distinct clinical syndrome which affects about 10% of adult asthmatics. In these patients aspirin and several other analgesics precipitate asthmatic attacks. The idea that the attacks might result from the specific inhibition of a single enzyme, namely cyclooxygenase, has gained both experimental and clinical support. It stimulated a number of hypotheses on the mechanism of bronchoconstriction. All these hypotheses, here discussed, operate within the framework of the cyclooxygenase theory. Their major assumption is that inhibition of cyclooxygenase triggers specific biochemical reactions which lead to open Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attacks.

Aspirin--relieved Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.It is widely known that there might occur three different responses to the administration of ASA or NSAID to patients with bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP-bronchoconstriction, bronchodilatation or lack of bronchopulmonary action. Nevertheless, the beneficial effect of SAID has been confirmed in patients who are both nonallergic and cortico-dependent asthmatics. Our hypothesis is that in these specific cases the arachidonic acid metabolism is diverted towards cyclo-oxygenase products and that this metabolic diversion leads to an increased production of bronchoconstriction prostaglandins. The administration of NSAID inhibits the cyclo-oxygenase suppressing the enhanced basal production of these bronchoconstrictors and relieving the Bronchospasm_HP. The suspected abnormality in arachidonic acid metabolism would be restricted to the respiratory system.

Is filariasis a trigger for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP?Many Sri Lankan children with Cough_HP and wheeze and Peripheral_HP blood Eosinophilia_HP are treated with diethyl carbamazine (D.E.C.) on the assumption that filaria is the cause. We tried to establish whether filaria can trigger Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and whether D.E.C. improves bronchial reactivity. In 35 symptomatic and 22 asymptomatic children Peripheral_HP blood eosinophil counts, filarial antibody test, stool examination, chest radiography, Allergy_HP skin tests and histamine inhalation tests were performed before and after treatment with D.E.C. Most of the symptomatic children were atopic; 1/3 of all children had helminthiasis, positive filarial antibodies and total eosinophil counts of greater than 2,000. Ten children had chest radiographs suggestive of tropical pulmonary Eosinophilia_HP. Only in those with Recurrent_HP symptoms was there a marked improvement in bronchial reactivity after D.E.C., but baseline peak expiratory flow (P.E.F.) improved in all symptomatic groups. We conclude that 1/3 of the children had filariasis which in an atopic individual may trigger Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Both the anti-inflammatory and the anti-filarial action of D.E.C. probably contribute to improvement of bronchial reactivity.

Childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in Thailand.Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is common in Thai children with a prevalence of about 4%. A prospective study of 2,000 Thai asthmatic children showed boys to be more frequently Affected_HP than girls, and fifty percent of patients experienced their first attack within the first 2 years of life. Attacks usually occurred in winter and the rainy season. 63.15% of patients had Asthma_ASDPTO_HP associated with other allergic diseases and 79.25% had a Family_history_HP of allergic diseases. Positive skin tests to important antigens were noted in 93.7% of cases, and house dust was the most common. Pharmacokinetic studies of theophylline were made in Thai asthmatic children after oral administration revealed that the elimination half-life of theophylline was longer than that observed in subjects in Western countries. Long-term follow up of 247 Thai asthmatic children revealed that in 37.2% of patients, symptoms ceased at the age of 15 years. The factors which indicated a favorable prognosis included male sex, Mild_HP or Moderate_HP illness, negative skin tests or positive skin tests to only a few allergens.

Long-term follow up of 247 Thai asthmatic children revealed that in 37.2% of patients, symptoms ceased at the age of 15 years. The factors which indicated a favorable prognosis included male sex, mild or moderate illness, negative skin tests or positive skin tests to only a few allergens.
Physical conditioning programme for children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Exercise-induced Bronchospasm_HP limits physical activity in most Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic children. Twelve children with Stable_HP Chronic_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were enrolled in a physical conditioning program to improve ventilation mechanics and to promote physical activity. The program consisted of eight weekly sessions of one-and-a-half hours each, followed by three months of weekly swimming lessons. The activities were preceded by a warm-up period and interspersed with rest. Premedication with an aerosol bronchodilator or sodium cromoglycate was allowed before training. Cardiorespiratory status was studied before and after the program. The program was well received by the children with no Bronchospasm_HP. Five showed improvement in lung volumes and/or flow rates. Bronchial liability remained the same. The basal heart rate slowed in four children. No significant Arrhythmia_HP was detected. With continued practice, cardiorespiratory function might improve further. The program should be incorporated as part of the overall management of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Prophylaxis in childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Opinions on the pathogenesis of bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP have changed considerably in recent years. An immunologic mechanism to explain the state of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in asthmatic patients was not widely accepted in the past. However, with increasing knowledge of immunologic, biochemical and neurogenic mechanisms, a better understanding of the pathophysiology of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP has evolved. This has encouraged investigators to develop new drugs to control asthmatic symptoms. The treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP consists of measures to control Acute_HP attacks and to prevent recurrences. We try to present in this paper a comprehensive review of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP prophylaxis in children. This includes environmental control, parent/patient education, physiotherapy/psychotherapy, Allergy_HP extract immunotherapy and drug prophylaxis. The pharmacologic actions, advantages and disadvantages of drugs used for prophylaxis are discussed. A double-blind investigation on the safety and efficacy of Ketotifen among Filipino asthmatic patients demonstrated beneficial results compared with other countries. An algorithm of the use of various drugs in the prophylaxis of childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is presented.

Respiratory symptoms and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in primary school children in Kuala Lumpur.In a cross-sectional study of 7 to 12-year-old primary school children in Kuala Lumpur, the prevalence of Chronic_HP Cough_HP and/or phlegm, persistent wheeze, and doctor-diagnosed Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were 8.0%, 8.0% and 8.7%, respectively. The prevalence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (defined as persistent wheeze and/or doctor-diagnosed Asthma_ASDPTO_HP) was 13.8%. 4.3% experienced at least one episode of chest illness that resulted in inactivity for at least 3 days in the previous year. The mean age of commencement of symptoms in the doctor-diagnosed Asthma_ASDPTO_HP group was 2.75 years. The prevalence of Chronic_HP Cough_HP and/or phlegm and persistent wheeze were highest among Indian children (p less than 0.05). More Malays had been diagnosed as having Asthma_ASDPTO_HP than the other ethnic groups but the differences were not statistically significant. The patients' fathers' low levels of education were associated with Chronic_HP Cough_HP and/or phlegm (p less than 0.05) but not with other complaints. Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was significantly more common among boys than girls. No age differences were noted. Further analysis showed that persistent wheeze and doctor-diagnosed Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were associated with increased likelihood of other respiratory illnesses or doctor-diagnosed Allergy_HP before the age of 2 years.

Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in Singapore children.The incidence of bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP admissions to Singapore's major Paediatric Units has increased over the years. The Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was usually simple but patients with atypical presentations required the demonstration of bronchial lability to confirm the Diagnosis_ASDPTO. National statistics revealed a small but constant number of deaths from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in childhood. Underestimation of Severity_HP and delay in treatment were important contributing factors to deaths from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Immunological aspects of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (prophylaxis).A long follow-up study revealed that convalescent stage children still have the potency to have an immediate type hypersensitivity reaction on exposure to mite antigen, with a high titer of mite specific IgE in their sera, but they are free from asthmatic attacks because of the reduction in the amount of mite antigen in the body, as shown by the reduction in the amount of mite specific IgG. We also made a prospective study to see whether early elimination of the allergen has any beneficial effect on the cessation of the development of allergic diathesis thereafter. Our study suggested that early elimination of food allergen in infancy not only improved clinical manifestations but also had a protective effect on the progression of the allergic march so far as production of reaginic antibodies was concerned: production of total IgE and mite specific IgE was kept to a minimum.

Urinary arginine vasopressin in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP: consideration of fluid therapy.To elucidate the role of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) on water and electrolyte balance in patients with asthmatic attacks, urinary arginine vasopressin (AVP) was assayed in 28 asthmatic patients. In a 3-year-old girl with status asthmaticus who developed a grand mal Seizures_HP in association with Hyponatremia_HP, urinary AVP levels remained high and fluctuated before convulsion; the cause of the convulsion was considered to be water intoxication due to Inappropriate_antidiuretic_hormone_secretion_HP. In 19 of 28 patients with moderately Severe_HP asthmatic attacks, increases in urinary AVP levels occurred before treatment (300 +/- 80 pg/ml vs. 40 +/- 24 pg/ml (normal controls), p less than 0.01); elevated AVP levels tended to fall in response to intravenous fluid therapy (appropriate ADH secretion) in 2 of 6 patients, but did not fall (Inappropriate_antidiuretic_hormone_secretion_HP) in the remaining patients. It is concluded that Inappropriate_antidiuretic_hormone_secretion_HP may occur in asthmatic attacks, and that in such a condition there seems to be a potential risk of water intoxication during fluid therapy, as demonstrated in the present patient.

Special therapy in an institutional hospital.I would like to introduce institutional therapy, a special therapeutic method used in our country for Severe_HP bronchial asthmatic children. Institutional therapy is mainly being used in national and municipal medical facilities. Approximately 2,300 patients receive this treatment yearly. Of the 158 patients who received this treatment in our institution in the past 4 years, 56.3% of them are leading normal lives after hospital discharge. Comparing those with a good prognosis to those with a bad prognosis, the time from Onset_HP of the serious stage to hospitalization is shorter and EIA levels are increased in the former group. Adequate amounts of physical training are effective in improving the patients' functional abilities and promoting confidence; therefore this therapy is highly effective.

Death from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in children.We have recorded 29 cases of death from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in children who had visited the Department of Pediatrics of Doai Memorial Hospital between 1965 and 1987. These cases have been analyzed. They were 18 males and 11 females. The mean age at death was 12.4 years and we found that in later childhood and adolescence the age at death had been increasing since 1973. The duration from final attack to death was very short: less than 1 hour: 21% and less than 2 hours: 50%. About half of the cases could not reach the hospital. Ten cases died within one year after cessation of long-term systemic use of steroid. Severe_HP attacks of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were particularly likely to occur during the reducing period or following cessation of these drugs. The importance of adequate and vigorous initial therapy in Severe_HP asthmatic attacks should be emphasized. The causes of death are as follows: asphyxia: 23 cases (one complicated by Aspiration_HP, one withdrawal syndrome of steroid, one subendocardial haemorrhage and two Pneumothorax_HP cases), Anaphylactic_Shock_HP to ACTH: 1 case, Shock_HP to stimulant: 1 case, following emergency operation: 1 case and unknown: 3 cases.

Treatment of Status_asthmaticus_HP--hormone changes before and after aminophylline i.v. drip therapy.The treatment of Status_asthmaticus_HP is one of the most important factors in controlling the patient with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attacks. We have studied hormone changes in Status_asthmaticus_HP and considered what is the best treatment in the Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attack condition in children. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH), renin activity, and aldosterone activity are elevated in Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attack conditions, and these high levels are correlated with high levels in Wood's clinical score. It is theoretical that patients with Dehydration_HP and Respiratory_failure_HP show such elevation in hormones, and it is well known that under such conditions beta 2-stimulant enhances renin production. From our study, it is concluded that beta 2-stimulant subcutaneous injection must be considered in Status_asthmaticus_HP. In children, aminophylline i.v. drip therapy may be one of the best treatments in Status_asthmaticus_HP.

Inhibition of human allergic skin reactions in vivo by pretreatment with cromolyn (disodium cromoglycate).The effect of cromolyn on allergen-induced allergic skin reactions was studied. Two patients with Allergic_Rhinitis_HP, two patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP and two patients with Allergic_Rhinitis_HP and Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP were included in this study. They were allergic to cedar pollen, house dust mite and house dust, respectively. Scratching with allergen induced wheal and Erythema_HP reactions in each patient. Simultaneous application of allergen and cromolyn solution did not modulate allergic reactions; however, pretreatment with cromolyn solution inhibited allergen-induced wheal and Erythema_HP reactions significantly.

Benefits and problems of a physical training programme for asthmatic patients.The clinical and physiological effects of a medically supervised, indoor physical training programme were investigated in 36 asthmatic subjects aged 16-40 years. After clinical evaluation, lung function assessment, and Progressive_HP incremental exercise testing subjects were randomly allocated to control and training groups. The measurements were repeated after a six week run in period and after a further three months in which those in the training group underwent an indoor training programme. The measurements made at three months were compared with those at the end of the run in period. There was no significant change in anthropometric characteristics, blood lipid profiles, or the provocative concentration of histamine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (histamine PC20) in the group who underwent training. After training there were significant increases in mean maximal oxygen uptake (ml kg-1 min-1) from 23 (5) to 28 (6), oxygen pulse (ml/beat) from 8.8 (2.3) to 10.8 (2.4), and anaerobic threshold (1/min) from 1.11 (0.27) to 1.38 (0.33). These changes were significantly greater in the group undergoing training than in the control group. There was also a significant fall in breathlessness scores (Borg ratings), blood lactate, carbon dioxide output, and minute ventilation during submaximal exercise in the training group, with no change in the control group. The subject's motivation, the initial level of fitness, and the symptom score at the time of training were the most important factors influencing improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness. Thus submaximal physical exercise of controlled Severity_HP, sustained for three months, produced significant improvements in fitness and cardiorespiratory performance that should be advantageous to the exercising asthmatic patient. The availability of medical supervision throughout the exercise programme appears to have contributed to the successful outcome.

The pharmacology of airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation.Hyperresponsiveness is a key abnormality in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and deserves recognition both in the clinical presentation of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and its pathogenesis. Available evidence strongly suggests that inflammatory processes are important in producing this aspect of disordered airway physiology. Pharmacologic studies have greatly increased our knowledge of mechanisms involved in hyperresponsiveness but fall short of a complete explanation of the phenomenon. It is most likely that hyperresponsiveness, as measured in the laboratory, has many different components and that any single mechanism will be an insufficient explanation.

Delivery of prevention and care to asthmatic children.Asthma_ASDPTO_HP-induced mortality increases especially among children; Asthma_ASDPTO_HP induced morbidity impairs their day-to-day life as well as both their physical and psychological development. The treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in children should reduce their symptoms. Although Asthma_ASDPTO_HP medication appears to be efficient in clinical trials such is not the case in clinical practice and public health. The use of drugs and services depends upon the Severity_HP of the disease as well as upon cultural, personal and familial factors. These factors are crucial in the spontaneously inconsistent evolution of this disease. The management of asthmatic children should thus aim: 1) to alter behaviors--of both the patients and their parents who are often in charge of the treatment on a day-to-day basis and of the physician in order to organize a comprehensive therapeutic project for the sick children; 2) to enhance the collaboration between the different paramedical people involved in the treatment; 3) to improve the efficiency of the health system to allow it to achieve its goal of providing high-standard, accessible health care.

Prevention of bronchial hyperreactivity in children.Hyperresponsiveness of the bronchi is defined as an excessive reaction of bronchial mucosa to irritants that do no harm to a Healthy_HP mucosa. Measures to prevent bronchial hyperreactivity in children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and other diseases remain rather ineffective at present. Though progress has been made in some areas.

Allergy_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.An increased prevalence of sensitization to inhalants in asthmatic children is well known. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness is regarded as a major characteristic of bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and is partly acquired during life as a result of a permanent airway irritation to inhaled allergens. We investigated 704 schoolchildren of two different climate areas for existing bronchial hyperreactivity (cumulative carbachol test) and sensitization to ten common aeroallergens (by skin prick test). Additional information on residential factors, passive Smoking_ASDPTO, and clinical symptoms for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was obtained by a standardized interview and compared with the clinical results. Among 35 of 704 children who were considered as asthmatics, 83% demonstrated a sensitization to one or more allergens. On the contrary, only one third of the nonasthmatic population (n = 669) showed sensitization in the skin test. The relative risk for Allergy_HP in children with bronchial hyperreactivity was increased (odds ratio 3.0). Therefore we regard sensitization to common inhalants as an important predictor of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in childhood.

The Progressive_HP nature of childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is the most common Chronic_HP disease in childhood. It has been repeatedly stated that childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is a self-limiting disorder, but this is a misleading and often inaccurate generalization. Prospective studies have demonstrated that many patients who had seemingly outgrown their disease experienced symptoms again as they grew older. In addition, recent evidence suggests that, despite the lack of clinical manifestation of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, there is a persistence of bronchial hyperreactivity for several years. A number of epidemiologic studies have identified factors that seem to be associated with the persistence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP into later childhood or adult life. Information about the effects of treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP on the natural history of the disease is vital. While treatment greatly reduces the morbidity from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, it is not known whether early recognition and aggressive treatment of the disease have any influence on the outcome of the disease later in life.

Determinants and regulating processes in bronchial hyperreactivity.Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) can be considered as a feature of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, although only a loose relationship is present with symptoms and Severity_HP of the disease. Epidemiology of BHR may inform about determining factors in BHR and its role as a risk factor. BHR is found already at a young age, mostly diminishes with age, and increases in many asthmatic patients after midlife. Genetic determinants are suggested by familial segregation and twin studies. Allergy_HP, Respiratory_tract_infection_HP, and cigarette Smoking_ASDPTO are found to induce increase in BHR and to modify its degree at the long run. The mechanisms in BHR are being unraveled gradually. A Chronic_HP inflammation with an important role for eosinophils, mast cells, and others, is thought to modify bronchial mechanisms, such as smooth muscle, epithelium, and autonomic systems. Growing evidence supports that T lymphocytes are implicated and may determine many of the inflammatory cells, such as eosinophils, neutrophils, and mast cells.

Nonpharmacologic means of preventing Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Cessation of Smoking_ASDPTO in the home is one of the most important nonpharmacologic actions to be recommended. There is a highly significant increase in Wheezing_HP, Cough_HP, and Respiratory_tract_infection_HP in children with Smoking_ASDPTO mothers, and this increase is directly proportional to the number of cigarettes smoked. Cord blood IgE levels are increased in babies whose mothers smoke during pregnancy. Other agents, such as sulpur dioxide and chemical pollutants from industrial processes may play a role in the development or exacerbation, of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP symptoms and should be avoided. One of the most interesting areas in Food_Allergy_HP is whether breast feeding causes sensitization or induces tolerance in infants to foods ingested by the mother. There is an increase in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in second-generation immigrant populations who are exposed, from birth, to the Western style of living which increases their exposure to house dust mite. Several studies have shown that month of birth is important in the development of specific Allergies_ASDPTO, for example, in the incidence of birch pollen Allergy_HP in Scandinavia. The presence of a pet in the home at birth is associated with a greater incidence of Allergy_HP to that animal. Our study in asthmatic children has shown a strong association (p less than 0.001) between the presence of allergens in the air in their homes (sampled retrospectively in the month of birth) with a positive skin test to those allergens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Passive Smoking_ASDPTO in childhood--tobacco smoke.Prevalence of cigarette Smoking_ASDPTO varies widely in different countries, ranging, at the age of 13, from 2% to 5% (Sweden, United States) to more than 30% (Australia, Uruguay). Even if the prevalence of smokers among male adolescents is decreasing in western countries, it is increasing among girls and, in developing countries, male adolescent smokers still reach 40% (and up to 70%-80%). The determination of saliva cotinine levels, a product of nicotine metabolism, is an useful indicator of exposure to passive or active Smoking_ASDPTO. In a study of 210 children aged 9-13 years, we found detectable levels of saliva cotinine in 13% of children who lived in nonSmoking_ASDPTO families and denied being regular smokers and in only 60% of children living in families with heavy cigarette consumption. This wide variations of a marker of Smoking_ASDPTO exposure may explain the differences in reported consequences of tobacco smoke in investigations conducted in different places and on different target populations. We later studied the effects of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) in a sample of 166 nine-year-old children. The relationship between parental Smoking_ASDPTO and degree of bronchial responsiveness in males was significant. Also, prick skin test reactivity to allergens was significantly increased in children of Smoking_ASDPTO parents. Many studies concerning the effects of ETS exposure seem to demonstrate that not only the lungs and not only children are Affected_HP even if the difficulty of the epidemiology in such a field must suggest caution in interpreting the results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Prevention of pediatric pulmonary problems: the importance of maternal Smoking_ASDPTO.Although many factors are associated with lower respiratory illnesses in children, few can be identified as likely direct causal influences. Maternal Smoking_ASDPTO has been strongly associated with respiratory morbidity in early life. The relationship is consistent in different studies, and is dose-related. It is also resistant to attempts at statistical control for factors that might confound the association. The effect seems most marked from maternal Smoking_ASDPTO during pregnancy. Stopping young women taking up cigarette Smoking_ASDPTO is a priority preventive medical need.

Airways and air pollution in childhood: state of the art.Correlations between ambient pollutants and health effects, such as observed in SIDS, may in reality be to a larger extent the result of indoor sources. These distinctions between indoor and outdoor sources, while important, do not detract from the overall conclusion that pollution affects the airway in children directly and indirectly. Much still needs to be learned about the permanence of these effects, the mechanism by which the effect is mediated, and the conditions under which some of these effects are maximal. Two approaches seem particularly suited to shed further light on these issues. First, identification of biological markers for exposure to pollutants will yield both more accurate measures of exposure to pollutants and information about health consequences. Second, newer modeling techniques promise to predict health outcomes under a variety of environmental conditions. Shumway et al., for instance, describe a promising model predicting an increase in mortality due to ambient pollutants in the Los Angeles Basin with higher levels under extremes of temperature, especially during cold spells. Time series and factor analyses may further our knowledge as well. In the near future, large cohort studies should begin to reveal the cumulative effects of air pollution on the respiratory system, especially in relation to active Smoking_ASDPTO. Finally, studies in Black children are virtually unavailable. Given their high risk for respiratory illnesses, such studies are sorely needed.

Acute_HP viral Bronchiolitis_HP in infancy: epidemiology and management.Acute_HP Bronchiolitis_HP due to viral agents (RSV, parainfluenza, influenza, adenovirus) is a relatively Frequent_HP disease of infancy. Seasonal epidemic pattern have been recognized, and nosocomial infections in pediatric wards occur. Until age 2 years most children have experienced some form of airway disease attributable to RSV. Some patients require hospital treatment; about 15% of our patients had to be transferred to the intensive care unit. Bronchiolitis_HP seems to be Frequent_HPly the first manifestation of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and we found higher IgG antibody titers to viruses causing Bronchiolitis_HP in children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP than in controls. Retrospective analysis of the charts of 147 cases of Bronchiolitis_HP revealed considerable uncertainty regarding therapeutic concepts. Mainstays of conservative therapy include oxygen, adequate hydration (often IV), and sometimes bronchodilators (based on the clinical impression of effectiveness in the individual patient). Mist therapy and secretolytic agents remain popular, although no clinical effect has been demonstrated. Attention should be directed toward the relief of Upper_airway_obstruction_HP caused by swelling, secretions, and nasogastric tubes. Oxygen administration in infants with coexisting Chronic_HP airway disease (e.g., Borderline_personality_disorder_HP) and Bronchiolitis_HP may cause CO2 retention. Bronchodilators can cause hypoxia and increase bronchial compressibility by reducing smooth muscle tone. However, in Severe_HP cases a trial under pulse oximetry control seems worthwhile. Steroids seem to bring no clinical improvement, except in infants with protracted Wheezing_HP after Bronchiolitis_HP and patients with preexisting Borderline_personality_disorder_HP.

Patient education in asthmatic adults.Despite the advances in the understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms, clinical assessment, and medical treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, an increase of mortality and morbidity has been observed. It is clear from several studies, however, that this discrepancy may be at least partly due to serious defects, among asthmatic patients, in the ability to judge the Severity_HP of their Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, and in the knowledge of medication and the correct action to take, when deterioration occurred. Therefore, to effectively manage Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, structured education programs for adult asthmatics appear to be useful including information about the disease and the medication as well as training of self-management of airflow limitation by the patients. The evaluation of the course of the disease before and after the education revealed a reduction of Severe_HP attacks, Hospitalizations_ASDPTO, and days lost from work in trained asthmatics.

To improve the uncomfortable situation of underdiagnosis and undertreatment and to lower the risk of acquiring irreversible lung damage, an optimal co-working relationship between family doctor and parents, and a patient education program toward that end, is essential.

Pulmonary rehabilitation in an Asthma_ASDPTO_HP clinic.For a small proportion of patients with respiratory disorders, the regular medical care provided by general practitioners and chest physicians does not result in control of respiratory symptoms. In the Dutch Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Center, Davos, Switzerland, two conditions not available in routine medical settings are instrumental in treating patients with Severe_HP respiratory illness. The treatment center is located at 1560 m above sea level in a high altitude climate (low air humidity, low allergen concentration) which helps stabilize respiratory symptoms. Second, an interdisciplinary treatment plan encompasses optimal medical care and psychological interventions (patient education, self-management training). In this treatment facility, we carry out a cohort study on the determinants of the course of respiratory disorders in the adult patients. At admission, at discharge, and at 6-month follow-up, patient are assessed on medical, psychological, and medical outcome variables. At 6-month follow-up, 35% of the patients were readmitted to a hospital for exacerbations of respiratory symptoms. Multivariate analyses point out that both pulmonary function and psychological factors (particularly state Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP and Agoraphobia_HP) predicted admission. Additional data will be presented and the implications for the multidisciplinary treatment will be discussed.

The role of eosinophils in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.During recent years it has become apparent that the eosinophil may represent a powerful effector cell in the pathogenesis of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, particularly in the late asthmatic response. It can be stimulated by a number of stimuli among which PAF appears to be one of the most effective. The eosinophil is a source for a variety of proinflammatory and toxic products with Profound_HP effect in the lungs and airways. These eosinophil products mimic some of the features of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and the strong association of the eosinophil with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP has led to the suggestion that Asthma_ASDPTO_HP would be better classified as "Chronic_HP desquamating eosinophilic Bronchitis_HP." Although the evidence known to date is persuasive many questions still remain unanswered and await further investigation. Future therapeutic approaches in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP may aim at interrupting the mechanisms leading to eosinophil bronchial accumulation and activation.

Definition and assessment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Bronchial obstruction, its reversibility, airway hyperreactivity and inflammation are key variables of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. In clinical practice they can be assessed with repeated noninvasive lung function measurements (spirometry and mucociliary clearance). The asthmatic inflammation in contrast to Chronic_Bronchitis_HP is characterized by increased IgE and eosinophils depending on the disease state (seasonal, perennial, Chronic_HP symptomatic or asymptomatic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP). Based on the above-mentioned clinically applicable measurements, a classification of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, Chronic_HP (obstructive) Bronchitis_HP, and Emphysema_HP is proposed because the three groups of diseases have different etiology and need different prophylactic and symptomatic treatment.

The epidemiology of alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency.Alpha 1-protease inhibitor can exist as over 70 different biochemical variants (the Pi system) which are inherited as autosomal-codominant alleles. The majority of these variants are of no clinical significance. Epidemiologically, the most abundant are Pi types M, S, and Z. Homozygotes of type Z have only 10%-20% of the normal serum concentration of the inhibitor and have an increased risk of developing Emphysema_HP. Cigarette Smoking_ASDPTO is the most important risk factor. A minority of Pi Z homozygotes (10%-20%) develop a form of neonatal Hepatitis_HP and a proportion of these suffer from Cirrhosis_HP in adult life. Heterozygotes of Pi type SZ have about one third of the normal serum alpha 1-protease inhibitor concentration but this phenotype does not in itself appear to be a significant Emphysema_HP risk factor. Heterozygotes of Pi type MZ are thought to have a moderately increased risk of developing Emphysema_HP but only if they smoke; there is also evidence for an increased risk of Cirrhosis_HP among subjects of type MZ. No excessive risk appears to be attached to the MS phenotype. Cumulative survival curves have suggested that type Z homozygotes have a poor prognosis but such estimates are based on clinic or hospital patients who already have respiratory symptoms. Calculations based on population frequencies however, suggest that about 90% of the total number of type Z subjects are not accounted for in such surveys. Their whereabouts remains unclear at present; some will undoubtedly have died of liver or Abnormal_lung_morphology_HP but it is possible that the majority escape and live undetected among the general population.

Postural mechanisms in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP: importance for Nocturnal_HP symptoms.The supine Position_HP impairs ventilatory function in patients with ongoing Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The response is dual: an immediate decrease on lying down, present in Healthy_HP persons as well, and a Progressive_HP decrease specific for asthmatics. The changes are counteracted by bronchodilators, but are not linked to a decreased plasma adrenaline level when supine. The Progressive_HP decrease is tentatively explained by an increased vagal tone induced by the resting body Position_HP, and is likely to be a key factor in Nocturnal_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Gas exchange abnormalities in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.There has been considerable interest over the last years in gas exchange abnormalities that occur in patients with bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, particularly during an Acute_HP attack. These are essentially characterized by Moderate_HP to Severe_HP Hypoxemia_HP and Hypocapnia_HP caused by considerable ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) mismatch. Using the multiple inert gas elimination technique, the baseline pattern of VA/Q distribution reveals a bimodal bloodflow distribution of VA/Q ratios but no shunt. Inhaled salbutamol seems to be an efficient and safe therapeutic approach, owing to the lack of deleterious effect on VA/Q inequality. Following intravenous salbutamol there is development of further VA/Q mismatch for the same degree of bronchodilation, the resulting deleterious effect on PaO2 being offset by the improvement in mixed venous PO2 due to increased cardiac output.

Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, Bronchitis_HP and Rhinitis_HP, Chronic_HP Obstructive_lung_disease_HP, and allergic alveolitis, respectively, were observed in exposed workers. Inhalation challenge tests with isocyanates found some 14% of symptomatic persons immunologically sensitized. At and above current threshold limit values (10 ppb) there is a risk of lung function deterioration also in asymptomatic workers.

Management of Chronic_HP airway obstruction: theophylline--is it still necessary?Theophylline is a second-line drug for the symptomatic treatment of obstructive pulmonary diseases. It appears to be of particular value in the treatment of the more Severe_HP cases of airway obstruction. The likelihood of a therapeutic benefit and the safety of drug therapy can be increased markedly by an individually optimized theophylline therapy, that is, individual dosage and time of dosing, and monitoring the serum concentrations.

Management of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Chronic_HP airflow limitation: are methylxanthines obsolete?The widespread popularity of methylxanthine derivatives should be reassessed in light of current evidence. These drugs are relatively weak bronchodilators, respiratory muscle stimulants and inotropic agents and adverse effects, sometimes life threatening, occur fairly frequently. In contrast, beta-2 adrenergic and anticholinergic bronchodilator aerosols used in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP or Chronic_HP Obstructive_lung_disease_HP, and the prophylactic anti-inflammatory aerosols of corticosteroids and cromolyn provide a spectrum of therapeutic choices which address both the inflammatory and bronchoconstrictor components of Acute_HP and Chronic_HP airflow limitation. Aerosol bronchodilators, in general, are more potent, are virtually free of important side effects, and do not require costly serum level monitoring. Adrenoceptor agonists, together with inhaled steroids, should be considered first-line drugs of choice in managing patients with reversible airflow obstruction associated with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP or Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP, while methylxanthines should be relegated to the Position_HP of third or fourth line drugs, if they are to be used at all. If they are, they should be used with great caution and close patient supervision and, even then, only if benefit, over and above the aerosol bronchodilators and inhaled anti-inflammatory agents can be demonstrated objectively.

Use of different inhalation devices in children.Many studies in which patient's inhaler use technique has been studied have shown that one of the major problems patients have, in using an inhaler correctly, is that of Poor_coordination_HP of inhaler actuation with inspiration. We have studied a new breath-actuated inhaler ("Autohaler" 3M Riker) which is designed to ensure correct coordination automatically. This study involves 100 children (aged 3-10 years) and includes both normal children and asthmatic patients. None of these children have previous experience using any type of inhaler. Each child is taught to use the "Autohaler" containing a placebo only. A video film is employed in order to standardize the teaching technique. Once the child is able to operate the new inhaler correctly, he or she inspires through an "Autohaler" unit specially modified so that the inspiratory flow rate and the volume of air inhaled is measured by a pneumotachograph in series with the inhaler. The time point, within the inspiratory cycle, at which the inhaler is triggered is also recorded. The majority of children older than 7 years were able to use the "Autohaler" after a few minutes instruction. Therefore, this is a valuable alternative in this age group.

Aerosol deposition in the alveolar space.The fate of inhaled drugs depends on the specifications of the aerosol, the drug itself, the conditions of aerosolization, and the presence of Abnormal_lung_morphology_HP. There are still many points to be elucidated before aerosols can be used more reliably in the treatment of respiratory or nonrespiratory conditions.

Anaphylactic challenge causes eosinophil accumulation in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of guinea pigs. Modulation by betamethasone, phenidone, indomethacin, WEB 2086, and a novel antiallergy agent, SCH 37224.Eosinophil infiltration into bronchoalveolar areas of the lung has been assessed in guinea pigs sensitized to ovalbumin (OA) and then challenged with the aerosolized antigen. Cell content, histamine, and guinea pig albumin (GPA) have been measured in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from these animals. Extensive eosinophil accumulation resulted from sensitization followed by OA challenge; monocytes that initially accounted for greater than 80% of the BAL cells remained essentially constant, and neutrophils comprised less than 3% of the population throughout. Eosinophils were elevated at 3 h, peaked with a fivefold increase at 24 h, and remained elevated for at least 7 days. Histopathologic changes observed in lungs taken from sensitized guinea pigs 24 h after OA challenge confirm this Eosinophilia_HP. Increased histamine and GPA were detected only at 5 min. Oral treatment with betamethasone (ED50 = 0.4 mg/kg), phenidone (ED50 = 15 mg/kg), Sch 37224 (ED50 = 0.5 mg/kg), and WEB 2086 (ED50 = 4 mg/kg) decreased eosinophil accumulation in the BAL fluid, indicating roles for 5-lipoxygenase products and PAF in this multimediator-dependent model of allergic inflammation. On the other hand, 4 mg/kg of indomethacin increased total cells with no effect on eosinophils, precluding a major role for cyclooxygenase products. Sch 37224, an antileukotriene agent and an orally active novel antiallergy agent in sheep, guinea pigs, and humans, is as potent as betamethasone at blocking eosinophil infiltration, suggesting that it may also suppress human pulmonary inflammation.

Acid-base disturbances in Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The clinical features, arterial blood gases, and acid-base profile were examined in 229 consecutive episodes of Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in 170 patients who required hospitalization. A simple Respiratory_Alkalosis_HP was the most common acid-base disturbance, occurring in 48 percent of the episodes. Metabolic_Acidosis_HP, either alone or as part of a mixed disturbance, was noted in 28 percent. Of 60 episodes presenting with respiratory Acidosis_HP, 37 (62 percent) had a coexistent Metabolic_Acidosis_HP. Metabolic_Acidosis_HP was more likely to occur in male subjects and in patients with evidence of more Severe_HP airflow obstruction. Patients with Metabolic_Acidosis_HP had an average anion gap of 15.8 mEq/L; these patients were more hypoxemic than those without Metabolic_Acidosis_HP and there was a significant inverse correlation between the anion gap and the degree of Hypoxemia_HP. We conclude that Metabolic_Acidosis_HP is a common finding in Acute_HP, Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and suggest that the pathogenesis of lactic Acidosis_HP is multifactorial and includes contributions from lactate production by respiratory muscles, tissue hypoxia, and intracellular Alkalosis_HP.

Helium-oxygen mixtures in intubated patients with Status_asthmaticus_HP and Respiratory_Acidosis_HP.Seven patients with Status_asthmaticus_HP intubated for Respiratory_failure_HP who had elevated airway pressures and persistent Respiratory_Acidosis_HP were successfully ventilated using a mixture of 60 percent helium and 40 percent oxygen. All patients experienced a rapid reduction in airway pressures, CO2 retention, and resolution of Acidosis_HP while breathing a helium-oxygen mixture. There were no untoward effects. Helium-oxygen mixtures improve ventilation by reducing the Reynolds number and reducing density dependent resistance. Helium's beneficial effects are due to its high kinematic viscosity, high binary diffusion coefficient for CO2, and high diffusivity. Helium-oxygen mixtures should be considered for use in mechanically ventilated asthmatics with Respiratory_Acidosis_HP who fail conventional therapy.

[Study of bronchial reactivity using dry, cold air and eucapnic Hyperventilation_HP].The paper is concerned with diagnostic value provocation test with cold dry air and eucapnic Hyperventilation_HP for testing bronchial reactivity. Forty Healthy_HP subjects, 90 patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, 20 with Chronic_Bronchitis_HP, 2 with sarcoidosis, 14 with pollenosis, one with mucoviscidosis and 22 with dispnoa or long-lasting Nonproductive_Cough_HP were tested. The total of 149 provocations have been carried out in patients and 40 in Healthy_HP subjects. Airways resistance after provocation with cold dry air and eucapnic Hyperventilation_HP in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is increased over 100% in 13 (14%), over 200% in 12 (13%), over 300% in 25 (26%) and over 500% in 40 (47%) patients. Less intensive Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic attack was provoked in 14 (15%), Moderate_HP attack in 18 (20%) and Severe_HP attack in 58 (65%) patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Provocation time lasted from 2 to 9.9 min. Inspired air temperature ranged from -23 degrees C to -26 degrees C. Airway resistance was measured before and after provocation by means of Bronchoscreen. Central_HP airway resistance was increased in 2 patients, Peripheral_HP resistance in 78, and both resistances in 10 patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The results pointed out that provocation with cold dry air and eucapnic Hyperventilation_HP resulted in bronchial hyperreactivity exclusively in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, and the test was positive in 100% of patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Abnormal mucociliary action in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Bronchiectasis_HP.Nasal mucociliary clearance (NMCC) time was measured in four groups of patients: asthmatics with Allergic_Rhinitis_HP, asthmatics without Rhinitis_HP, Bronchiectasis_HP and normal subjects. The saccharin method was used for the study. The NMCC time was Prolonged_HP significantly in the asthmatic groups and group with Bronchiectasis_HP when compared with control subjects (P less than 0.001). It is likely that the impaired mucociliary clearance is due to a combination of mucus abnormality and ciliary malfunction.

Resistant Status_asthmaticus_HP in children.Use of halothane anesthesia for treating Respiratory_failure_HP caused by Status_asthmaticus_HP in children is highly controversial. Previous reports suggest that bronchodilation occurs within minutes of administration. This report describes the case of a child who received five and a half hours of halothane in conjunction with isoproterenol and theophylline to reverse Respiratory_failure_HP. Halothane did not significantly improve ventilation, and it was associated with significant hemodynamic complications. The use of newer beta-2-agonists and anticholinergics is discussed.

Asthma_ASDPTO_HP: the pulse is not the paradox.Some interesting, unusual features of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP are discussed: that patients may be better able to evaluate the Severity_HP of their Asthma_ASDPTO_HP than physicians; that expiratory obstruction indirectly increases the work of inspiration; that 1 of the responses to airflow obstruction is Hyperventilation_HP; that Localized_HP areas of airflow obstruction may cause increased ventilation/perfusion ratios by decreasing perfusion more than ventilation; that increasing tidal volume may cause a reduction in alveolar ventilation; and, finally, that there is evidence that Asthma_ASDPTO_HP has worsened in recent years, despite advances in the understanding and treatment of this disease.

The time course of bronchoconstriction in asthmatics during and after isocapnic Hyperventilation_HP.We studied the effect of changing the duration of isocapnic Hyperventilation_HP on the time course of bronchoconstriction in five subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Each subject performed Hyperventilation_HP challenges of 4, 8, and 16 min. No significant bronchoconstriction occurred until the Hyperventilation_HP was stopped, regardless of its duration. We found increased bronchoconstriction as the duration of Hyperventilation_HP increased. The declines in FEV1 (mean +/- SD) from baseline were 13 +/- 10%, 22 +/- 7%, and 29 +/- 12% for 4, 8, and 16 min of Hyperventilation_HP, respectively (1 versus 3, p less than 0.01). Mean times after Hyperventilation_HP until maximal bronchoconstriction were 12 +/- 4 min, 9 +/- 6 min, and 6 +/- 4 min. We also found slight bronchodilation during the first 4 min of Hyperventilation_HP. After 2 and 4 min of Hyperventilation_HP, the FEV1 was 103 +/- 5% and 103 +/- 3% of baseline, respectively (both p less than 0.05, compared to baseline). We conclude that increasing the duration of Hyperventilation_HP delays the Onset_HP of bronchoconstriction but causes greater bronchoconstriction once the Hyperventilation_HP is stopped. These results suggest that either Hyperventilation_HP itself inhibits bronchoconstriction or that the mechanisms that induce bronchoconstriction in response to Hyperventilation_HP operate after, rather than during, Hyperventilation_HP.

15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid is the major arachidonic acid metabolite in human bronchi: association with airway epithelium.15(S)-Hydroxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) was by far the most abundant metabolite of arachidonic acid in chopped human bronchi, as identified by reverse phase HPLC, uv spectrometry, and GC/MS. The quantitation of monohydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (mono-HETEs) was performed by the use of 16(S)-hydroxy-9(Z),12(Z),14(E)-heneicosatrienoic acid as internal standard. Thus, significant amounts of 15-HETE were obtained in incubations of bronchi in buffer alone, but the addition of exogenous arachidonic acid (3-100 microM), dose-dependently increased the formation, with maximal levels reached at around 10 min. In contrast, challenge with ionophore A23187 or anti-human IgE did not stimulate the production of 15-HETE in the bronchi. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid inhibited the production of 15-HETE, whereas indomethacin did not. Small amounts of 8,15-diHETEs were detected in incubations with exogenous 15H(P)ETE. Lipoxins were however not detected under any of the incubation conditions used. Furthermore, removal of the airway epithelium substantially diminished the production of 15-HETE in the bronchi. Finally, bronchi were obtained from three patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, and the amounts of 15-HETE in these specimens were significantly higher than those found in tissues from nonasthmatics. Also, in Peripheral_HP lung parenchyma and pulmonary blood vessels 15-HETE was the major mono-HETE after stimulation with arachidonic acid but the levels were about 10 times lower than in the bronchi. As another difference, challenge of the parenchyma with the ionophore A23187 made 5-HETE the predominant mono-HETE. Taken together, airway epithelium appears to be the major source of 15-HETE in the human lung and the findings in specimens of asthmatics raise the possibility that 15-HETE somehow is involved in airway inflammation.

[Respiration of patients with Chronic_HP_lung_disease_HP at 500 and 1500 meter above sea level].There is plentiful literature on respiration at high altitude (3000-8000 m above sea level) and its cardiopulmonary sequelae. But little is known about changes in ventilation and in pulmonary gas exchange at altitudes of 1,000-2,000 m above sea level. We studied 68 patients 500 and 1,500 m above sea level. On the arrival of the patients at 534 m above sea level we measured the arterial blood gases, pulse rate, respiratory rate and a breathing score. The same measurements were repeated on arrival at 1,500 m above sea level. A lung function test (FEV1, FVC, PEF, MEF 25-75) was also performed. The patients were divided into three groups: asthmatics, Chronic_HP bronchitics and restrictive patients. A control group was formed of patients without Abnormal_lung_morphology_HP. Within all groups, the pO2 and the pCO2 diminishes significantly, no significant difference between the groups was found. In patients with Abnormal_lung_morphology_HP oxygen saturation changes from 94.1% to 91.8% (Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP) and from 95.3% to 93.4% (restrictive patients). Age, Smoking_ASDPTO habits, lung function test and blood gases at 534 m are not predictors of the blood gases at altitude in Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP patients. But patients with restrictive Abnormal_lung_morphology_HP show a positive correlation between age and change in pO2, as well as between Severity_HP of the restrictive disease and the change in oxygen saturation. The change of pO2 in Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP patients is not relevant clinically, as there is only minimal change in oxygen saturation. We conclude that patients of all degrees of Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP and patients with light to Moderate_HP restrictive Abnormal_lung_morphology_HP can safely tolerate a difference in altitude from 534 to 1,500 m.
[Respiration of patients with chronic lung disease at 500 and 1500 meter above sea level].There is plentiful literature on respiration at high altitude (3000-8000 m above sea level) and its cardiopulmonary sequelae. But little is known about changes in ventilation and in pulmonary gas exchange at altitudes of 1,000-2,000 m above sea level. We studied 68 patients 500 and 1,500 m above sea level. On the arrival of the patients at 534 m above sea level we measured the arterial blood gases, pulse rate, respiratory rate and a breathing score. The same measurements were repeated on arrival at 1,500 m above sea level. A lung function test (FEV1, FVC, PEF, MEF 25-75) was also performed. The patients were divided into three groups: asthmatics, chronic bronchitics and restrictive patients. A control group was formed of patients without lung disease. Within all groups, the pO2 and the pCO2 diminishes significantly, no significant difference between the groups was found. In patients with lung disease oxygen saturation changes from 94.1% to 91.8% (COPD) and from 95.3% to 93.4% (restrictive patients). Age, smoking habits, lung function test and blood gases at 534 m are not predictors of the blood gases at altitude in COPD patients. But patients with restrictive lung disease show a positive correlation between age and change in pO2, as well as between severity of the restrictive disease and the change in oxygen saturation. The change of pO2 in COPD patients is not relevant clinically, as there is only minimal change in oxygen saturation. We conclude that patients of all degrees of COPD and patients with light to moderate restrictive lung disease can safely tolerate a difference in altitude from 534 to 1,500 m.
[Therapy of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP during pregnancy].Asthma_ASDPTO_HP has been reported to occur in 0.4-1% of pregnant women. A number of clinical studies have attempted to clarify the effect of pregnancy on the course of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Taken together, there is little consistent evidence that pregnancy profoundly influences the Severity_HP of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, except in Occasional_HP individuals. The goals of therapy in managing Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in a pregnant women are identical to those in a nonpregnant woman with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Management of pregnant women with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP aims at preventing Recurrent_HP attacks of Wheezing_HP, Acute_HP Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic attacks, and Respiratory_failure_HP. Recent studies suggest that inflammation in the airway walls may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. It is increasingly apparent that several different cells, particularly eosinophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, produce a variety of mediators that interact in a complex way to produce a number of pathologic effects. Therefore, the primary treatment should involve antiinflammatory drugs. At present, inhaled corticosteroids appear to be the most effective therapy. Cromolyn sodium may also have an antiinflammatory effect. On the other hand, beta 2-sympathomimetics are the most effective bronchodilators available, followed by theophylline. None of these anti-Asthma_ASDPTO_HP drugs is harmful in usual doses, to either woman or fetus.

[Clinical effects of theophylline in the therapy of intractable asthmatic children. II. Theophylline therapy and behavior problems in children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].This study examined the relationship between long-term theophylline therapy and behavior problems in 14 asthmatic children that includes 5 intractable cases and 24 non-asthmatic children. asthmatic children have received theophylline therapy and cromolyn inhalation for 3.6 +/- 3.8 years. Subjects were tested on neuropsychologic batteries; behavior problems and personality of children questionnaire, child behavior checklist, caffeine-like side effects questionnaire, manifest Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP scale, visual attention test, Uchida-Kraepelin test and soft neurological signs. These tests were repeated with an interval of 1 to 12 weeks. Parents noted caffeine-like side effects, stomach ache and difficulty in sleeping, in their child during the theophylline therapy. The caffeine-like side effects decreased after stopping theophylline therapy. The rate of mistake in Uchida-Kraepelin test for the asthmatic group and for the intractable cases was significantly higher than that of the control group. Time of the sequential finger thumb opposition of the soft neurological signs was significantly Prolonged_HP in asthmatic group. There was no significant change in the other tests between asthmatic and non-asthmatic children and before and after stopping theophylline therapy. It seems that behavior problems and learning disability observed in the asthmatic children are due to the pathogenesis or symptoms of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP rather than the effect of long-term theophylline therapy.

Enhanced arachidonic acid metabolism and human neutrophil migration in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.In Stable_HP state asthmatic patients (AP) without any airway obstruction, the capacity of Peripheral_HP blood polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) to produce 5-lipoxygenase metabolites and to migrate, was investigated and compared with the response in Healthy_HP subjects (HS). After calcium-ionophore A23187 stimulation, PMN from AP and HS produced LTB4, its hydroxylated derivatives: omega-OH-and omega-CO2H-LTB4) (omega-LTB4, i.e 6-trans-LTB4 and 5,6-diHETE isomers, and 5-HETE. We found an increase in LTB4 (+59%), omega-LTB4 (+39%), 6-trans-LTB4 (+128%), and free 5-HETE (+63%) generation of AP as compared with HS. Unstimulated migration was enhanced in AP (122 +/- 27 PMN/10 high power fields (hpf) in AP versus 74 +/- 25 PMN/10 hpf in HS, p less than 0.025) and suggested a greater capacity of PMN from AP to migrate. This was confirmed by the PAF-induced chemotaxis studies which showed, in AP, a greater PAF-sensitivity of PMN (10(-6) M versus 10(-5) M in HS) and a greater chemotaxis response (600 +/- 50 PMN versus 200 +/- 35 PMN in HS). In AP, we compared the capacity of PMN to generate LTB4 and 5-HETE with their capacity to migrate. We found an inverse correlation (r = 0.86, p less than 0.007) of intracellular free 5-HETE with chemotaxis to PAF.

[Aberrant expression of HLA-DR antigens of the MHC class II in bronchial epithelial cells in asthmatic patients].The study of cellular events in the bronchi of asthmatic patients shows significant epithelial destruction. The ciliated cells are more often destroyed than others in the respiratory epithelium. Using highly specific monoclonal antibodies, we detected that the epithelial cells were positive for HLA-DR antigen expression, whereas those from Healthy_HP subjects were negative. The aberrant expression could be explained by the presence of T lymphocytes in the asthmatic bronchial mucosa. The activated lymphocytes (CD4+) are known to release gamma interferon, which is a lymphokine that induces or enhances the expression of HLA-DR antigens. These cells, which are known to mediate cytotoxicity in an Ag-specific and Ia-restricted way, could take part in the shedding process of epithelial cells in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Physiological assessment of inflammation in the Peripheral_HP lung of asthmatic patients.Even the asymptomatic asthmatic person with normal lung function may have Peripheral_HP airway obstruction and inflammation along with hyperresponsiveness to nonspecific challenges. The airway caliber change induced immediately following a deep inhalation (DI) appears to relate to the mechanism (inflammation vs. smooth muscle constriction) and site (Peripheral_HP vs. more Central_HP) of obstruction and the degree of hyperresponsiveness. Data are presented and reviewed that support the notion that relative hysteresis of parenchyma (including Peripheral_HP airways and alveolar ducts) and airways (more Central_HPly located, conducting airways) can explain the magnitude and sign of airway caliber change that follow a DI in asthmatic subjects.

Cold air challenge for measuring airway reactivity in children: lack of a late asthmatic reaction.Cold air challenge (CACh) for measuring airway reactivity uses respiratory heat or water loss as a bronchoconstrictor stimulus; this stimulus is also important for the development of Exercise-induced_Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, for which late asthmatic reactions (LARs) have been described. At 1200 hr on day 1, 22 children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP started to record their peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) in 3 hr intervals until 0900 hr on day 2. At 1000 hr, they underwent a standardized 4 min CACh. Children then inhaled salbutamol and continued to record PEFR until 0900 hr on day 3. As a bronchodilator effect, PEFR measurements were significantly higher 2, 5, and 8 hr after CACh, but subsequently did not differ significantly from pre-CACh values. At 5 hr after CACh, individual values ranged from 95 to 137% of the corresponding pre-CACh measurements, at 8 hr from 94 to 150%, and at 11 hr from 80 to 121%. This random sample of children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP demonstrated no LAR after CACh.

Guinea pig ozone-induced airway hyperreactivity is associated with increased N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.High level ozone exposure is known to cause Acute_HP, neutrophil-independent airway hyperreactivity in the guinea pig. The precise biochemical mechanisms involved remain unclear. Because of its potential pathophysiologic importance, we examined whether a lysosomal hydrolase, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAGA) was released from the airways in vivo and from bronchoalveolar cells, specifically macrophages. Muscarinic reactivity was determined by measuring specific airway resistance (sRaw) in response to increasing doses of aerosolized acetylcholine in guinea pigs that were either exposed to air or to ozone (3.0 ppm, 2 h). The ozone-exposed animals showed substantial muscarinic hyperreactivity 30 min after exposure. In addition, both total and percent released NAGA in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained immediately after reactivity testing were significantly greater in the ozone-exposed group. It was also found that substantially more NAGA was released from mixed bronchoalveolar lavage cells in response to 20 microM A23187. Moreover, bronchoalveolar macrophages of ozone-exposed animals secreted more NAGA upon stimulation in vitro by either 20 microM A23187 or 200 micrograms/ml opsonized zymosan. We conclude that ozone-induced airway hyperreactivity in guinea pigs is associated with the presence of increased NAGA activity in bronchoalveolar fluid. Our data suggest that bronchoalveolar macrophages may, at least in part, be responsible for release of this enzyme into the airways after ozone exposure.

The influence of cyclooxygenase inhibition on the loss of bronchoconstrictor response to repeated bradykinin challenge in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Bradykinin is a naturally occurring nonapeptide which may contribute to the pathogenesis of bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. When inhaled by asthmatic subjects it is a potent bronchoconstrictor, but with repeated challenge airways responsiveness to the peptide decreases markedly. In vitro studies suggest that loss of bradykinin responsiveness may be due to the secondary generation of relaxant prostanoids. We have used the potent cyclooxygenase inhibitor flurbiprofen to investigate the potential role of prostanoid generation in bradykinin tachyphylaxis in eight asthmatic patients. The effects of oral flurbiprofen (150 mg) and matched placebo were observed on two consecutive dose response studies with inhaled bradykinin and histamine in a double-blind, randomized study. Venous blood was taken to measure the serum concentration of thromboxane B2 (TxB2) as a check on the extent of cyclooxygenase blockade achieved by flurbiprofen. Following recovery from the first challenge with bradykinin, the asthmatic airways showed a reduced response to a second challenge with this nonapeptide, the provocative concentration producing a 20% fall from baseline (PC20) increasing from 0.07 to 0.42 mg.ml-1 (p less than 0.01). The airway response to inhaled histamine after the second bradykinin challenge was not significantly changed. In the presence of demonstrable cyclooxygenase inhibition, flurbiprofen failed to prevent the development of reduced responsiveness to bradykinin observed on the second challenge, the PC20 increasing from 0.10 to 0.48 mg.ml-1 (p less than 0.01). This study demonstrates that repeated exposure to inhaled bradykinin results in loss of the bronchoconstrictor response which appears specific for this agonist and not secondary to the increased generation of protective prostanoids.

Alpha-1-antitrypsin levels and prevalence of Pi variant phenotypes in adult Nigerian asthmatics.Alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) phenotypes and serum levels were determined in 99 asthmatic patients and 100 control subjects. The phenotypes encountered were PiMM 74% in asthmatics, 98% in controls; PiMZ 19% in asthmatics, 1% in controls; PiMW 3% in asthmatics, 0% in controls; and PiLM 2% in asthmatics, 1% in controls. There was one asthmatic patient with the homozygous deficient phenotype ZZ. The result revealed that there were more deficient heterozygous phenotypes in the asthmatic group than the control group. There was also a positive correlation between the number of patients with deficient phenotypes and the Severity_HP of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (P less than 0.02). Analysis of the serum A1AT levels revealed that as a group the asthmatic patients had significantly lower A1AT levels (1.97 +/- 0.18 g/l) than the control group (2.21 +/- 0.15 g/l) (P less than 0.01). However, there was no statistically significant difference in the A1AT serum levels of patients with P1MM phenotype and the control of the same phenotype. Statistical analysis could not be done for the other phenotypes because of the small number of subjects. Apart from the patient with PiZZ the A1AT serum levels encountered in the study were not low enough to justify replacement therapy with alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor in our asthmatic patients.

The role of disodium cromoglycate-metered dose aerosol inhaler in the management of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in Thai children.Metered dose aerosol inhaler of disodium cromoglycate (Intal) has been recently introduced to facilitate the ease of administration of the drug over its previous spincap formulation. We evaluated the efficacy of regular use of metered dose inhaler of disodium cromoglycate (DSCG-MDI) in the daily management of Thai asthmatic children. The study comprised nineteen children with the age range of 8-15 years (mean 11.6 years). During a two week baseline period, the patients recorded their baseline symptom scores, requirement of their Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Medications_ASDPTO (medication scores) and their morning/evening peak flow (PEFR) readings. Thereafter, DSCG-MDI was prescribed at the dosage of two puffs (1 mg/puff) four times daily for eight weeks. Patients were examined at two week intervals at which daily score cards along with PEFR records were collected. Significant reduction in the medication scores and in the requirement for maintenance bronchodilators were noted (p less than 0.01) within two weeks of use of the DSCG-MDI. Morning and evening PEFR's increased significantly and this increase reached statistical significance at 4 weeks after the initiation of the treatment (p less than 0.01). No side effects were reported throughout the study; the aerosol was well tolerated. In this open study DSCG-MDI, at a dose of 1 mg four times daily, significantly improved Asthma_ASDPTO_HP symptoms along with PEFR readings in Thai asthmatic children and reduced the need for concomitant Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Medications_ASDPTO.

Morning and evening PEFR's increased significantly and this increase reached statistical significance at 4 weeks after the initiation of the treatment (p less than 0.01). No side effects were reported throughout the study; the aerosol was well tolerated. In this open study DSCG-MDI, at a dose of 1 mg four times daily, significantly improved asthma symptoms along with PEFR readings in Thai asthmatic children and reduced the need for concomitant asthma medications.
Long-term therapy in childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP: clinical and auxological effects.The authors studied the effect of different therapeutical regimens on the growth of children suffering from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. These patients were subdivided into four groups of ten patients according to their therapeutic regimens: Group A = ketotifene (1 mg, two times/day), Group B = diproprionate beclomethasone + salbuthamol (100 + 200 mcg, 3 times/day), Group C = ketotifene + diproprionate beclomethasone, Group D = disodiumcromoglycate (20 mg, 3 times/day). The patients were followed for at least 1 year. Our study has shown that all the children treated with the four different regimens had a normal growth and growth velocity.

The effect of intravenous doxofylline or aminophylline on gastric secretion in Duodenal_ulcer_HP patients.The aim of this study was to compare the effects upon gastric secretion of therapeutic doses of aminophylline, with doxofylline, a new xanthine derivative proposed for the treatment of Chronic_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Twelve patients with endoscopically-proven healed Duodenal_ulcer_HP were studied twice under double-blind conditions in cross-over experiments. In a 1-hour infusion, six patients received either 240 mg aminophylline i.v. or 200 mg doxofylline i.v., and six received either 240 mg aminophylline i.v. or 400 mg doxofylline i.v. Compared with basal gastric secretion, for the hour after the infusion 240 mg aminophylline i.v. stimulated gastric acid output by a mean 213% (P less than 0.01) and mean pepsin output by 129% (P less than 0.01). Intravenous doxofylline did not stimulate a significant increase of either acid or pepsin output (200 mg: acid output +4%, pepsin output +10%; 400 mg: acid output +25%, pepsin output +27%). These findings suggest that doxofylline, unlike aminophylline, has a low secretagogue activity and it may be more suitable for asthmatic patients with Peptic_ulcer_HP disease.

[asthmatic illness: basic trial treatment by ketotifen (apropos of 48 cases)].This study draws on 48 Asthma_ASDPTO_HP files of which 68.7% were of allergic origin, and has led to the following conclusions: Ketotifene is particularly active on mainly allergic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, and 72.7% of the results obtained were good. the younger the Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, the more effective the product effectiveness is greater where the sickness is recent and the patient not on medication the economy in corticoids is significant: 60% on average, it can attain 100%. On the other hand, the medicine has little effect on mainly non-allergic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, such as infectious Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, late Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and the recurrence of former Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, all difficult to treat. One author stresses that results improve as etiological factors diminish. While awaiting the fruit of progress and research in providing other medicine to conclusively conquer Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, Ketotifene constitutes a new, choice weapon for the therapeutic arsenal ranged against the causes of this sickness.

Epidemiological study of mites and guanine in house dust.The total number of mites, and the amount of guanine contained in house dust was determined in samples obtained from homes with and without asthmatic patients in Yokohama City. The data were quantified and their possible association with various factors within the home was examined. The largest number of mites and the greatest amount of guanine were most strongly associated with carpet floor coverings, followed by tatami mats, and then by wooden flooring. A multi-variate analysis revealed that the major factors influencing the number of mites and the amount of guanine in homes were the living room flooring, and the age of the house. Correlation to such living factors ranged from 60 to 70 percent. In the families with asthmatics the Frequency_HP of cleaning was an important additional factor. This likely was a result of the strict instructions given by doctors to asthmatic patients. It was shown that the amount of guanine contained in house dust is an indicator of not only the number of mites but also of the amount of allergens contained in home dust.

[The time variations in pulmonary functional parameters in children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].28 children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, between 6 and 18 years old, were followed by a varied period of time - 3 months - 5 years. 7-8 functional tests were carried out. The cases were studied in different clinical phases: asymptomatic, manifest, crisis of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The functional pulmonary investigation included: spirographic examination [vital capacity (VC), maximum expiratory volume per second (MEVS) the VC/MEVS ratio], plethysmographic examination (VGT, Raw), measurement of the maximum instantaneous expiratory flows on the flux-volume curve (MEF50). The average value, standard residual deviation and the variation coefficient were calculated for each parameter studied in different clinical moments. The results are presented on 3 groups: per total, symptomatic and asymptomatic. The analysis of the data found showed that the variation of the parameters measured during repeated functional examinations in children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP ranges within broad limits (2.9%-11.5%); the broadest variation was recorded for Raw followed by MEF50 and the slightest variation was that of the VC/MEVS ratio. This indicated the lower value of the information furnished by this ratio in children, in appreciating the presence or severeness degree of the obstructive syndrome.

Alteration of salicylate binding to serum protein in allergic subjects.The binding of serum protein to salicylate was measured by a Sephadex batch method in the serum of 82 allergic individuals, 30 members of their families, and 24 normals. Subjects with the immediate types of Allergy_HP exhibited a significantly (p less than 0.001) increased binding ability corrected for albumin (Alb). The members of their families also showed significantly (p less than 0.005) elevated binding, but this was lower than in the allergic subjects themselves. The binding study with serum proteins fractionated with DEAE-Sephadex A-50 from both allergic and normal subjects using 14C-labeled salicylate showed that the salicylate molecule binds exclusively to Alb. No correlation was observed between the binding ability corrected for Alb and the serum Alb concentration in allergic and normal subjects. From the evidence obtained, there seems to be a certain underlying diathesis related to the Alb binding ability to endogenous inflammatory substances, which may back up the consequences of allergic reactions among allergic individuals.

[Investigations of volume and electrolyte concentrations in saliva of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP- and Epilepsy_ASDPTO-diseased children under therapy].To investigate if in children suffering from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP bronchiale or cerebral attacks and being under special long-term therapy changes in quantity and quality of saliva occure, both groups of probands were examined in comparision to corresponding controls. In both cases pharmaca were given which may influence the functions of vegetative neuralsystem. It was proved that children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP had a lower and those with attacks a higher volume of secretion in comparison with the controls. The calcium-concentrations proved to be higher in both treated groups, the magnesiumconcentration only in the anticonoulsive treated group. Plaqueextension, cariesincidence and index of periodontal inflammation was found to be slightly higher than in the controls.

Hepatitis_HP B virus infection among immunocompromised patients in Egypt.Several workers reported an increased susceptibility to Hepatitis_HP B virus (HBV) in immunosuppressed patients. A study was carried out on 4 groups of supposedly immunocompromised patients for Hepatitis_HP B surface antigen (HBsAg), and anti-HBs. The 4 groups of patients were suffering from: Leprosy, Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, Diabetes and hepatosplenic Schistosomiasis. Serum specimens were obtained from 137 patients representing the 4 groups and from a control group of 25 Healthy_HP individuals. All sera were tested by ELISA technique for HBsAg and anti-HBs. Results indicated that HBsAg carrier rate was 4% for the control Healthy_HP group, 7% for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, 10% for Diabetes, 24% for Leprosy and 28% for hepatosplenic Schistosomiasis. On the other hand, the anti-HBs was 21% for the control group, 29% for Schistosomiasis, 55% and 58% for Diabetes and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP respectively and 74% for Leprosy. This study shows that immunosuppressed patients particularly those suffering from leprosy and hepatosplenic Schistosomiasis experience higher HBsAg carrier rate than the control group for the endemic Hepatitis_HP B (6-7 times higher for leprosy and Schistosomiasis). An important observation was the diminished anti-HBs rate in hepatosplenic Schistosomiasis patients, despite the highest HBsAg carrier rate they exhibited. This may be due to an immunological defect, resulting in an unsatisfactory antibody response and Chronic_HP Hepatitis_HP B antigenemia. In Egypt, where Schistosomiasis is prevalent (40-50%), the problems caused by Hepatitis_HP B infection are increased.

Zinc and copper status in children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP.The study comprised 40 children of both sexes aged from 2 to 12 years, 22 suffering from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and 18 suffering from Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP. Twenty Healthy_HP children of comparable age and sex to the patients were studied as controls. All the children were subjected to full history including dietetic questionnaire, thorough examination, and to estimation of serum IgE, serum ceruloplasmin, and zinc and copper levels in both serum and hairs. The mean concentrations of zinc in serum and hairs were respectively 70.3 +/- 13.2 micrograms/100 ml and 167.5 +/- 23.0 micrograms/gm in Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic cases and 65.9 +/- 11.7 micrograms/100 ml and 164.8 +/- 23.6 micrograms/gm in those with Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP. These levels were significantly (p less than 0.001) decreased in comparison to the control values (88.4 +/- 11.0 micrograms/100 ml and 194.5 +/- 18.6 micrograms/gm). On the other hand, a significant (p less than 0.001) increase in serum and hairs copper was demonstrated in both allergic groups compared to the controls. Mean copper values were respectively 79.5 +/- 8.06 micrograms/100 ml and 18.7 +/- 1.9 micrograms/gm in the Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic cases and 81.4 +/- 8.4 micrograms/100 ml and 17.8 +/- 2.08 micrograms/gm in cases with Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP. The control mean concentrations were 67.95 +/- 6.37 micrograms/100 ml and 14.5 +/- 2.53 micrograms/gm respectively. Significant (p less than 0.001) higher levels of serum ceruloplasmin were observed in the allergic patients compared to the controls and were correlated with the Increased_circulating_copper_concentration_HP. The results were discussed and a good dietetic intake of high biological value protein and zinc supplement was recommended to these patients in order to correct their disturbances especially the hypozincemia which could lead to exaggeration of their allergic conditions. The field of trace elements metabolism has grown rapidly over the past few years, particularly after the development of novel techniques as the atomic absorption spectrophotometry which had allowed the reliable measurements of several trace elements in tissues and so had opened a new field for many researches (Henkin, 1976). Zinc and copper are involved in cell and tissue growth. Zinc plays an important role in DNA and protein synthesis and is intimately involved with copper as cofactors in several important enzyme systems. The effects of many pathological conditions as Congestive_heart_failure_HP, Pneumonia_HP, rheumatic heart diseases, Recurrent_HP_Bronchitis_HP infection, Hemolytic_Anemia_HP, Psoriasiform_dermatitis_HP, and Malnutrition_HP on the levels of serum zinc, copper, and other trace elements have been of interest to investigators for a number of years (Sinha and Gabrieli, 1970; David et al., 1984).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
Zinc and copper status in children with bronchial asthma and atopic dermatitis.The study comprised 40 children of both sexes aged from 2 to 12 years, 22 suffering from bronchial asthma and 18 suffering from atopic dermatitis. Twenty healthy children of comparable age and sex to the patients were studied as controls. All the children were subjected to full history including dietetic questionnaire, thorough examination, and to estimation of serum IgE, serum ceruloplasmin, and zinc and copper levels in both serum and hairs. The mean concentrations of zinc in serum and hairs were respectively 70.3 +/- 13.2 micrograms/100 ml and 167.5 +/- 23.0 micrograms/gm in asthmatic cases and 65.9 +/- 11.7 micrograms/100 ml and 164.8 +/- 23.6 micrograms/gm in those with atopic dermatitis.

Calcium channel blockers and terbutaline--a positive interaction.The role of two calcium channel blockers, nifedipine and verapamil was investigated in patients of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Both the drugs given orally produced an insignificant rise in PEFR, FEF25-75% and FEV1. Given along with terbutaline, however, these drugs produced significantly greater increase in PEFR, FEF25-75% and FEV1 as compared to patients receiving terbutaline alone. The two calcium channel blockers also inhibited the terbutaline induced Tremor_HP and palpitation.

Oxitropium bromide: an Acute_HP dose response study of a new anticholinergic drug in combination with fenoterol in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Chronic_Bronchitis_HP.The aim of this study was to compare the bronchodilator response of patients with either Stable_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP or Stable_HP Chronic_Bronchitis_HP to the Acute_HP administration of oxitropium bromide and a beta agonist (fenoterol) when given both separately and together in order to determine the responses of these two groups of patients and the optimal doses of these agents when given in combination. The responses of 23 patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and 25 patients with Chronic_Bronchitis_HP to 400 micrograms of fenoterol, and 200 micrograms of oxitropium given either alone or together with 100, 200 or 400 micrograms of fenoterol was studied. The peak bronchodilator response to oxitropium bromide of the patients with Chronic_Bronchitis_HP was equivalent to the fenoterol response while, in the patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, the response to oxitropium bromide was approximately 30% of the response to fenoterol. In both groups of subjects the addition of oxitropium bromide to fenoterol significantly increased both the magnitude and the duration of the bronchodilator response without a significant increase in side effects. In both groups of subjects 200 micrograms of oxitropium bromide and 200 micrograms or more of fenoterol gave the optimal response.

Effect of sensitization and aerosol antigen challenge in guinea-pigs--studies of airway receptor function and characteristics.Immunological sensitization of guinea-pigs and subsequent antigen inhalation challenge has provided an animal model which has several features in common with human Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Impairment of beta-adrenoceptor-mediated function and mechanisms have been postulated to contribute to the hyperreactivity to contractile agonists demonstrated in vivo and in vitro in these animals. Functional and receptor radioligand binding studies were carried out on airway tissue from: non-sensitized; sensitized; sensitized saline challenged; sensitized antigen challenged guinea-pigs. Sensitization did not alter responsiveness of airway tissue to carbachol, although subsequent antigen challenge did increase carbachol sensitivity of Peripheral_HP airway tissue six-fold. Neither sensitization itself nor subsequent antigen challenge altered binding characteristics of the muscarinic cholinoceptor ligand [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) to Peripheral_HP airway tissue, suggesting that mechanisms responsible for increases in carbachol sensitivity are Distal_HP to these receptors. Relaxation of airway preparations to isoprenaline was not altered by sensitization or further antigen challenge of the animals. However, sensitization significantly reduced affinity but not the total number of binding sites in Peripheral_HP airway tissue for the beta-adrenoceptor ligand [3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA). Antigen challenge of the animals did not further alter beta-adrenoceptor ligand binding characteristics. These results suggest that airway hyperreactivity in this model is not a function of alteration in receptor characteristics, or impairment of relaxation mechanisms.

Sensitization did not alter responsiveness of airway tissue to carbachol, although subsequent antigen challenge did increase carbachol sensitivity of peripheral airway tissue six-fold. Neither sensitization itself nor subsequent antigen challenge altered binding characteristics of the muscarinic cholinoceptor ligand [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) to peripheral airway tissue, suggesting that mechanisms responsible for increases in carbachol sensitivity are distal to these receptors. Relaxation of airway preparations to isoprenaline was not altered by sensitization or further antigen challenge of the animals. However, sensitization significantly reduced affinity but not the total number of binding sites in peripheral airway tissue for the beta-adrenoceptor ligand [3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA). Antigen challenge of the animals did not further alter beta-adrenoceptor ligand binding characteristics. These results suggest that airway hyperreactivity in this model is not a function of alteration in receptor characteristics, or impairment of relaxation mechanisms.
Relative efficacy of nebulised ipratropium bromide and fenoterol in Status_asthmaticus_HP.In a double-blind, randomised, controlled clinical trial of 145 patients with Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, the efficacy of nebulised 4-hourly ipratropium bromide plus 4-hourly fenoterol (group I, 50 patients), 2-hourly fenoterol (group II, 50 patients) and 4-hourly fenoterol (group III, 45 patients) was assessed. All patients received an optimal infusion of aminophylline and 81 patients (27 in each group) received hydrocortisone for clinical indications. It was found that cholinergic side-effects in group I were not more common than in group II. Tremor_HP was more common in group II. Assessment of bronchodilator efficacy was confined to the 81 patients whose therapy included hydrocortisone. Peak expiratory flow rate, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and forced vital capacity were expressed as a percentage of predicted for each individual and the mean values for each group plotted. It was found that the response rate, as assessed by the area under the curve, was significantly more rapid in group I compared with both group II (P less than 0.001) and group III (P less than 0.005). These findings were consistent for all three lung function measurements. However, there was no significant difference in the responses between group II and group III. It is concluded that adding ipratropium bromide to conventional regimens is likely to benefit patients with Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Airways responses to ipratropium bromide do not vary with time in asthmatic subjects. Studies of interindividual and intraindividual variation of bronchodilatation and protection against histamine-induced bronchoconstriction.Bronchial histamine provocation tests were performed in nine patients with nonallergic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP on four consecutive days 45 minutes after inhalation of placebo or ipratropium bromide in a dose-response manner (40 micrograms, 200 micrograms, and 800 micrograms). The drugs were administered double-blind, one dose on each day. This procedure was repeated identically after three to nine months to investigate whether the bronchial responses to ipratropium bromide are constant or change with time. Ipratropium bromide induced a significantly better bronchodilation and protection against histamine-induced bronchoconstriction than placebo with no differences between the three doses. No correlation between bronchodilatation and protection was found. In six asthmatic patients ("responders") ipratropium bromide induced a significant protective effect against histamine-induced bronchoconstriction but no dose-response relationship was found. In three patients none or a very poor protective effect was found at all dose levels ("nonresponders"). The protective effect of ipratropium bromide against histamine-induced bronchoconstriction did not differ between the first and second occasion. Thus, the bronchoprotection differed between different asthmatic subjects but did not vary with time (three to nine months) within the same subject. This finding seems to be of clinical importance since it implicates that the effect of anticholinergic agents on the airways is predictable.

Nebulized ipratropium in the treatment of Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The efficacy of ipratropium and salbutamol was determined in 117 patients with Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP who presented to an emergency department to determine whether the order of administration of the two agents affects the improvement in peak flow rates. Patients were given two nebulized treatments at an interval of one hour in a randomized, double-blind design. They received either 5 mg nebulized salbutamol followed by 0.5 mg ipratropium, ipratropium followed by salbutamol, or both drugs administered together followed by nebulized saline. Ipratropium was an effective bronchodilator when given as the first agent. Simultaneous administration with salbutamol was as effective as sequential administration. At one hour after treatment, there was no difference in peak flow between the combination of drugs and either drug given alone. Ipratropium given after salbutamol was not superior to saline solution given after the combination of drugs. Our data do not suggest a substantial therapeutic effect from addition of ipratropium to salbutamol in the immediate treatment of Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Efficacy and duration of action of oral procaterol in asthmatic children after single administration of different dosages.A double-blind crossover study was performed to evaluate the bronchodilating effect of different single doses of procaterol (less than 0.5 micrograms/kg, 1.5 micrograms/kg, and placebo) orally administered. Sixteen asthmatic children, age 6-12 years, participated in the trial. Pulmonary function, heart rate, blood pressure, and Tremor_HP were evaluated at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min and then hourly for 8 hours after administration. All three doses were therapeutically effective. The 1.5 micrograms/kg dose produced a more sustained bronchodilatation effect, but was also associated with an increase in the incidence of Tremor_HPs. The 0.5 micrograms/kg dosage may, however, be a good starting dose because it assures a reasonable risk/benefit ratio.

A clinical and immunologic study of colchicine in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.A double-blind, randomized, crossover Chronic_HP study was done to determine the efficacy of colchicine in 10 atopic patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. A constant dose of sustained-release theophylline and albuterol by inhalation, as needed, was administered. Compared to placebo, colchicine, 0.5 mg twice daily, significantly reduced the mean (+/- SEM) daily clinical score from 2.18 +/- 0.34 to 1.64 +/- 0.32 (p less than 0.05), and the daily number of inhalations of albuterol from 5.89 +/- 1.48 to 4.01 +/- 1.26 (p less than 0.02). Colchicine significantly (p less than 0.05) increased the concanavalin A-induced suppressor cell function from 16.2 +/- 4.6% to 39.0 +/- 10.7%, which was similar to Healthy_HP volunteers (41.1 +/- 3.5%). Furthermore, colchicine significantly (p less than 0.05) decreased serum IgE from 248 +/- 63 to 188 +/- 46 IU/ml. Colchicine had no significant effect on pulmonary function tests, the early phase reaction of antigen-induced bronchial inhalation challenge, and immediate skin test responses. Thus, colchicine has immunomodulatory effects that may perhaps have a Mild_HP benefit in the treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

[Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in a hairdresser caused by hair bleach].Three years after starting to work as a hairdresser a 33-year-old woman developed Urticaria_HP on contact with hairbleach. After a further four years rhinoconjunctivitis set in and later also bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP on contact with such bleaches. Extensive tests revealed hypersensitivity to widely used persulphate-containing bleaching liquids which ultimately forced the patient to give up her profession. The causative role of this group of chemicals was proven by positive skin tests and specific workplace-related provocation tests. But specific IgE antibodies could not be demonstrated. The findings suggest a pseudoallergic reaction.

Effect of terfenadine and ipratropium bromide on ultrasonically nebulized distilled water-induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Inhalation of ultrasonically nebulized distilled water was used to evaluate non-specific bronchial reactivity and to investigate nonimmunologically mediated Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Release of histamine and other mediators from mast cells and stimulation of lung irritant receptors are mechanisms that may be involved in nebulized distilled water-induced bronchoconstriction. To investigate the contribution of these mechanisms the effect of terfenadine and ipratropium bromide on the bronchial response to this stimulus was assessed. A total of 30 asthmatics (mean 28.7 years) were submitted on three different days to distilled water challenge with or without prior treatment with oral terfenadine or inhaled aerosolized ipratropium bromide. The decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 s induced by the same dose of distilled water was significantly (P less than 0.001) reduced from 35.6 +/- 15.8% to 19.5 +/- 16% with terfenadine and to 23.9 +/- 19.7% with ipratropium bromide. The results suggest that histamine release and reflex bronchoconstriction are mechanisms involved in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP induced by ultrasonically nebulized distilled water.

[The effect of verapamil on external respiratory function in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP patients during high-altitude speleotherapy].To study the effect of speleotherapy on external respiration (ER) in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, ER was investigated in 2 randomized groups of 20 Asthma_ASDPTO_HP subjects each. Speleotherapy was conducted in 24-day courses in salt caves of Chon-Tuz (2100 m above the sea level). The overall exposure lasted 160 hrs. One of the groups was assigned to additional verapamil hydrochloride aerosol therapy (10 mg/day, days 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22). Speleotherapy was found to initiate positive shifts in the external respiration function whereas verapamil hydrochloride to potentiate the observed beneficial rearrangement in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP patients.

Effective therapy of glucocorticoid-induced Osteoporosis_HP with medroxyprogesterone acetate.The effect of long-acting medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) on the trabecular bone density in patients with glucocorticoid-induced Osteoporosis_HP (GCO) was evaluated. Thirteen steroid-dependent asthmatic male patients with GCO were administered 200 mg MPA intramuscularly at 6-week intervals and 1 g of elemental calcium daily for a period of 1 year. Ten additional matched steroid-dependent asthmatic male patients received 1 g of elemental calcium daily (controls). All 23 patients involved in the study had vertebral trabecular bone densitometry (TBD) by quantitative computed tomography (QCT) at baseline and at 6 and 12 months into the study. A 17% increase in TBD was found in the MPA-treated patients at 1 year (from 68.5 +/- 5 to 80.2 +/- 4 mg K2HPO4/cc) in contrast to the control group who experienced a 21% decrease in TBD during the same period of time (from 80.5 +/- 7 to 63.7 +/- 8 mg K2HPO4/cc) (T = 6.90, P = 0.0001 df = 21). There were no significant changes in other parameters followed during the study in the MPA-treated group (serum calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, PTH, alkaline phosphatase, triglycerides, total and HDL cholesterol, urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, creatinine) except for a decrease in the serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone (P less than 0.01) as well as of the hydroxyproline-creatinine ratio (P less than 0.01). The results lend support to the hypothesis of a progesterone-glucocorticoid competitive antagonism at the bone level, though other possibilities can be entertained, and suggest MPA as an effective therapy for glucocorticoid-induced Osteoporosis_HP in men.

[Anti-CD45R antibody-treated normal lymphocytes respond to interleukin 2 (IL2) after stimulation by allergens].Interleukin 2 (IL2) responsiveness was specifically induced by Dermatophagoides farinae (Df) antigen in Df-sensitized lymphocytes from asthmatic children, but not in normal lymphocytes. Df-induced IL2 responsiveness was also observed in normal lymphocytes pretreated (Day 0) with anti-CD45R antibody, which recognize suppressor inducer subset among CD4+ T cells. However anti-CD45R antibody was no longer effective when the lymphocytes were cultured for more than one day with the antigen, suggesting its effect in the initial phase of the reaction. The Severity_HP of the response induced in normal lymphocytes by the anti-CD45R was comparable to that of the patients sensitized to the nominal antigen. The response of the patients was no longer augmented by the anti-CD45R antibody. Taken together, these data suggest that even normal lymphocytes have potentiality to elicit Df-induced IL2 responsiveness and it is probably derepressed by inhibiting suppressor inducer subset with the anti-CD45R antibody. Also suggested is a defective suppressor inducer activity in the lymphocytes which may lead to hyperreactivity to allergens in asthmatic children.

[Effects of ipratropium bromide and salbutamol on isolated lung hyperinflation in symptom-free intervals in asthmatic children].To evaluate the effects of salbutamol and ipratropium bromide on the isolated hyperinflation, without Central_HP airways obstruction, during asymptomatic periods in asthmatic children, 31 children, out of ca. 500, were selected for a double-blind therapy trial, according to the following criteria: Thoracic gas volume greater than 140% predicted (mean +/- 1SD: 162 +/- 16%) and/or trapped-gas greater than 15% (21 +/- 5%); airways resistance less than 140% (105 +/- 25%) and forced expiratory volume in one second greater than 75% (91 +/- 11%). On 4 consecutive mornings spirometry, bodyplethesmography and measurement of functional residual capacity by helium-dilution were performed before and 20' after inhalation of 2 ml of each of 4 solutions respectively. The children received the solution which produced the largest fall of thoracic gas volume and/or trapped-gas, 4 times/day for 4-5 weeks: 1. five children received saline; 2. 13 salbutamol, 2.5 mg; 3. 6 ipratropium, 0.250 mg; 4. 7 both drugs. Clinical aspects and lung function differed not significantly between the 4 groups. Lung function values showed no correlations with duration, clinical Severity_HP and typ of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. At the beginning and after 4-5 weeks of treatment lung function improved significantly in the groups 2-4, compared with pretreatment values. At study end, the improvements of thoracic gas volume, trapped-gas and airways resistance differed significantly between the groups, salbutamol + ipratropium produced altogether the best effect. With time, the effect of salbutamol + ipratropium on thoracic gas volume and trapped-gas increased and that of salbutamol on airways resistance and forced expiratory volume in one second decreased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is not associated with auto-antibodies to lipocortin-1.Corticosteroids may mediate some of their anti-inflammatory action by the induction of lipocortin-1, which inhibits phospholipase A2 activity. Raised levels of antibodies to lipocortin have been found in patients with Rheumatoid_Arthritis_HP (RA) and Systemic_lupus_erythematosus_HP (Systemic_lupus_erythematosus_HP) and it has been postulated that these may contribute to steroid resistance. A proportion of Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients fail to respond to treatment with corticosteroids and one possible mechanism is that these patients have raised levels of anti-lipocortin antibodies. We have therefore measured IgG and IgM antibodies to lipocortin by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in eight corticosteroid-sensitive (CS) and 7 corticosteroid-resistant (CR) Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic subjects, and in eight normal controls. Comparison of Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic subjects with normal controls revealed no significant differences in either IgG or IgM antibodies to lipocortin. Comparison of CS Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic subjects with CR Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic subjects similarly revealed no significant differences in the concentration of either IgG or IgM antibodies to lipocortin. Levels of anti-lipocortin antibodies did not correlate with clinical response to treatment with 40 mg/day of prednisolone. Anti-lipocortin antibodies are unlikely to be involved in the inflammation seen in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, or in the relative insensitivity to corticosteroids seen in CR Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic subjects.

Levels of anti-lipocortin antibodies did not correlate with clinical response to treatment with 40 mg/day of prednisolone. Anti-lipocortin antibodies are unlikely to be involved in the inflammation seen in asthma, or in the relative insensitivity to corticosteroids seen in CR asthmatic subjects.
Bronchial asthma is not associated with auto-antibodies to lipocortin-1.Corticosteroids may mediate some of their anti-inflammatory action by the induction of lipocortin-1, which inhibits phospholipase A2 activity. Raised levels of antibodies to lipocortin have been found in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and it has been postulated that these may contribute to steroid resistance. A proportion of asthmatic patients fail to respond to treatment with corticosteroids and one possible mechanism is that these patients have raised levels of anti-lipocortin antibodies. We have therefore measured IgG and IgM antibodies to lipocortin by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in eight corticosteroid-sensitive (CS) and 7 corticosteroid-resistant (CR) asthmatic subjects, and in eight normal controls. Comparison of asthmatic subjects with normal controls revealed no significant differences in either IgG or IgM antibodies to lipocortin. Comparison of CS asthmatic subjects with CR asthmatic subjects similarly revealed no significant differences in the concentration of either IgG or IgM antibodies to lipocortin. Levels of anti-lipocortin antibodies did not correlate with clinical response to treatment with 40 mg/day of prednisolone. Anti-lipocortin antibodies are unlikely to be involved in the inflammation seen in asthma, or in the relative insensitivity to corticosteroids seen in CR asthmatic subjects.
[Effect of the platelet-activating factor antagonist BN 52063 on exertional Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].In a randomised single-blind crossover study we assessed the effects of a specific PAF acether antagonist, BN 52063, on the early asthmatic response to exercise in six patients with exercise induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. After a treatment period of two days an exercise challenge on the third day was preceded by administration of either placebo or BN 52063 240 mg p.o. 3 hours or 5 mg by inhalation 30 minutes before the challenge. After the oral intake of 240 mg BN 52063 there was no effect on the initial exercise induced bronchoconstriction, but the Prolonged_HP reduction of PEF was significantly attenuated expressed as a smaller AUC (p less than 0.02). In the placebo period there was a marked increase in plasma concentrations of both platelet factor 4 (PF4) and beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TBG). Intake of BN 52063 diminished the rise in plasma concentrations of PF4 and beta-TBG after the exercise challenge significantly. The results show that platelet activation after exercise induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was markedly inhibited by BN 52063, indicating that PAF acts as a mediator in exercise induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

[Reproducibility of the bronchospasmolytic effect of anticholinergic drugs and beta-sympathomimetics].The bronchodilator effect of an anticholinergic and beta-adrenergic drug in the same patient was tested at 3 different times to study the reproducibility. There is a good average reproducibility: the curves concerning the bronchodilation are nearly identical or parallel. On the other hand there is a greater difference in the individual curves at different times: the patients with the most Severe_HP airway obstruction show the greatest difference in the bronchodilator effect at different times.

[The potentials of a unified polyclinic-hospital system in raising the quality of the Diagnosis_ASDPTO and the efficacy of the differentiated therapy of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP patients].The authors review potential approaches to the upgrading of the Diagnosis_ASDPTO at the out- and inpatient stages of the rendering medical assistance to patients suffering from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (BA). Show the necessity of the counselling specialized aid, additional studies of the signs of atopy, wise combination of non- and medicamentous treatment methods to enhance the efficacy of the treatment of BA patients. Provide evidence for the advisability of solving the organizational problems concerned with a closer interaction of the polyclinic and hospital with the leading medical institutions on the problem "Pathology of the Respiratory Organs".

[Serum IgE and Fc epsilon receptor positive lymphocytes in Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP--relation to the background of respiratory atopy].The serum IgE level and the population of Fc epsilon R2+ lymphocytes in Peripheral_HP blood of 62 patients with Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP (AD) were studied. IgE was increased in the majority of the patients with personal or Family_history_HP of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and/or Allergic_Rhinitis_HP (combined AD). On the contrary, only 63.2% of the patients who have solely AD (pure AD) showed less elevation of IgE. There was no correlation between IgE and the Severity_HP of Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP in pure AD and Rhinitis_HP combined AD. However, Asthma_ASDPTO_HP combined AD showed a significant positive correlation between IgE and the Severity_HP of Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP. In AD, the population of Fc epsilon R2+ lymphocytes significantly correlated with IgE, suggesting that Fc epsilon R2+ lymphocytes may play a role in the enhanced synthesis of IgE. However, the increase of Fc epsilon R2+ lymphocytes was found only in combined AD, but not in pure AD. These results suggest that elevated IgE and Fc epsilon R2+ lymphocytes reflect combined respiratory atopy rather than AD itself, although there remains the possibility that IgE may influence the formation or exacerbation of Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP combined AD. As far as the participation of IgE is concerned, pure AD and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP combined AD could be different groups and should be investigated separately.

Severe_HP exacerbations of Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Incremental benefit of adding ipratropium to usual therapy.Single dose studies have assessed the utility of ipratropium bromide alone or with beta agonists in the short- and long-term management of Chronic_HP Obstructive_lung_disease_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. We performed a randomized, double-blind trial to assess the incremental benefit over 24 hours of adding ipratropium vs placebo to a standardized regimen of Medications_ASDPTO commonly used in the Acute_HP and subsequent hospital management of Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Sixty-eight subjects received nebulized salbutamol, intravenous methylprednisolone, intravenous aminophylline, and antibiotics and were randomized to receive either 80 micrograms of ipratropium or placebo via metered dose inhaler and spacing device with each salbutamol treatment (6 to 8 times per day). Among the 50 patients who completed the study, there were no significant differences between ipratropium and placebo groups with respect to baseline FEV1, FVC, and PaCO2. The improvement of FEV1 from baseline to 24 hours was 294 (SD = 568) ml in the ipratropium group vs 393 (SD = 622) ml in placebo group. Adjusting FEV1 by age, gender, and Smoking_ASDPTO did not significantly alter the findings. Those with an admission Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP showed larger 24 hour FEV1 responses (487 ml in ipratropium vs 801 ml in placebo) than those with Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP (149 ml ipratropium vs 102 ml in placebo). However, within these two strata, there were no significant differences in FEV1 improvement between ipratropium and placebo groups. This study suggests that if ipratropium is used in the initial emergency treatment of Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP or Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, it could safely be discontinued by 24 hours in order to reduce the cost and complexity of therapy.
Severe_HP exacerbations of COPD and asthma. Incremental benefit of adding ipratropium to usual therapy.Single dose studies have assessed the utility of ipratropium bromide alone or with beta agonists in the short- and long-term management of chronic obstructive lung disease and asthma.

Mortality and disability among cotton mill workers.The mortality and disability of cotton mill workers were studied in five Finnish cotton mills. The population under study comprised all 1065 women exposed to raw cotton dust who had been hired between 1950 and 1971. The minimum exposure period was five years. For the study on disability, the cohort was followed up until the end of 1981. The follow up period for the mortality analysis was from 1950 to 1985. At the end of 1981 the observed number of prevalent disability pensions for respiratory disease was 15, whereas 3.9 were expected (p less than 0.01) on the basis of the national figures for women. There were 46 musculoskeletal diseases (27.7 expected, p less than 0.01), of which 24 were OsteoArthritis_HP (14.5 expected) and 13 Rheumatoid_Arthritis_HP (6.6 expected). The incidence rates of disability pensions were calculated for the period 1969-81. Comparison of incidence rates between cotton mill workers and the Finnish female population showed excessive rates for both respiratory diseases (p less than 0.001) and musculoskeletal diseases (p less than 0.01), with an excess of new cases of Rheumatoid_Arthritis_HP (p less than 0.05). By the end of 1985 the number of person-years was 31,678 and the number of deaths 95. The standardised mortality ratios for the total period of follow up (1950-85) showed no excess for respiratory diseases. Mortality from Cardiovascular_Diseases_ASDPTO was also lower than expected. The observed number of tumours was 33, the corresponding expected number 32.0. Thirteen tumours were in the digestive organs (6.6 expected, p<0.05) and three were lung cancers (1.9 expected). Five workers had died from renal disease; the expected number was 1.5 (p<0.05).

The role of anticholinergic bronchodilators in adult Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP.Our renewed interest in anticholinergic bronchodilator therapy has been sparked by the development of safe yet effective quaternary anticholinergic compounds including ipratropium bromide, oxitropium and atropine methonitrate. These agents offer gradual and sustained bronchodilation to patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and to patients with Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP. However, their role in the maintenance treatment of these two diseases differs significantly. In Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, the anticholinergic drugs have useful additive properties when used with adrenergic drugs or theophylline. They may be a particularly useful component of combination regimens in patients with disease of more than Mild_HP Severity_HP and in older patients. The combination of inhaled adrenergic and anticholinergic drugs is also useful in the Acute_HP setting for Acute_HP exacerbations of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. In Chronic_HP Obstructive_lung_disease_HP, the anticholinergic compounds offer greater bronchodilatation than adrenergic drugs for the majority of patients. Thus, the inhaled anticholinergic drugs may be considered as useful initial choices in the Chronic_HP maintenance therapy of Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP.

The role of anticholinergic antimuscarinic bronchodilator therapy in children.In the intricate system of control of airway caliber, the cholinergic (muscarinic) sympathetic nervous system has an important role. Despite the paucity of physiologic or clinical data, it is clear that anticholinergic, antimuscarinic bronchodilator therapy is useful in the management of childhood airway disease. Ipratropium bromide is the only safe and adequately studied agent. It is effective in conjunction with beta-agonists in Acute_HP Severe_HP childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and has an important role in the management of wheezy infants and in Chronic_HP_lung_disease_HP of prematurity (bronchopulmonary dysplasia).

Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and the employment experience.Previous Asthma_ASDPTO_HP research has had a medical focus, and only one study has investigated the relationship between Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and employment. This study describes the employment experience in relation to occupational choice and career advancement in 93 sequentially selected adult asthmatics attending a hospital based Asthma_ASDPTO_HP clinic serving a socially disadvantaged urban population. Repeated hospital admissions and Frequent_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP related sick leave from work were identified as contributing factors to employer discrimination, job dismissal, and lack of career advancement. Seventy-seven percent had not informed their employers of their Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and 32% of those currently employed stated that getting time off work was a problem in relation to Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Clinic attendance. Of those not employed, 22.9% were receiving sickness or invalid benefits and 8.3% had lost their jobs because of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. This study illustrates how the stigma attached to the Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in this community may not only impact negatively on employment opportunity, but also on Asthma_ASDPTO_HP care.

Questionnaire to measure perceived symptoms and disability in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.A questionnaire was designed for completion by parents of asthmatic children aged from 5-14 years that provides scales of good content validity and internal reliability for the measurement of perceived disability, perceived Nocturnal_HP symptoms, and perceived daytime symptoms. We hope that this questionnaire will be included in future clinical studies of these patients.

Comparison of inhaled terbutaline and inhaled terbutaline plus ipratropium bromide in Acute_HP asthmatic children.Twenty asthmatic children, aged 4 to 15 years, consisting of 14 boys and 6 girls, were studied during Acute_HP episodes of asthmatic attacks. A group of 10 children each received either inhaled terbutaline 0.5 mg or inhaled terbutaline 0.5 mg followed by ipratropium bromide 0.04 mg 15 minutes later through a 750-ml volumetric spacer. Significant increases in FEV1 over the baseline were observed from 2 minutes to 2 hours and from 2 minutes to 6 hours following the first and second regimen respectively. A slightly greater increase and longer duration in FEV1 were observed in the combined drug treatment and very slight decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure below the base-line were observed. Neither regimen showed any serious adverse effect on the heart rate and respiratory rate.

[Medico-legal statistics on occupational asthmna in Quebec between 1986 and 1988].The authors have carried out a statistical analysis of cases of occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and other occupational Abnormal_lung_morphology_HPs submitted to the Ministry of Labour in Quebec between 1986 and 1988. The total number of claims was 913, 993, and 866 respectively for the 3 years of which 61% to 71% were accepted. 41% to 55% were new assessments. Of 228 new claims accepted in 1988, 81 (36%) were for occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. This number surpassed the number of claims accepted for traditional pneumoconiosis (asbestos = 30, and silicose = 36). Isocyanates were the principle cause of occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (23% of cases were recognised in 1988) followed by flour, red and white cedar, snow crab process workers, and various pharmaceutical products and grains. In comparison with statistics in 1977, one noticed there was a large reversal of the Frequency_HP of certain occupational Abnormal_lung_morphology_HPs that are recognised, because at that time asbestosis and silicosis were the principle causes of claims put forward and accepted. The authors discuss the statistical bias of occupational Abnormal_lung_morphology_HP obtained by medico-legal agencies. Although occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP has not been the object of the systematic screening program in the work place and although there is a tendency for workers to avoid or abandon their occupation more often than in the traditional pneumoconioses current protection is sufficient in Quebec to motivate individuals who are possibly suffering from occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP to put in a claim for compensation.

Transient_HP neuromuscular impairment resulting from Prolonged_HP inhalation of halothane and enflurane.Inhalation anesthesia first with halothane followed by enflurane relieved a patient with Status_asthmaticus_HP who was Refractory_HP to conventional therapy including mechanical ventilation. After 13 days of anesthesia while on mechanical ventilation and employing nondepolarizing muscle relaxants, significant neuromuscular impairment, manifested by Tetraplegia_HP and sensory disturbance, developed. Anesthesia was discontinued on day 14, and the patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation on day 16. Over the next two months, the neuromuscular impairment markedly improved. Halothane was associated with Arrhythmia_HP and Hepatitis_HP necessitating replacement by enflurane. Enflurane appeared to be as effective a treatment for Refractory_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP as halothane. The most probable cause of the neuromuscular impairment in our patient was the long-term use of inhalation anesthetics or nondepolarizing muscle relaxants.

Peak flow meters: are they monitoring tools or training devices?Previous studies have been inconclusive as to whether peak flow meter use teaches Asthma_ASDPTO_HP patients to better perceive their own pulmonary functioning. This investigation utilized a delayed baseline design to determine if pulmonary awareness could be improved among a sample of 24 adult patients who compared daily peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP symptom ratings. Results indicated that among this sample of adult patients: (i) perception of pulmonary functioning was poor, (ii) adherence to peak flow meter use was poor, and (iii) among patients who use peak flow meters daily, self-perception of pulmonary functioning did not improve significantly. Summary tables and descriptive statistics for pulmonary functioning are provided, and treatment implications are discussed.

Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is a potent bronchodilator in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The bronchodilating effects of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) were compared to effects of salbutamol in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in eight subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and with airflow limitation. ANF was infused intravenously (0.1 microgram/kg/min during 30 minutes) and caused a short-lasting significant (p less than 0.012) bronchodilation in all patients similar in Severity_HP to intravenous salbutamol (0.13 microgram/kg/min). The duration of the effect of the beta 2-agonist, however, was longer. No Severe_HP side effects were noted with ANF infusion. ANF may play a role in the modulation of the bronchial tone in humans, but its usefulness in the treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP remains to be determined.

[Effect of high-altitude climate therapy on the adrenal cortex function in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].132 Asthma_ASDPTO_HP patients living in Frunze (760 m above the sea level) and those on adaptation days 3-5 and 25-30 to the climate of North Tien Shan (3200 m above the sea level) underwent clinical and functional examination involving assessment of ACTH, cortisol and aldosterone levels. The patients showed clinical response and improvement of bronchial permeability associated with a pronounced growth of plasma cortisol levels starting on adaptation days 3-5. By adaptation days 25-30 cortisol levels were still on the increase while ACTH concentration tended to reduction.

Bronchoconstriction induced by spirometric maneuvers in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.We analyzed forced expiration maneuver-induced bronchoconstriction in 14 Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients and in seven normal subjects by breaking down the forced expiration maneuver of spirometry (the FVC maneuver) into two phases: a slow, deep inspiration to the total lung capacity (TLC) (the DI maneuver) and a forced expiration to the residual volume (RV) (the PFV maneuver). Specific airway conductance (sGaw) was measured at functional residual capacity (FRC) after each of the three maneuvers. All of the maneuvers caused the greatest bronchoconstriction immediately after completion of the maneuver. The mean decreases in the sGaw immediately after the FVC, DI, and PFV maneuvers were 45.0 +/- 6.6 (SD)% (P less than .001), 29.6 +/- 5.3% (P less than .001), and 16.7 +/- 5.3% (P less than .03), respectively. The decrease in sGaw by the FVC maneuver was very close to the combined algebraic sum of the DI maneuver and the PFV maneuver. The normal subjects did not show any changes in the sGaw by any of the maneuvers. The inhalation of albuterol almost abolished the response of bronchoconstriction to any of the three maneuvers, but inhalation of an anticholinergic agent, ipratropium bromide, did blunt the response. This study suggests that forced expiration maneuver-induced bronchoconstriction in Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics can be caused not only by deep inspiration to the TLC but also by forced expiration to the RV, and that the bronchoconstriction may be brought about mainly by an increase in parasympathetic activity.

[Clinical study on the inhibitory effect of AA-2414 on platelet function in asthmatic patients].We studied the effect of AA-2414, a TXA2 receptor antagonist, on platelet function in 12 asthmatic patients, 6 males and 6 females, whose mean age was 43.6 years. AA-2414 was orally administered to each patient at 20 mg/day for two weeks and then at 40 mg/day for the following two weeks. Platelet aggregation, plasma concentration of TXB2, and serum concentrations of AA-2414 and its metabolites were measured before and after the administration of each dose. Platelet aggregation induced by U-46619 (an analogue of PGH2), STA2 (a Stable_HP analogue of TXA2) and arachidonic acid with the administration of AA-2414 was significantly inhibited. The degree of this inhibition was proportional to the serum level of the drug. Plasma concentration of TXA2 tended to be lowered by administration of AA-2414, but it was not statistically significant. Eight (75.0%) of the 12 patients showed clinical improvement. In the cases where the drug was ineffective, the inhibition of platelet aggregation after administration of AA-2414 was less than in those cases where it was effective. We conclude that AA-2414 might exert its antiplatelet and antiasthmatic effects through antagonism of the TXA2 receptor. Investigation of the response to AA-2414 may be useful in assessing the clinical effect of this compound.

In vitro tests for the Diagnosis_ASDPTO of aspirin-sensitive Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.In patients with aspirin-sensitive Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, no significant changes in plasma beta-thromboglobulin or bicyclic prostaglandin (PG) E2 were observed during aspirin challenge. The addition of aspirin to platelet suspensions from patients with aspirin-sensitive Asthma_ASDPTO_HP produced no detectable chemiluminescence. Small concentrations of aspirin generated PGF2 alpha but not PGE2 or PGD2 from plasma in vitro. PGF2 alpha levels were significantly higher in plasma from aspirin-sensitive patients and distinguished aspirin-sensitive from aspirin-tolerant patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The results of this study suggest that the displacement of protein-bound PGF2 alpha may be of importance in the pathogenesis of aspirin-induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

[Bronchial tolerance to inhalation of beclomethasone. Histologic and microbiologic study in asthmatic patients].The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of a three months' treatment with beclomethasone dipropionate on the bronchial mucosa of asthmatic patients. Eleven patients suffering from a Mild_HP Chronic_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP treated with inhaled salbutamol and theophylline were randomly assigned to receive either 1000 mu g of beclomethasone dipropionate (6 patients) or an aerosolized placebo (5 patients) in a double-blind manner. Bronchial biopsies and bronchial secretions were obtained through a fiberoptic procedure at the beginning and the end of the study. Repeated clinical and spirometric investigations were performed each month. Inter- and intra-group mean changes of clinical symptoms and of spirometric values were not significantly different. Pathogens were rarely found in bronchial aspirates and their occurrence did not seem to be influenced by the beclomethasone therapy. Sixty percent of the bronchial biopsies displayed pathological changes of the mucosa that observed at the beginning and at the end of the study; however, no sign of mucosal atrophy was noted.

Bronchodilator responses to salbutamol followed by ipratropium bromide in partially reversible airflow obstruction.We have performed a retrospective survey on 296 patients, who attended the Respiratory Function Unit at Guy's Hospital to have their bronchodilator responses (BR) tested. The aim of the study was to see the effect of ipratropium bromide (IB) in a group of patients with incomplete reversibility after salbutamol (S). Patients were routinely given salbutamol and ipratropium bromide sequentially by inhalation, and spirometric changes were recorded after each drug. We identified two groups: Group A, 95 patients with FEV1 response greater than or equal to 0.2 l after either drug and FEV1 less than 80% predicted after salbutamol; and, Group B, 49 with change in FEV1 less than 0.02 l, FVC less than 80% predicted after salbutamol and an improvement in FVC greater than or equal to 0.33 l. Seventy-nine of the 95 patients in Group A also had an FVC response. In Group A, age was negatively correlated with response to salbutamol (r = -0.41, P less than 0.0001), and within Group B baseline FVC was negatively correlated with response to ipratropium bromide (r = -0.30, P = 0.03). There were no differences in age, sex, or doses given to each group (median dose: salbutamol, 800 micrograms, ipratropium bromide 120 micrograms). Baseline FEV1 and FVC (% predicted) were significantly higher in FEV1 responders. Mean (SD) FEV1 were 43% (14) in Group A vs. 29% (14) in Group B, while FVC were 62% (16) vs. 47% (13), P less than 0.001. Responses to ipratropium bromide were more Frequent_HP in Group B; in Group A 87% improved after salbutamol and 26% after ipratropium bromide, while in Group B 68% responded to salbutamol and 47% to ipratropium bromide (P = 0.03). Most patients responded to salbutamol, but in 33% ipratropium bromide had an additional effect. The FEV1 response to salbutamol declined with age. Isolated volume responders had more Severe_HP airflow obstruction, had less responses to salbutamol and were more likely to show a response to ipratropium bromide. These results support a trial of ipratropium bromide in patients with inadequate beta responsiveness, especially in those with Severe_HP airflow obstruction.

Comparison of the effect of loratadine on the airway and skin responses to histamine, methacholine, and allergen in subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Loratadine is a highly selective, long-acting, H1-receptor antagonist. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study, we evaluated the effects of loratadine, 10 and 20 mg, and placebo administered once daily for 3 days on the skin-wheal responses to histamine, the airway responses to inhaled histamine and methacholine, and the skin-wheal and airway responses to allergen in 12 subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. There was no evidence of a bronchodilator action 3 hours after a third oral dose. In the airways, the geometric mean of the provocative concentration of histamine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 after placebo or loratadine, 10 and 20 mg, was 0.68 mg/ml, 2.71 mg/ml (p, not significant), and 5.96 mg/ml (p less than 0.05), respectively. The concentration ratios (value after active treatment/value after placebo) for loratadine, 10 and 20 mg, were 5.1 (p less than 0.05) and 13.4 (p less than 0.05). Neither dose of loratadine had any significant effect on the methacholine dose-response relationship. In the skin, loratadine also displaced the histamine log-concentration response curves to the Right_HP with concentration ratios of 4.7 and 6.7, respectively. Loratadine, 10 and 20 mg, had no protective effect on the early or late-phase bronchoconstrictor responses to inhaled allergen. In the skin, loratadine, 20 mg, significantly inhibited the mean wheal area to allergen. Thus, in the dose regimens studied, although loratadine is a moderately potent and selective H1 antagonist in the skin and airways, it failed to attenuate the early and late airway responses to inhaled allergen.

Legal treatment of the asthmatic worker: a major problem for the nineties.Workers with pre-existing Asthma_ASDPTO_HP that has become "aggravated" by stimuli in the workplace can be "disabled" in a legal sense. Should workers compensation be extended to provide disability benefits when the aggravating stimuli are ubiquitous, when the employment relationship was brief, when separation from the offending stimuli ends symptoms, or when hyperreactivity can be medically managed?

Home nebulizers: can optimal therapy be predicted by laboratory studies?Twenty patients (six Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, 14 Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP, Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP) were referred for consideration of domiciliary nebulized treatment. A double blind laboratory assessment demonstrated similar subjective and objective responses to nebulized salbutamol (5 mg), ipratropium bromide (IB) (0.5 mg) or a mixture of these Medications_ASDPTO in both groups of patients. The patients subsequently self-administered each treatment four times daily for one month. Fourteen patients requested long-term home nebulizer treatment (three salbutamol, four ipratropium bromide, seven mixture), and nine of these had their highest domiciliary peak flow recordings during home nebulizer treatment. However, subjective and objective laboratory assessments did not clearly predict the patients long-term choice of therapy in any case. There was little overall correlation between the laboratory response and the domiciliary response to treatment (Spearman correlation coefficient; subjective score, laboratory vs. home, r = 0.27, P = 0.03; peak flow response 30 min after treatment, laboratory vs. home, r = 0.31, P less than 0.02). The hospital study was also unreliable in predicting side effects during domiciliary nebulizer use. We conclude that prospective laboratory studies are of little value in the assessment of patients for home nebulizer therapy; these assessments must be made by carefully supervised domiciliary trials of nebulized treatment.

[Weaning an asthmatic using biphasic positive airway pressure together with continuous sufentanil administration].A patient presenting with Status_asthmaticus_HP associated with protracted Hypoventilation_HP (paCO2 = 90 mmHg) and impaired consciousness underwent sedation and controlled mechanical ventilation. The peak airway pressure could be reduced by constant-volume mechanical ventilation and analgosedation with midazolam and ketamine. When the gas exchange had stabilized, the first attempt at weaning was made by synchronized Recurrent_HP mechanical ventilation (SIMV). After this and two other attempts had failed, the patient was given continuous sufentanil (0.8-1.0 micrograms/kg), as well as additional bolus injections of 2 micrograms/kg and 0.35 micrograms/kg for analgosedation. Controlled mechanical ventilation was replaced by the system of biphasic positive airway pressure (BIPAP). The mechanical ventilatory support was gradually reduced, as was the dose of continuous sufentanil. Extubation was possible at a dose of 0.2 micrograms/kg per h sufentanil and CPAP. From this case, it is not possible to determine whether the BIPAP system or the analgosedation with Sufentanil was the decisive factor in the therapeutic success. It may well have been the combination of both therapeutic measures that--in our opinion--supplemented each other in an ideal way.

[An analysis of the atrovent bronchodilator tests in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP patients].The aim of the study is to find out the optimum time for reading of the rapid bronchodilation inhalatory test with atrovent in Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients. The changes of the forced vital capacity, the forced expiratory flow for I s and the maximum expiratory flow were followed up in 21 Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients 15 min after atrovent inhalation and in 10 patients--20 and 30 min after the inhalation. The results showed a minimum bronchodilation response after 15 min which does not give information about the reversibility of the bronchial obstruction in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. A well-expressed bronchodilation, statistically significant, was found 30 min after the inhalation of atrovent.

[Androstenedione, DHEA sulfate, cortisol, aldosterone and testosterone in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP patients].The basic level and the 24 h rhythm of secretion of cortisol, aldosterone, androstanedion, DHEA-sulfate and testosterone were determined in 26 men with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, 19 up to 50 years of age, in a free from attacks period. 20 of the patients had never been treated with corticosteroids and 6 patients had used corticosteroid drugs. In 26.32% of the patients who had not been treated with corticosteroids the basic cortisole level was either decreased or on the lower normal limit. At the same time in 55% of these patients a different degree increase of the basic DHEA-sulfate level was found and in 30% of the patients the androstanedione basic level was increased. The changes in the 24 h rhythm of androstanedione and DHEA-sulfate secretion were similar to those of cortisol. Normal rhythm of secretion of cortisol, aldosterone and testosterone was established mainly in patients with preserved basic hormonal secretion. In contrast to these, normal rhythm of androstanedione and DHEA-sulfate secretion was found more frequently in patients with increased basic secretion of these hormones.

Predictive factors for hand Eczema_HP.Factors related to hand Eczema_HP were studied. Their relative importance as predictors was ranked by multiple logistic regression analysis. Questionnaires were sent to 20,000 individuals aged 20-65 years, randomly selected from the population register. Those subjects (1385) considering themselves to have had hand Eczema_HP within the previous 12 months were invited to a dermatological examination. It was found that a history of childhood Eczema_HP was the most important predictive factor for hand Eczema_HP. Second was female sex, followed by occupational exposure, a history of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and/or Allergic_rhinitis_HP, and a service occupation. A small decrease in risk with advancing age was also found. The difference in the probability of having had Eczema_HP in a 1-year period, between individuals having the most important risk factors studied and those having none of them, proved to be for females 48% compared to 8%, and for males 34% compared to 4%. A history of childhood Eczema_HP was found to be more common among young persons, indicating an increase in the prevalence of Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP. Of those individuals who reported childhood Eczema_HP, 27% reported hand Eczema_HP on some occasion during the last 12 months.

[Clinico-immunologic aspects of using mildronate in patients with bronchopulmonary diseases].The immunity status of 35 patients with Chronic_Bronchitis_HP and infectious and allergic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was studied. Defects in the humoral immunity were revealed. To correct the immunity status, all the patients were treated with mildronate. The immunomodulatory effect of mildronate was found in all the groups of the patients. Mildronate was shown to increase the activity of a secondary immune response and the bronchial potency in the persons with infectious and allergic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

[The efficacy of treating Asthma_ASDPTO_HP patients at Khodzhaobigarm health resort].A complex of therapeutic factors including mountain climate, pararadon procedures and measured muscular loads was used in 96 patients on treatment for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP at Khodzhaobigarm health resort (1960 m above the sea level). As evident from clinicofunctional, allergological and immunological findings, the complex has a multifactor hyposensitizing and immunocorrective effect promoting normalization of bronchial receptor excitability, improvement of the lung mechanics and higher exercise tolerance.

Ipratropium bromide: are patients treated with optimal therapy?A double-blind crossover placebo controlled study was performed on 20 patients with Stable_HP Chronic_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, in order to obtain dose response data to ipratropium bromide (40, 80, 200 micrograms) given by metered dose inhaler. The use of the 200 micrograms dose gave a significantly greater peak effect and duration of action than the recommended standard therapeutic dose of 40 micrograms. There were marked individual variations in response to higher doses. Maximum response detected by spirometry occurred within 24 hours of inhalation, thus patients likely to gain clinical benefit are readily identified. The higher dose was well tolerated by most patients and may have clinical application in the treatment of patients who do not respond to the standard dose regime.

Osmolality and pH of anti-asthmatic drug solutions.Mixtures of different drugs are frequently used in aerosol solution for treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. These drugs have different pH and osmolality values as stock solutions. It has been suggested that acidity and osmolality interact in provoking bronchoconstriction and Cough_HP. Therefore, pH and osmolality of anti-asthmatic drug solutions and mixtures were measured in the nebulizer at 0, 1, 2, 5, 10 and 15 minutes of nebulisation, pH of fenoterol, ipratropium bromide, salbutamol and disodium cromoglycate ranged between 2.0 and 5.7 and did not change during nebulisation. Nearly all drug solutions were hypoosmolar and the osmolality increased during nebulisation with 11 to 62%. Therefore, it is suggested to dilute these drugs with saline 0.9% and to restrict nebulisation time to 10 minutes, since the most striking increase of osmolality was noted after 10 minutes.

[Effects of procaterol on arterial blood gas and pulmonary function in asthmatic children].We examined the changes in arterial blood gas, FEV1 and V50 after the inhalation of procaterol on 19 occasions in 16 asthmatic children. The initial value of PaO2 had statistically significant correlation with the initial values of %FEV1 and %V50. PaO2 fell down in 11 out of 19 (57.9%) and remarkably decreased more than 5 mmHg in 6 out of 19 (31.6%). The fall in PaO2 was most significant at 5 min after the inhalation in almost subjects. The changes in PaO2 after the inhalation had good correlation with the initial value of %FEV1 and %V50. The initial values were quite lower in the patients with decreased PaO2 more than 5 mmHg than those with increased PaO2. Severe_HP patients showed statistically low values of the initial PaO2 and %V50 and showed a fall in PaO2 after inhalation compared with Moderate_HP patients. An increase in A-aDO2 elicited that deteriorations of V/Q ratio caused a decrease in PaO2 after inhalation. There were no significant changes in heart rates and no complaints of Nausea_HP, Headache_HP or Tremor_HP.

Comparison of Berodual and salbutamol in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP: a multicenter evaluation.A 2-month study was carried out to compare the efficacy and safety of Berodual (B) (Boehringer Ingelheim) and salbutamol (S) in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. B is a combined agent with 20 micrograms of ipratropium bromide and 50 micrograms of fenoterol in each metered aerosol puff. Each puff of S contained 100 micrograms of drug. 196 patients were included in the study and received 4 x 2 puffs a day of either B or S. FEV1 and FVC were measured every month, and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) 4 times a day, i.e. morning and evening before and after administration of drug. Improvement of PEFR was the same in the two groups. No tachyphylaxis occurred. No difference was observed between the two drugs with regard to heart and respiratory rate, Dyspnea_HP and blood pressure. Tremor_HP seemed less Frequent_HP with B but this difference was not statistically significant. B achieved the same effects as S though containing less beta-2-agonist agent.

Persistence of toluene diisocyanate-induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP despite negligible workplace Exposures_ASDPTO.Six polyurethane foam workers were shown to have TDI-induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP by specific inhalation challenge testing. All remained in the workplace in jobs with minimal TDI Exposures_ASDPTO. Mean and time-weighted average exposure concentration for the asthmatic group was 0.64 +/- 0.46 ppb, less than 5 percent of the permissible exposure limit and significantly less (p less than 0.01) than the mean TWA Exposures_ASDPTO occurring in the foam line and the finishing workers. Serial evaluation of the respiratory health of these six showed all persisted with respiratory symptoms, none had improvement in bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine, and three had a greater than 15 percent decline in FEV1 on one of the days of spirometric testing over the five-year period from 1982 to 1986. Although we could not have predicted the outcome of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP had these workers Left_HP the workplace and ceased isocyanate exposure entirely, occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP persisted despite negligible ongoing TDI Exposures_ASDPTO.

Eosinophil and neutrophil production of leukotriene C4 and B4: comparison of cells from asthmatic subjects and Healthy_HP donors.Production of LTC4 and LTB4 by eosinophils and neutrophils was compared between nine asymptomatic asthmatic subjects and eight Healthy_HP donors. We observed a statistically significant difference in LTC4 generated by eosinophils, but not LTB4 produced by neutrophils. These findings suggest a quantitative difference in eosinophils between asthmatic subjects and Healthy_HP donors.

Acid fog-induced bronchoconstriction. The role of hydroxymethanesulfonic acid.Hydroxymethanesulfonate (HMSA), the bisulfite (HSO3-) adduct of formaldehyde (CH2O), is a common constituent of California acid fogs. HMSA, most Stable_HP in a fog pH range of 3 to 5, dissociates at 6.6, the pH of the fluid lining human airways. The dissociation of inhaled HMSA should theoretically generate sulfur dioxide and CH2O, both of which have bronchoconstrictor potential. Thus, we hypothesized that HMSA may have a specific bronchoconstrictor effect independent of its strength as an acid. To determine whether HMSA has such an effect, 19 subjects with Mild_HP to Moderate_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were studied using two different protocols. Initially, a mouthpiece study was performed in which 9 subjects, on 2 separate days, inhaled five aerosols containing either sequentially increasing concentrations (0, 30, 100, 300, and 1000 microM) of HMSA in 50 microM sulfuric acid (H2SO4) or 50 microM H2SO4 alone. The subjects inhaled each aerosol for 3 min during tidal breathing at rest. Specific airway resistance (SRaw) was measured before and after each 3-min exposure. There were no significant differences in the mean changes in SRaw among the various aerosol Exposures_ASDPTO. To confirm this lack of bronchoconstrictor effect of HMSA, we then performed a chamber study in which 10 freely breathing, intermittently exercising subjects were exposed to fog containing either 1 mM HMSA in 5 mM H2SO4 or 5 mM H2SO4 alone for 1 h. SRaw was measured before, during, and at the end of the 1-h exposure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Receptors in airway disease. Beta-adrenoceptors in lung inflammation.Beta-adrenoceptor dysfunction and increase in airway reactivity can be induced by administration of gram-negative bacteria, endotoxin, viruses, and allergens in laboratory animals. However, the deterioration of lung beta-adrenoceptor function is not invariably associated with lung inflammation. Severe_HP asthmatics, but not asthmatics per se, show a diminished beta-adrenoceptor function of airway smooth muscle. These changes are probably a consequence of the active disease state rather than an intrinsic component of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Mediators released from inflammatory cells such as reactive oxygen species and fatty acid metabolites may directly or indirectly induce beta-adrenoceptor dysfunction. Beta-adrenoceptor function of leukocytes from asthmatic patients can be decreased as well and it is suggested that lymphokines like interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma may Affect_ASDPTO beta-adrenoceptor function. A disturbed beta-adrenoceptor function on inflammatory cells themselves may have consequences for their immune function, mediator release, and effect on surrounding tissues.

Receptors in asthmatic airways.Airway tissue obtained postmortem from nondiseased and Severe_HPly asthmatic human lung was used in functional, radioligand binding and autoradiographic studies to investigate aspects of various receptor systems for putative mediators of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Results indicate that Asthma_ASDPTO_HP does not involve an intrinsic abnormality of smooth muscle contractility to spasmogens. Nor was there any evidence for up-regulation of histamine H1-receptor, muscarinic cholinoceptor, or alpha 1-adrenoceptor function. Conversely, Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP involving intense airway inflammation resulted in significant beta-adrenoceptor dysfunction, probably caused by receptor uncoupling from adenylate cyclase. Evidence was also obtained for histamine and methacholine-induced release of a nonprostanoid, airway epithelium-derived inhibitory factor (EpDIF), which may have a significant dilator effect in the adjacent bronchial circulation. The activity of this potentially protective inhibitory autacoid system would be expected to be reduced in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, which commonly involves epithelium damage. The autoradiographic distribution of specific binding sites for 125I-labeled substance P (I-SP) was also determined in bronchi from Healthy_HP humans and asthmatics. In Sharp_HP contrast to guinea pig airways where high levels of binding were detected over smooth muscle, specific I-SP binding was sparse over human airway smooth muscle from both sources, while dense binding was associated with structures immediately beneath the epithelium and with deep submucosal glands. These data suggest a more significant role for SP in secretory processes than in spasmogenic processes in human bronchi and highlight the potential for drawing invalid conclusions concerning human airway function from studies using animal models.

Autonomic nervous system abnormalities and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Autonomic nervous system function has been studied both in vitro and in vivo using a variety of methodologies. In asthmatic patients, beta-adrenergic hyporesponsiveness and alpha-adrenergic and cholinergic hyperresponsiveness can be frequently demonstrated. These observations have provided support for the beta blockade theory of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, advanced in the late 1960s by Andor Szentivanyi's experiments involving sensitized rodents. However, in addition to Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, aberrations in autonomic nervous system function have been noted in other individuals including cystic fibrosis patients and their parents, patients with Emphysema_HP and Bronchitis_HP, and in patients (Allergic_Rhinitis_HP and Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP) who have demonstrable IgE antibody responses to a variety of antigens. Thus, although these defects are not specific for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, it is noteworthy that these conditions share many clinical features; the ultimate phenotypic expression of these abnormalities may depend on both genetic and environmental factors that have yet to be defined.

The hormonal response to exercise in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The hormonal responses to exercise of 10 asthmatic patients and 12 normal subjects were compared by studying the changes in the plasma levels of growth hormone, prolactin, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol induced by treadmill running. The asthmatic patients demonstrated absence of the plasma cortisol response to exercise (peak increment -15 +/- 21 (SEM) vs 108 +/- 34 nmol.l-1 p less than 0.02). None of these patients were being treated with systemic corticosteroids and there was no difference between the responses of users and non-users of beclomethasone dipropionate. The results suggest the presence of an impaired adrenocortical response to the stress of physical exercise in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and indicate the need for detailed evaluation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function in patients with the disease.
The hormonal response to exercise in asthma.The hormonal responses to exercise of 10 asthmatic patients and 12 normal subjects were compared by studying the changes in the plasma levels of growth hormone, prolactin, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol induced by treadmill running. The asthmatic patients demonstrated absence of the plasma cortisol response to exercise (peak increment -15 +/- 21 (SEM) vs 108 +/- 34 nmol.l-1 p less than 0.02). None of these patients were being treated with systemic corticosteroids and there was no difference between the responses of users and non-users of beclomethasone dipropionate.

Neutrophil chemotactic activity in toluene diisocyanate (TDI)-induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.We quantitated serum neutrophil chemotactic activity (NCA), which is associated with mast cell or basophil activation, to determine if mast cell or basophil mediators are released during bronchoprovocation-inhalation challenge with subirritant levels of toluene diisocyanate (TDI). Four subjects with suspected TDI-induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and four mite-sensitive subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP who served as a comparison group were studied. NCA was measured in a multiwell, microchemotaxis chamber. Blood samples were collected, and FEV1 measurements were performed before challenge and at regular intervals during the subsequent 24 hours. Three of four workers clinically sensitive to TDI reacted to a subirritant TDI exposure. There was no increase in NCA during placebo challenges. NCA increased in the three TDI-sensitive workers during early and late asthmatic reactions in quantities proportional to the FEV1 decline. No increase in NCA was found during TDI Exposures_ASDPTO in the TDI-negative worker. Gel filtration analysis demonstrated the main NCA fraction eluted with macromolecules of an estimated molecular weight greater than 440,000 daltons. This characteristic is compatible with neutrophil chemotactic factor of basophil or mast cell origin. The kinetics of NCA release were similar in mite- and TDI-induced asthmatic reactions. A high correlation (r = 0.97; p = 0.0006) was obtained between the percent decrease in FEV1 during early asthmatic reactions and percent increase in NCA. These observations support the hypothesis that activation of mast cells or basophils is associated with TDI-induced early and late asthmatic reaction.

A 3-month evaluation of the efficacy of nedocromil sodium in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of nedocromil sodium conducted by a Canadian multicenter study group.Nedocromil sodium is a pyranoquinoline dicarboxylic acid derivative, formulated in a metered-dose inhaler. Because nedocromil sodium has in vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory properties, it was evaluated in a group of steroid-dependent patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP to observe how well it might be tolerated and for evidence of any beneficial effects. In a double-blind, group-comparative study, 127 patients received nedocromil sodium and 61 received placebo, administered as two puffs of 2 mg, four times per day, for 12 weeks. Ten patients developed adverse reactions, seven receiving active drug and three patients receiving placebo. Two patients of each group withdrew because of worsening Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Despite selecting patients whose Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was Stable_HP, when they were receiving established therapeutic regimens that included steroids and bronchodilators, it was found that diary-card symptom scores, morning and evening peak expiratory flow rate values, and inhaled beta-agonist usage all demonstrated slight but significant benefit with addition of nedocromil sodium. It is concluded that the inhaled, anti-inflammatory agent, nedocromil sodium, may be added to Asthma_ASDPTO_HP-treatment regimens with the reasonable expectation of further modest symptomatic benefit.

Long-term treatment with glucocorticoids/ACTH in Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic children. III. Effects on growth and adult height.The effect on growth of long-term treatment with prednisolone and/or ACTH (tetracosactrin) depot preparation was studied in 40 children with Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Height velocity was subnormal before treatment. During treatment the group of 17 children primarily treated with ACTH showed a Moderate_HP increase in mean velocity. Their height was not significantly altered, and neither was the age at peak height velocity nor adult height. In the group of 23 children treated with prednisolone the mean velocity decreased, resulting in a relative decrease in height. Peak height velocity was delayed by about 2 years in the boys but occurred at the expected time in the girls, as did menarche. Mean adult height was lower than expected after adjustment for mid-parenteral height. In 10 children ACTH was substituted for prednisolone, and their height velocity increased but not enough to Affect_ASDPTO adult height, which was just as low as in the patients treated with prednisolone only.

Persistent reactive airway dysfunction syndrome after exposure to toluene diisocyanate.Two police officers developed Asthma_ASDPTO_HP like illness after a single but Prolonged_HP exposure to toluene diisocyanate (TDI) by being in the immediate vicinity of a tank car that had overturned on a highway. One officer experienced upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms with Chest_tightness_HP about 4.5 hours after initial exposure. Respiratory_distress_HP, Cough_HP, and Wheezing_HP were noted the following day. The other experienced symptoms immediately on exposure, developed Respiratory_distress_HP 20 minutes later, and presented with Wheezing_HP four hours after that. Follow up examinations over seven years showed persistence of respiratory symptoms and continuation of airway hyperreactivity requiring treatment.

Subsensitivity of beta-adrenoceptor responses in asthmatic patients taking regular low dose inhaled salbutamol.Tremor_HP (Tr), chronotropic (HR) and metabolic (K, Glu) responses to cumulative doses of inhaled salbutamol (100 micrograms to 4000 micrograms) were compared in an age and sex matched group of 7 normal (N) and asthmatic (A) subjects. Comparison of regression lines between groups showed differences in HR and K. This was also reflected in attenuation of maximum responses in group A, for HR and K. These results show subsensitivity of chronotropic and hypokalaemic responses in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, which may reflect tachyphylaxis from the effects of long term inhaled salbutamol therapy.

Decreased activity of the platelet Na+,K(+)-adenosine triphosphatase enzyme in allergic subjects.A pathogenic role and abnormal function have both been ascribed to the blood platelet in Allergy_HP, but the explanation for these observations is unknown. This study compared the cation-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase enzyme (ATPase) activities of platelets from allergic (n = 18), potentially allergic (asymptomatic, positive skin test, n = 5) and normal patients (n = 10), all of whom were without symptoms at the time of the study. Platelets were separated by centrifugation, were sonicated, and were assayed for cation-dependent ATPase activity by spectrophotometry. The mean Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity (in nanomoles per microgram protein per minute) of allergic subjects (0.94 +/- 1.28) was significantly lower than that of normal subjects (3.93 +/- 1.58). No Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity was detectable in platelets from eight of the allergic subjects. The Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity of potentially allergic subjects was intermediate between those of the allergic and normal subjects. A significant negative correlation (p less than 0.01) was observed between serum IgE levels and platelet Na+,K(+)-ATPase values, thus suggesting a relationship between the reduced platelet Na+,K(+)-ATPase and IgE immunoglobulin. No such differences were observed for the Ca+(+)- and Mg+(+)-stimulated ATPases. In vivo dysfunction of the plasma membrane Na+,K(+)-ATPase enzyme in allergic subjects could have Profound_HP effects on levels of intracellular cations and thus platelet activation and function.

A double-blind multicenter group comparative study of the efficacy and safety of nedocromil sodium in the management of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. North American Tilade Study Group.To determine the efficacy of nedocromil sodium in adult Asthma_ASDPTO_HP patients using bronchodilators alone to control their disease, a consecutive sample of 127 patients with long-term Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was studied for 16 weeks. The patients were maintained on sustained release theophylline preparations (SRT) and inhaled and oral beta-adrenergic bronchodilators (beta 2). One hundred sixteen patients (90 percent) completed the study; one placebo-treated patient withdrew owing to throat irritation and Wheezing_HP. Nedocromil sodium provided an additional benefit to adult patients receiving SRT and inhaled beta 2-agonists. With the exception of night-time Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, nedocromil sodium maintained this improvement for the final 12 weeks of the study despite a reduction in concomitant bronchodilator therapy.

Effect of inhaled preservatives on asthmatic subjects. I. Sodium metabisulfite.Sodium metabisulfite (MBS) is used as a preservative in food and wine and frequently triggers attacks of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. To determine the characteristics of responses to inhaled MBS, 30 asthmatic subjects and 16 nonasthmatic subjects inhaled MBS, in concentrations of 6.2, 12.5, 50, and 100 mg/ml, from a DeVilbiss No. 40 nebulizer (DeVilbiss Co., Somerset, PA) in doses ranging from 0.1 to 12.8 mumol. Response was measured as the dose that caused a 20% fall in FEV1 (PD20FEV1). All the asthmatic subjects responded; one of the atopic, nonasthmatic subjects responded and none of the nonatopic, nonasthmatic subjects responded. The response occurred within 1 min, and most subjects recovered to within 10% of baseline after 30 to 40 min. Dose-response curves to MBS were steep and were reproducible, within a 7-day period, to within one doubling dose, with mean PD20FEV1 values of 2.17 and 2.11 mumol in 11 subjects. There was no correlation between PD20FEV1 values to MBS and histamine, and inhalation of MBS did not enhance responses to subsequent challenge with histamine (mean PD20FEV1 to histamine was 0.65 mumol and to histamine 1 h after MBS was 0.74 mumol). Challenge with MBS (mean PD20FEV1 4.07 mumol) did not cause refractoriness to a second challenge 1 h later (mean PD20FEV1 5.39 mumol). Of 20 subjects tested, prior inhalation of 8 mg nedocromil sodium blocked the response to MBS in 15 subjects and reduced it in two others. Cromolyn sodium (4 mg) blocked the response to MBS in three subjects but did not alter the mean PD20FEV1 in the remaining 17 subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

The abnormal in vitro response to aspirin of platelets from aspirin-sensitive asthmatics is inhibited after inhalation of nedocromil sodium but not of sodium cromoglycate.1. Blood platelets from patients with aspirin-sensitive Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (ASA) generated cytotoxic mediators in the presence of aspirin. This abnormal in vitro response to aspirin was abolished within 1 h after nedocromil sodium inhalation but not after sodium cromoglycate inhalation. 2. Platelets recovered this reactivity to aspirin by 12 hours after nedocromil sodium treatment of ASA-patients. 3. The in vitro reactivity to aspirin of ASA platelets isolated before inhalation was inhibited in the presence of serum isolated 15 and 60 min after nedocromil sodium inhalation.

Metabolic and hormonal responses to salbutamol in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Evidence of beta-adrenergic Overactivity_ASDPTO?The possibility that beta-adrenergic hyposensitivity may be involved in the pathogenesis of bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP remains a controversial issue. The hormonal, metabolic and cardiovascular responses to selective beta 2-adrenergic stimulation with salbutamol were compared in 11 asthmatic and 11 non-asthmatic subjects. There was no consistent difference between the two groups in the plasma free fatty acid, glucose and potassium responses, or in the cardiovascular variables studied, but the asthmatic patients demonstrated a marked dose-dependent hyperinsulinaemic response to salbutamol. Although this phenomenon cannot be accounted for with certainty, it may be a manifestation of pancreatic beta-adrenergic Overactivity_ASDPTO which would not be in keeping with the concept of Generalized_HP hyposensitivity of beta-adrenergic mechanisms in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The present results provide a clear demonstration of the difficulties involved in attempts to relate extrapulmonary autonomic phenomena to the pathogenesis of bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

BIO-Fully Automated Sample Treatment high-performance liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay for leukotriene E4 in human urine from Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics.BIO-Fully Automated Sample Treatment (BIO-FAST) high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is a sophisticated column-switching technique in which a fresh pre-column is used for each sample prior to reversed-phase HPLC. The pre-columns, Varian Advanced Automated Sample Processor (AASP) cartridges, are held and automatically advanced by the Varian AASP. A rapid and efficient extraction and separation for leukotrienes C4 and E4 from human urine has been developed using a C8 cartridge and subsequent C18 analytical HPLC column. Quantitation of leukotriene E4, accomplished by post-column radioimmunoassay, shows significantly increased leukotriene E4 concentrations in urine samples from Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics after antigen challenge. This further confirms an active role for leukotrienes in the pathogenesis of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Clinical relevance of ventilation-perfusion inequality determined by inert gas elimination.The first part of this review deals with the basic mechanisms and factors determining hypoxaemia and Hypercapnia_HP and the different approaches used in clinical practice and in clinical research to assess the presence of ventilation-perfusion mismatching, shunt and diffusion limitation for oxygen, and more specifically the multiple inert gas elimination technique (MIGET), in pulmonary medicine. The second part reviews three different respiratory disorders where the complex interplay between intrapulmonary and extrapulmonary factors regulating oxygen are essentially interpreted through the results afforded by the MIGET over the last decade. The gas exchange response to bronchodilators in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, an airway disease, and then the major determinants governing abnormal gas exchange in Acute_HP Pulmonary_embolism_HP, a pulmonary vascular disorder, and during haemodialysis, a respiratory entity of extrapulmonary origin, are successively explored in the light of the inert gas method.

Effects of histamine on alpha adrenergic receptor expression on the lymphocytes of normal and asthmatic subjects.Low levels of [3H]-dihydroergocryptine (DHE) (alpha adrenergic receptor) binding to Peripheral_HP blood mononuclear leukocytes from asthmatic subjects were significantly increased following incubation with histamine. In contrast, [3H]-DHE binding was undetectable both before and after histamine incubation using cells from nonasthmatic subjects. The change in binding showed a biphasic dose dependence on histamine and was not associated with changes in DHA (beta-2 receptor) or yohimbine (alpha-2 receptor) binding. The induction of alpha adrenergic receptors by the ubiquitous inflammatory mediator histamine may help explain the alpha adrenergic hyperresponsiveness seen in asthmatic patients.

Superoxide generation by hypodense eosinophils from patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Low density, or hypodense eosinophils (HE) are found in increased numbers in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Since HE have been reported to have increased inflammatory potential and correlate with the Severity_HP of airway obstruction, it has been suggested that this subpopulation of eosinophils may contribute to the Asthma_ASDPTO_HP process. However, investigations to define the function of HE in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP have been limited. In this study, pure populations of both HE and normal dense eosinophils were isolated from the Peripheral_HP blood of seven patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, and functional activity of these cells was determined by measuring superoxide (O2-) generation to several activators. Compared to normal dense eosinophils, HE generated significantly more O2- when activated with the chemotactic peptide FMLP or opsonized zymosan; however, these differences were small. In contrast, no difference was observed in O2- production between normal- and low-density eosinophils from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP patients when stimulated by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or the calcium ionophore A23187. Furthermore, both eosinophil populations, and corresponding neutrophil isolates, from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP patients generated significantly more O2- than control granulocytes when activated by PMA. When stimulated by calcium ionophore, all three eosinophil populations released equivalent amounts of O2-, which were, however, higher than from both neutrophil suspensions. Compared to increased activity found in some other hypereosinophilic conditions, blood HE in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP do not necessarily have enhanced function. This suggests that eosinophil Heterogeneous_HP extends not only to cell density but is also reflected in cell function and that these cell variations are dependent on many factors, including the function assessed, source of cells (normal versus patients with some diseases), and stimulus used.

Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases and methyltransferases in purified lymphocytes, monocytes and polymorphonuclear leucocytes from Healthy_HP donors and asthmatic patients.Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase and phospholipid N-methyl-transferase activities were simultaneously measured in purified polymorphonuclear cell-, mononuclear cell-, lymphocyte- and monocyte-homogenates from control subjects, from patients with atopic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and from patients with non-atopic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Whereas cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase activities were found to be about 10-fold lower in polymorphonuclear than in mononuclear cells, phospholipid N-methyltransferase proved to be rather similar in each cell type from control donors. Cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase and phospholipid N-methyltransferase were significantly decreased in polymorphonuclear cells and monocytes from asthmatic patients compared with the control group while cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase was significantly impaired only in the monocyte subpopulation.

The effects of theophylline on beta 2-adrenoceptors on polymorphonuclear leukocytes of asthmatic children and juveniles. Increase in receptor density and prevention of agonist-induced down-regulation.The density (Bmax) and affinity (KD) of beta 2-adrenoceptors in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) were measured in 29 children and juveniles with Mild_HP or Moderate_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and in 25 Healthy_HP control subjects using the highly specific radioligand (+/-)-125I-cyanopindolol. No significant difference in Bmax was found between asthmatic subjects without medication and the control group. The asthmatic subjects were divided into four different groups by their actual medication: no medication, adrenergics, theophylline, adrenergics plus theophylline. Analysis of variance revealed highly significant differences between these groups for Bmax (P = 0.0016) but not for KD. In asthmatics on adrenergic therapy Bmax was significantly lower (995 +/- 415) than in asthmatics without medication (1660 +/- 521; P = 0.008). In contrast, Bmax in asthmatics on theophylline therapy was significantly higher (2137 +/- 231; P = 0.009) than in the controls. Bmax was average in the group of asthmatics treated with both adrenergics and theophylline (1619 +/- 547). It is concluded that in asthmatic subjects therapy with theophylline increases the density of beta 2-adrenoceptors and partly prevents their down-regulation induced by adrenergic therapy.

Asthma_ASDPTO_HPgenic properties of a newly developed detergent ingredient: sodium iso-nonanoyl oxybenzene sulphonate.The suspicion that a newly developed detergent ingredient, sodium iso-nonanoyl oxybenzene sulphonate (SINOS), was inducing Asthma_ASDPTO_HP among a workforce led to a series of inhalation challenge tests to determine the specificity and dose response characteristics of its Asthma_ASDPTO_HP provoking properties. Three previously exposed workers, three non-exposed non-asthmatic controls, and three non-exposed asthmatic controls were challenged with SINOS 0.01-100 micrograms and another chemically similar surface active detergent ingredient, linear alkyl benzene sulphonate (LAS) 0.01-100 micrograms. asthmatic symptoms, late Falls_HP in FEV1, and increases in non-specific bronchial responsiveness were seen after the inhalation of SINOS in all three workers, confirming SINOS as a cause of occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. No changes were seen after the inhalation of SINOS in either group of control subjects nor after LAS in any subject. These findings suggest that SINOS causes Asthma_ASDPTO_HP through a specific hypersensitivity mechanism unrelated to its surface active properties.

Platelet role in pathogenesis of atopic and nonimmunologic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Platelet activating factor (PAF) holds the leading role among Allergy_HP mediators in pathogenesis of bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. PAF ability to induce bronchospasms is manifested in the presence of intact platelets. Platelet function in patients with atopic and nonimmunologic aspirin-induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was investigated. Aggregation increase (platelet activation) correlating with IgE level and mediator release from target cells of I order was stated to be the most important component of pathologic process in atopy. Under the influence of aggregation inducers (ADP and adrenaline) in platelets of patients with atopic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP the level of cAMP is reduced, greater amounts of TxB2 and PGF2 alpha are produced. In cyclo-oxygenase blockade their production is not stopped. The decrease of platelet ability to aggregate is observed in patients with nonimmunologic aspirin-induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. In non-stimulated platelets high levels of PGF2 alpha and TxB2 are noted. Their production is somewhat reduced and cAMP level is elevated during action of aggregation inducers on platelets preincubated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Metabolism disorder of membrane phospholipids affects platelet activity to fix Ig and to decrease receptor accessibility for action of aggregation inducers. Efficacy of therapy by different anti-allergic drugs depends greatly on the drug ability to normalize platelet function. Analysis of platelet functions is of great importance for Diagnosis_ASDPTO of atopic and nonimmunologic forms of bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and for choice of adequate therapy.

Decreased neutral endopeptidases: possible role in inflammatory diseases of airways.Neutral endopeptidase exists on the membranes of many cells in the airways. By cleaving and thus inactivating tachykinins released from sensory nerves, NEP limits the actions of these peptides. The selectivity of the enzyme is due, at least in part, to its close association with tachykinin receptors. By cleaving and inactivating the tachykinins, it limits the concentration of tachykinin that reaches the receptor. Decreased NEP activity produced by selective enzyme inhibitors, air pollutants, infections, and oxidants leads to exaggerated neurogenic inflammation. We speculate that the multiple stimuli that enter the airways of Healthy_HP individuals normally produce small, nonsymptomatic neurogenic inflammatory responses. However, when NEP activity is decreased, the responses become exaggerated and may contribute to the pathogenesis of diseases such as Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Bronchitis_HP.

A placebo-controlled blinded comparison of nedocromil sodium and beclomethasone dipropionate in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Two hundred and two patients aged 12-78 with chiefly Moderate_HP to Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP took part in a multicenter randomized blinded group comparison of nedocromil sodium (NS) 4 mg four times daily, beclomethasone dipropionate (BD) 0.1 mg four times daily, and placebo. Patients were assessed at the start and end of a two week baseline and after three and six weeks of treatment. Compared with placebo, both NS and BD significantly improved daytime dyspnoea and day and nighttime Cough_HP, as assessed by diary card scores. Lung function (FEV1) was significantly improved in the BD group. In the NS group there was also a significant reduction in concomitant use of inhaled beta 2-agonists. Overall opinions of efficacy by clinicians and patients were significantly in favor of both active treatments over placebo. There were no significant differences between the three treatments for peak expiratory flow rates, morning tightness or nighttime dyspnoea. Comparison between the two active treatments showed no significant differences in any of the variables.

Attenuation of exercise induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP by nedocromil sodium and sodium cromoglycate.A randomized double blind cross over trial to compare nedocromil sodium and sodium cromoglycate with placebo in the prevention of exercise induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was conducted. Twenty asthmatics received nedocromil sodium, sodium cromoglycate or placebo via metered dose inhalers on successive days 30 minutes before exercise in a randomized order. Nedocromil sodium and sodium cromoglycate gave sufficient protection (P less than 0.05) compared to placebo as assessed by the reduction in the maximum percentage fall in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). The protective effect of nedocromil sodium and sodium cromoglycate varied in individuals.

Patients' perception of distress due to symptoms and effects of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP on daily living and an investigation of possible influential factors.1. Distress ratings for questions relating to the symptoms and impacts of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP on daily living have been examined in 40 adult asthmatic outpatients. 2. The patients responded to each item in a 76-item questionnaire by marking a 10 cm visual analogue scale to indicate the degree of distress associated with the symptoms or state described in the question. The resulting score (as a percentage of 10 cm) was interpreted as the degree of distress associated with a particular item. 3. The possible influence on these distress scores of five factors, age, duration (time in years from Diagnosis_ASDPTO to interview), variability [recorded variability of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) expressed as amplitude per cent mean], sex and FEV1 (current and worst recorded in the clinic, expressed as per cent of predicted) was investigated. 4. From correlations of each item with age, 11/76 items were significant at P less than 0.05. Taking the results from all 76 items in a repeated measures analysis of variance, there was a small significant relationship between age and distress score (P = 0.048). The direction of the association was negative, suggesting that younger patients were less tolerant of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP; however, the effect of age only explained 1.5% of the total variance in scores of the 76 items. 5. From correlations of visual analogue scale score for each item against duration, 10/76 items were significant at P less than 0.05, but taking the 76 items overall there was no significant association (P = 0.2). 6. The remaining factors, sex, variability and FEV1, only showed a significant effect in 1/76, 1/76 and 5/76 items, respectively (P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Bronchoalveolar lavage and morphology of the airways after cessation of exposure in asthmatic subjects sensitized to toluene diisocyanate.To evaluate the morphologic basis of the different outcomes of toluene diisocyanate (TDI) Asthma_ASDPTO_HP after quitting occupational exposure, we examined ten patients with TDI Asthma_ASDPTO_HP who showed, at Diagnosis_ASDPTO, a positive TDI challenge test and nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness (NSBH) to methacholine. After Diagnosis_ASDPTO, all patients ceased work and a 4- to 40-month follow-up was obtained with three to eight determinations of the cumulative dose producing a 15 percent fall in FEV1 (PD15FEV1) methacholine in each patient. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and biopsy of bronchial muscosa were performed 3 to 39 months after cessation of work, in the absence of Acute_HP exacerbations of the disease. Total cell count in BAL fluid was Moderate_HPly increased in four of ten patients, eosinophils were increased in five of ten patients, and neutrophils were increased in eight of ten patients. Mucosal biopsy specimens of main or lobar bronchi were available in eight of ten patients; epithelial damage and thickening of basement membrane was observed in almost all patients, as well as a Mild_HP-to-Moderate_HP inflammatory reaction in the submucosa, mainly represented by lymphocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophils. No relationship was observed between the cellularity of BAL and the degree of NSBH at the time of BAL; mean values of total cells and differential count were not different between patients with presence or absence of the different histologic findings. Mucosal biopsy and BAL were performed also in four subjects exposed to dusts without respiratory symptoms or NSBH; similar findings were obtained except for the absence of eosinophils in BAL and a lesser degree of basement membrane thickening and inflammatory reaction in the submucosa. The study of the changes in NSBH after quitting exposure showed that five of ten patients had a significant improvement in NSBH to methacholine, as evaluated by a positive significant linear regression between months of work cessation and PD15FEV1 methacholine; only one of these five patients had an increased number of eosinophils in BAL fluid. By contrast, four of the five patients with persistent NSBH after quitting exposure had an increased number of eosinophils in BAL. We suggest that persistent NSBH in TDI Asthma_ASDPTO_HP after cessation of work may be related to an inflammatory reaction in which eosinophil infiltration seems to be a major determinant.

Measurement of leukotriene B4 in arterial blood of Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients during Wheezing_HP attacks.To investigate whether leukotriene B4 is present in the arterial blood of Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients during Wheezing_HP attacks, 20 ml of arterial blood was drawn from the inguinal artery of five patients. Leukotriene B4 was detected in all five individuals, and its identity was confirmed by a combination of high pressure liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay techniques. The concentration of leukotriene B4 was 48.34 +/- 16.27 pg ml-1 (mean value +/- SE). However, in five control subjects the leukotriene B4 concentration was found to be 9.43 +/- 5.44 pg ml-1. Thus there was a significant difference between the two groups (P less than 0.05). These results suggest that leukotriene B4 may be important in elucidation of the pathogenesis of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Time course of recovery of beta- and alpha 1-adrenoceptors in experimental Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.1. The time course of recovery of reduced beta-adrenoceptors caused by ovalbumin (OA) challenge was investigated using guinea-pigs. 2. The effects of prednisolone on the recovery time course were also evaluated. 3. beta- and alpha 1-receptor assays were performed using lung membranes. Adenylate cyclase activity was also measured. 4. OA challenge reduced the number of beta-adrenoceptors by 35%, and a significant decrease (13%) persisted for 7 days. The number of beta-adrenoceptor recovered after 14 days. 5. OA challenge elevated the number of alpha 1-adrenoceptors. A significant increase (24%) was observed after 7 days, and it took a further 7 days for the recovery. 6. After OA challenge there was a significant decrease in adenylate cyclase activity after 7 days, which recovered after a further 7 days. 7. Inhalation of prednisolone accelerated the recovery of beta-adrenergic responsiveness, though it did not Affect_ASDPTO the recovery of the number of alpha 1-adrenoceptors. Prednisolone inhalation also elevated beta-adrenergic responsiveness in non-asthmatic subjects. 8. It is concluded that reduced beta-adrenergic responsiveness caused by OA challenge persisted for 7 days and recovered after a further 7 days. Steroid hormone increased beta-adrenoceptors.

Generation of leukotriene B4 and C4 from granulocytes of normal controls, Allergic_Rhinitis_HP, and asthmatic subjects.We determined the relationship of allergic disease to the number and activity of eosinophils and their production of leukotriene B4 and leukotriene C4 (leukotriene D4 equivalents). Granulocytes from Allergic_Rhinitis_HP (AR) subjects and asthmatics release more LTC4 than normals. Furthermore, eosinophils of asthmatics generate more LTC4 than those of AR subjects.

Comparison of urinary leukotriene E4 and 16-carboxytetranordihydro leukotriene E4 excretion in allergic asthmatics after inhaled antigen.Antisera to 16-carboxytetranordihydro leukotriene E4 (tetranor LTE4), a major urinary oxidative metabolite (via omega- and beta-oxidation) of leukotriene E4 (LTE4) in primates, were obtained by immunisation of rabbits with a related, non-naturally occurring synthetic metabolite (16-carboxytetranordihydro leukotriene C4 ester) conjugated to Keyhole Limpit haemocyanin. Material which competed with [11, 12-3H]tetranor LTE4 for binding to this antisera was isolated from urine from allergic asthmatics by reversed-phase HPLC. This material eluted with the retention time of synthetic standards, and its mean urinary excretion was elevated during both the first three hours (6.13 +/- 2.15 ng/h) and 3-6 h (5.87 +/- 1.99 ng/h) after antigen inhalation, compared with baseline values (3.42 +/- 1.49 ng/h), in 5 allergic Mild_HP asthmatics. A much greater and statistically significant increase in urinary leukotriene E4 (LTE4) excretion, occurring in all subjects, was seen during Acute_HP antigen-induced bronchoconstriction (baseline, 1.62 +/- 0.66 ng/h; 0-3 h, 19.58 +/- 8.79 ng/h; p less than 0.05) in these subjects. These data support the suggestion that endogenous peptide leukotrienes are metabolised by omega- and subsequent beta-oxidation in man, but emphasize the relative importance of urinary LTE4 excretion after allergen elicited leukotriene generation, further substantiating a pathological role for peptide leukotrienes in allergic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Evaluation of beta-adrenergic function in normal and asthmatic children.Low levels of serum glucose have been observed in atopic individuals after a subcutaneous injection of epinephrine. This less than normal Hyperglycemia_HP could be evidence of partial beta-adrenergic blockade in atopy. We compared the basal values of glucose with those obtained after 30 and 60 minutes of a subcutaneous injection of epinephrine 1/1000 (0.006 ml/kg; maximum of 0.3 ml) in normal and atopic asthmatic children (Mild_HP, Moderate_HP, and Severe_HP). The glucose-oxidase method was used for the determination of glucose levels in Peripheral_HP blood. Glucose serum levels in normal children were significantly higher at 30 and 60 minutes compared with basal values. In patients with Mild_HP and Moderate_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, significantly higher values were observed only at 30 minutes. In Severe_HP asthmatics, the glucose levels at 30 minutes were not different from the basal values, but higher than those observed at 60 minutes. Comparison among the four groups showed significant differences between the nonatopic normal children and the Severe_HP asthmatic children at 30 and 60 minutes. The Moderate_HP asthmatic children showed significantly lower levels when compared with nonatopic normal children at 30 minutes.

Effect of facial cooling on mucosal blood flow in the mouth in humans.1. To determine the effects of facial cooling on intraoral thermal events, we placed a thermal conductivity sensor on the buccal surface of the Left_HP cheek in six normal and six asthmatic subjects. Room temperature and cold stimuli were then applied to the integument surface of both sides of the face while mucosal surface temperature and thermal conductivity, as an index of blood flow, were recorded. 2. The room temperature challenge had no effect. Application of the cold stimulus to the exterior of the Left_HP cheek caused a monotonic decrease in temperature in the mouth in all subjects and was associated with a change in thermal conductivity in which blood flow increased and then fell to baseline despite a continued drop in temperature. These responses were purely local in that cooling of the Right_HP side of the face did not change the temperature or blood flow on the Left_HP side. No differences were noted between the asthmatic and normal subjects. 3. The data indicate that lowering the temperature of the skin of the face produces significant alterations in the thermal environment within the mouth. With facial cooling, buccal temperature Falls_HP and mucosal blood supply transiently rises. This effect appears to be a purely local thermally mediated event. Facial pressure and cutaneous reflexes do not play a role. The above changes may contribute to the conditioning of inspired air during oral breathing.

[Nedocromil in the treatment of Chronic_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in children. A double-blind vs placebo study].After 2 weeks of observation, Nedocromil has been studied in double blind vs placebo for 8 weeks in 40 children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP of medium seriousness. Patients had to record on a clinical diary symptoms (Wheezing_HP and Cough_HP), beta 2-agonists consumption and collateral effects of the drug. Every 2 weeks patients had a clinical examination and the physician's judgement about the treatment's efficiency was registered. Patients who took the active drug had an improvement in symptoms from the 3rd week of observation and a significative decrease in bronchodilators' consumption. The judgement about the treatment's efficiency was different between physician and patients thus preventing the recognition of the patients who had taken Nedocromil from those who had taken placebo. We think that the different consumption of beta 2-agonists could be the reason for this behaviour between the 2 groups.

Tolerance to reduction of oral steroid dosage in Severe_HPly asthmatic patients receiving nedocromil sodium.We examined the efficacy of nedocromil sodium as an oral steroid sparing agent in a group of 37 Severe_HP, oral steroid-dependent asthmatics. All were receiving daily or alternate-day prednisone. These patients had taken part in an earlier, 12-week double-blind trial of nedocromil sodium 16 mg daily by inhalation or matching placebo. They continued with test treatment (26 patients on nedocromil sodium and 11 on placebo) on a double-blind basis for a further 12 weeks. During this time, patients visited the clinic every 2 weeks, when Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Severity_HP and symptoms were assessed. On the basis of these assessments, the dose of oral steroid was either decreased, or maintained at the same level, or the patient was withdrawn if the Asthma_ASDPTO_HP had deteriorated to a clinically unacceptable level. The nedocromil sodium group was able to achieve a greater percentage reduction in oral steroid dose (P less than 0.05). The rate of withdrawal due to worsening Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was 31% from active and 55% from placebo treatment. Trends in other variables (time before withdrawal and numbers of patients able to withstand complete removal of oral steroids) favoured nedocromil sodium but the differences between the groups were not statistically significant.

asthmatic airways have a disproportionate hyperresponsiveness to LTE4, as compared with normal airways, but not to LTC4, LTD4, methacholine, and histamine.Airways responsiveness to leukotriene (LT) C4, LTD4, LTE4, histamine, and methacholine have been studied in eight asthmatic and six normal subjects. Airways responsiveness to each bronchoconstrictor agonist was assessed by constructing cumulative dose-response curves, and the dose that produced a 35% decrease in specific airways conductance (PD35) was obtained by linear interpolation. Airways of subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were approximately 14-, 15-, 6-, 9-, and 219-fold more responsive to histamine, methacholine, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4, respectively, than were normal subjects. Thus, there was a substantially augmented level of hyperresponsiveness to LTE4 in bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, which was not observed for the other bronchoconstrictor agents, when compared to normal subjects. In contrast to LTC4 and LTD4, as histamine and methacholine responsiveness increase, the dose ratio of histamine to LTE4 (PD35 histamine/PD35 LTE4) and the dose ratio of methacholine to LTE4 also tended to increase. This suggests that as the nonspecific airways responsiveness increases, the relative potency of LTE4 also increases, whereas potency of LTC4 and LTD4 decrease. These results suggest that the mechanism of the bronchoconstriction induced by LTE4 may be distinct from that produced by LTC4 or LTD4 in subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. This may reflect leukotriene subtype receptor Heterogeneous_HP in asthmatic airways.

Decrease of beta-receptors after the antigen-specific bronchial provocation test in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Airway hyperreactivity to different stimuli is a characteristic feature of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The beta-adrenergic theory, as proposed by Szentivanyi in 1968, tried to explain with beta-adrenergic dysfunction, the cause not only of bronchial hyperreactivity but of all atopic diseases. In a previous work, we found that asymptomatic Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients presented a number of beta-receptors similar to that of a normal control group, while symptomatic Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients presented a significantly decreased number when compared to both groups (40% decrease). In view of these results, we proposed to study the possible changes in the number of beta-receptors in asymptomatic Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients after a bronchial provocation test. Fifteen patients, diagnosed of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and sensitive to the house dust mite, D. pteronyssinus, were studied. All were free of medication and asymptomatic at least 90 days before the study. A test of specific bronchial provocation was performed on 10 patients, determining the number of beta-receptors in basal conditions, after 30 minutes and 24 hours. The other five patients underwent an unspecific provocation test with methacholine, with determination of the beta-receptor number at basal conditions, and 24 hours later. Only a significant decrease (30.4%) was found in the beta-receptor numbers, 24 hours after specific bronchial provocation with p less than 0.025 with the Student test for paired data. With regards the beta-adrenergic theory of atopy, in our opinion our results show that the detected decrease of beta-receptors would be the consequence and not the cause of atopic diseases.

Comparative airway response to inhaled bradykinin, kallidin, and [des-Arg9]bradykinin in normal and asthmatic subjects.Bradykinin, kallidin (lys-bradykinin), and [des-Arg9]bradykinin are oligopeptides that may contribute as mediators in the pathogenesis of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP by interacting with specific receptors designated B1 and B2. In this study, we have investigated the airway response to inhaled bradykinin, kallidin, and [des-Arg9]bradykinin in normal and asthmatic subjects. Changes in airway caliber were followed as maximum expiratory flow at 30% of the vital capacity (Vp30) and as forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1). Only one of the six normal subjects responded to bradykinin at the maximum cumulative concentration (5.33 mg/ml). Neither kallidin nor [des-Arg9]bradykinin had any measurable bronchoconstrictor effect in the normal subjects whether airway caliber was measured as Vp30 or FEV1. In the 10 subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, bradykinin and kallidin, but not [des-Arg9]bradykinin, produced a concentration-related fall in FEV1. The geometric mean provocation concentrations of inhaled agonist reducing FEV1 by 20% of baseline were 0.03, 0.08, and 0.44 mg/ml for bradykinin, kallidin, and histamine, respectively. Bronchoconstriction produced by bradykinin and kallidin was maximal within 3 to 5 min with recovery occurring over 30 to 45 min. Because bradykinin and kallidin are agonists of B2 receptors and [des-Arg9]bradykinin is an agonist for B1 receptors, these in vivo structure activity studies suggest that asthmatic, but not normal, airways are hyperresponsive to kinins when compared to histamine and that this potent bronchoconstrictor action is a specific pharmacologic effect compatible with the stimulation of B2 receptors or a variant of these.

Occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP due to isocyanates in Singapore.Nine cases of occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP due to isocyanates are described. The isocyanates involved included toluene diisocyanate (TDI), diphenyl-methane diisocyanate (MDI) and polyisocyanates. The importance of asking the occupational history in a patient with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is illustrated. The importance of early Diagnosis_ASDPTO and removal from further exposure is also discussed.

Alpha- and beta-adrenergic-receptor systems in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and in subjects without Asthma_ASDPTO_HP: reduced mononuclear cell beta-receptors in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.We assessed the adrenergic-receptor system in individuals with bronchial hyperreactivity, beta-Adrenergic receptors on mononuclear cell membranes, alpha-adrenergic receptors on platelet membranes, and the cAMP response in these cell types to different stimuli, including platelet-activating factor (PAF), were determined. Studies were assessed in 10 subjects with Mild_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, six methacholine-sensitive subjects without Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, and 10 normal subjects. The density and affinity of beta-receptors and alpha-receptors were determined by Scatchard analysis. Our findings were that (1) subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP had a significantly lower density of beta-receptors compared to normal subjects, (2) subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP had a significantly lower cAMP response to isoproterenol stimulation compared to the two other groups, (3) in subjects without Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. PAF decreased the basal cAMP level and significantly inhibited the response to isoproterenol stimulation, (4) there was no difference in density and affinity of platelet alpha-receptors or in platelet cAMP responses to stimulation by alpha-agonists among these three groups, and (5) neither cAMP response or beta-receptor density on mononuclear cells were significantly correlated with pulmonary-function tests (FEV/FVC times 100), sensitivity to methacholine, or cold-air inhalation. These results suggest that patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP may have a lower isoproterenol cAMP response and decreased density of beta-adrenergic receptors on mononuclear cells in the absence of beta-agonist therapy. It is speculated that release of PAF and other mediators secondary to allergen exposure, even in the absence of overt attacks of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, may inhibit the response to endogenous or exogenous beta-adrenergic agonists.

Activity of angiotensin I converting enzyme in sarcoidosis, atopic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Acute_HP_Bronchitis_HP.The lungs have an important role in the synthesis of ACE. In BAL fluid and serum the ACE activity was determined in 18 patients with sarcoidosis (11 with high Severity_HP and 7 with low Severity_HP alveolitis), 25 patients with atopic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and 17 with Acute_HP_Bronchitis_HP. The activity of ACE was examined by a reagent set produced by Boehringer Mannheim Biochemica Test-Combination ACE cat. no. 789 011. In the high Severity_HP alveolitis group of sarcoidosis patients the ACE activity was significantly increased in BAL fluid and serum in comparison to other observed patients. On the other hand, in patients with atopic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP the ACE activity was also increased in comparison to Acute_HP_Bronchitis_HP and referred norms. These findings suggest a role of atopic processes or administered therapy in ACE secretion in the airways.

[Arachidonic acid metabolites on Peripheral_HP blood plasma in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].To assess the role of arachidonic acid metabolites in pathogenesis of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, we measured thromboxane B2 (TxB2), 6-keto PGF1 alpha, leukotriene (LT) C4, and LTB4 in venous blood plasma in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and in controls. The level of TxB2 was significantly higher in 18 Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics with attacks than that in 11 controls (77.3 +/- 48.8 pg/ml vs 48.8 +/- 9.4 pgml). The levels of 6-keto PGF1 alpha in both Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics with attacks (17.8 +/- 6.7 pg/ml) and without an attack (16.4 +/- 9.7) were significantly higher than that in controls (11.6 +/- 3.9 pg/ml). The levels of LTC4 in Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics with attacks (0.84 +/- 0.11 ng/ml, n = 11) were significantly higher than that in controls, furthermore the level of LTC4 in Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics without an attack. The level of LTB4 was significantly higher in Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics with attacks (295.0 +/- 160.7 pg/ml, n = 26) than that in controls (161.7 +/- 25.3 pg/ml, n = 12) and Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics without an attack (182.4 +/- 97.9 pg/ml, n = 22). These findings suggest that the arachidonic acid metabolites are related to the Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attack and are associated with the pathogenesis of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

The level of TxB2 was significantly higher in 18 asthmatics with attacks than that in 11 controls (77.3 +/- 48.8 pg/ml vs 48.8 +/- 9.4 pgml). The levels of 6-keto PGF1 alpha in both asthmatics with attacks (17.8 +/- 6.7 pg/ml) and without an attack (16.4 +/- 9.7) were significantly higher than that in controls (11.6 +/- 3.9 pg/ml). The levels of LTC4 in asthmatics with attacks (0.84 +/- 0.11 ng/ml, n = 11) were significantly higher than that in controls, furthermore the level of LTC4 in asthmatics without an attack. The level of LTB4 was significantly higher in asthmatics with attacks (295.0 +/- 160.7 pg/ml, n = 26) than that in controls (161.7 +/- 25.3 pg/ml, n = 12) and asthmatics without an attack (182.4 +/- 97.9 pg/ml, n = 22). These findings suggest that the arachidonic acid metabolites are related to the asthma attack and are associated with the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma.
A comparison of inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate and nedocromil sodium as additional therapy in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.We have compared the effects of inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) 400 micrograms day-1 with inhaled nedocromil sodium (NDS) 16 mg day-1 as additional therapy in adults with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP not fully controlled by regular beta-2-agonist inhalers with, or without, oral theophyllines. Seventeen subjects were entered into a 2-week baseline phase, and subsequently in a double-blind crossover fashion into two 8-week phases of daily BDP or NDS. Subjects recorded daily peak expiratory flow rates, morning and evening (PEF am and pm), symptom scores and beta-2-agonist inhaler use. Thirteen subjects completed the study and the last 2 weeks of each phase were analysed. Compared to baseline, both BDP and NDS caused a significant improvement in PEF am (P less than 0.05), PEF pm (P less than 0.05) and the 'amplitude % mean' (P less than 0.001). Both drugs gave a highly significant improvement in all symptom scores. There was no significant difference between BDP and NDS for PEF am, PEF pm, amplitude % mean, Cough_HP and daytime Asthma_ASDPTO_HP score. However, beta-2-agonist inhaler use and scores for Nocturnal_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and morning tightness were all significantly better in the BDP phase, and may have contributed to its better overall subjective performance. Thus, both NDS and BDP resulted in a significant improvement in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP control in the subjects studied, and both drugs caused a similar improvement in PEF.

However, beta-2-agonist inhaler use and scores for nocturnal asthma and morning tightness were all significantly better in the BDP phase, and may have contributed to its better overall subjective performance. Thus, both NDS and BDP resulted in a significant improvement in asthma control in the subjects studied, and both drugs caused a similar improvement in PEF.
[Study of the protective action of nedocromil sodium with bronchial cold-air provocation in children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].12 children with known bronchial hyperreactivity and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP had isocapnic cold air Hyperventilation_HP challenges of their bronchial airways. In a double-blind cross-over study they inhaled either placebo or nedocromil sodium (2 puffs à 2 mg) from a MDI before challenge. 2 subjects were found to be non-responders during the two days of the study. The remainder all reacted on the placebo days, while 5 subjects were completely protected on the nedocromil-days and 5 subjects were partially protected. Nedocromil is a potent agent for the suppression of bronchial hyperresponsiveness.

Pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of topical corticosteroid derivatives used for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP therapy.Although systemic corticosteroids provide additional therapeutic benefit for persons with Refractory_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, their side effects make them less than optimal agents. Introduction of beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP), the first corticosteroid that is clinically useful when delivered by aerosol, provided a major advance in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP therapy. Patients who were previously maintained on daily systemic steroids could be transferred to inhaled steroids with no loss of medical benefit and significant improvement in the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The value of BDP and subsequent topical corticosteroids lies in their pharmacologic properties. These agents possess increased intrinsic potency when administered by inhaler. At the same time they have considerably lower systemic potency than corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone and dexamethasone in aerosol form. This is because the fraction of the topically useful compounds that is swallowed, which is substantial, is rapidly inactivated by first-pass metabolism in the liver. Absorption of unmetabolized drug through the pulmonary circulation accounts for most of the systemic effect of topical corticosteroids. Use of spacers in the aerosol delivery device can further increase the efficacy of these substances, or allow lowering of the dose.

Effect of corticosteroids on airway hyperresponsiveness.Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP symptoms are linked to Chronic_HP inflammation in the airway. Corticosteroids reduce BHR and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP symptoms and, although their precise mode of action is not yet certain, it is likely that they suppress the allergic inflammatory response. They may act on macrophages, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and airway microvascular leak to inhibit the late response and BHR that follows allergen exposure, whereas Chronic_HP administration may also reduce the number of mast cells in airways to decrease the immediate response to allergen and exercise. In view of the safety of administration, inhaled corticosteroids should be considered as first line therapy for Chronic_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, with the aim of suppressing inflammation and reducing the need for bronchodilator therapy.

Use of topical corticosteroids in the treatment of childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Various aspects of topical corticosteroids in the treatment of childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP are reviewed: indications, application and bioavailability, dosing schedules, clinical efficacy, effects on non-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness, bronchial reactions after allergen challenge, and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, as well as possible side effects such as the influences on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis or growth and other potentially harmful actions. It was concluded that topical corticosteroids are very beneficial in the treatment of Moderate_HP-to-Severe_HP childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and that the risk of side effects can be neglected when the required doses for most patients are used.

Complications of topical steroid therapy for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The oropharyngeal complications of IS therapy are seldom a serious problem. They may be avoided or Ameliorated_by_HP inhaling the drug via a spacer and/or reducing the dosing Frequency_HP. Severe_HP esophageal candidiasis or atrophic Glossitis_HP are rare and generally require discontinuation of IS therapy. Reflex Cough_HP or Bronchospasm_HP Triggered_by_HP the inhaled drug occur fairly commonly, but are easily corrected by appropriate treatment. The systemic complications of IS therapy are inconsequential in most patients treated with conventional low doses. Higher doses are more effective but also more active systemically.

The potential risk of adverse systemic effects accruing from the long-term use of intermediate or high doses of IS needs to be rigorously studied.

Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of multiple doses of azelastine to adult patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP over time.Azelastine is a new oral antiAsthma_ASDPTO_HP agent with bronchodilating and antiallergic properties. This 12-wk study compared azelastine (2, 4, 6, and 8 mg) and placebo given twice a day in Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics 12 to 60 yr of age requiring daily bronchodilator therapy. Patients were allowed albuterol aerosol, short-acting theophylline, and pseudoephedrine only as needed. The study was completed by 221 Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic subjects. No significant differences in symptoms, medication, or pulmonary function existed between groups at baseline. Analysis of the zero hour FEV1 before azelastine administration on eight occasions during the 12 wk of therapy indicated an increasing slope for azelastine 6 mg that was statistically different from that of placebo; similarly, the slope for azelastine 4 mg showed the same trend, but it did not reach statistical significance. All azelastine groups had significant reductions of as-needed medication after 1 wk; only in the 4-mg and 6-mg groups was this reduction sustained for 12 wk. Asthma_ASDPTO_HP symptom scores and peak expiratory flow measurements remained Stable_HP in the azelastine groups despite significant reductions in concomitant medication administration. Side effects were minor and included: altered taste (30.1 to 51.9%), Drowsiness_HP (6.0 to 16.9%), and Xerostomia_HP (3.8 to 6.1%). The occurrence of these adverse events decreased with time throughout the study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Effects of sequential doses of parenteral terbutaline on plasma levels of potassium and related cardiopulmonary responses.beta-agonist bronchodilator drugs are known to cause Hypokalemia_HP; nevertheless, successive parenteral doses are recommended for the treatment of Status_asthmaticus_HP. The metabolic and cardiopulmonary effects of sequential, subcutaneous doses of terbutaline were studied in eight Stable_HP adult asthmatic patients. Each subject received terbutaline, 0.25 mg subcutaneously, followed 30 min later either by a second subcutaneous dose of terbutaline (sequential) or normal saline (single) in a randomized, double-blind, crossover fashion. Maximum reductions in plasma potassium from baseline were significantly greater (p less than 0.05) following sequential treatment compared to single treatment (-1.1 versus -0.6 mEq/L, respectively). Improvements in forced expiratory volume in 1 s were temporally related to changes in serum potassium and were significantly greater (p less than 0.01) following sequential terbutaline treatment. Prolongation of the QTc interval occurred following both treatment regimens. The change in QTc was statistically significant only following sequential treatment, increasing from 377 +/- 21 to 441 +/- 39 ms (p less than 0.05). Sequential doses of parenterally administered terbutaline result in clinically significant reductions in plasma potassium that are temporally related to changes in pulmonary function and associated with important electrocardiographic alterations.

Changes in airway resistance following nasal provocation.Controversy exists on whether stimulation of the nasal mucosa results in reflex bronchoconstriction. To address shortcomings in previous experimental design, we performed double-blind randomized nasal challenges in asthmatic patients with Allergic_Rhinitis_HP and in controls. Using pledgets containing 10-microliters aliquots of 0.9% saline or increasing concentrations of methacholine or histamine, we were able to increase nasal resistance significantly in both groups. Only methacholine caused an increase in lower airway resistance, and this could be blunted by premedication of the nasal mucosa with phenylephrine. This suggests that the effect on lower airway resistance was due to systemic absorption. Our study does not support the existence of a nasobronchial reflex from mechanical alteration of the nasal mucosa.

Peripheral_HP lung resistance in normal and asthmatic subjects.In Obstructive_lung_disease_HP, Peripheral_HP airways are a major site of pathologic abnormalities. However, resistance to airflow in small airways in the periphery of the lung accounts for only a small fraction of total airway resistance. Consequently, abnormalities of small airway function may not be readily detected using routine pulmonary function testing. In the present study, resistance of the Peripheral_HP lung was examined directly in six normal subjects and nine mildly asthmatic subjects. There were no significant differences between the normal and asthmatic groups in pulmonary function assessed by spirometry (FEV1, FVC) and body plethysmography (specific airway conductance). Direct measurements of Peripheral_HP lung function were made using a fiberoptic bronchoscope wedged into a subsegmental, Right_HP upper lobe bronchus. Using a double-lumen catheter inserted into the instrument channel of the bronchoscope, pressures (PB) produced by three or more different levels of gas flow (V) (5% CO2 in air) between 50 and 500 ml/min were measured. All pressure measurements were made at a constant lung volume (i.e., functional residual capacity) confirmed by monitoring transpulmonary pressure with an esophageal balloon. The pressure-flow relationship in both normal and asthmatic subjects could be approximated by a straight line through the origin, demonstrating these airways to be relatively nondistensible. Peripheral_HP lung resistance (Rp) was defined by PB/V and averaged for three or more levels of flow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Chronic_HP Cough_HP. The spectrum and Frequency_HP of causes, key components of the diagnostic evaluation, and outcome of specific therapy.A successful, systematic, anatomic, diagnostic protocol for evaluating patients with Chronic_HP Cough_HP was presented in 1981. To determine whether it was still valid, we prospectively evaluated, over a 22-month interval, 102 consecutive and unselected immunocompetent patients complaining of Cough_HP an average of 53 +/- 97 months (range, 3 wk to 50 yr). Utilizing the anatomic, diagnostic protocol modified to include Prolonged_HP esophageal pH monitoring (EPM), the causes of Cough_HP were determined in 101 of 102 (99%) patients, leading to specific therapy that was successful in 98%. Cough_HP was due to one condition in 73%, two in 23%, and three in 3%. Postnasal drip syndrome was a cause 41% of the time, Asthma_ASDPTO_HP 24%, Gastroesophageal_reflux_HP (GER) 21%, Chronic_HP Bronchitis_HP 5%, Bronchiectasis_HP 4%, and miscellaneous conditions 5%. Cough_HP was the sole presenting manifestation of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and GER 28 and 43% of the time, respectively. While history, physical examination, methacholine inhalational challenge (MIC), and EPM yielded the most Frequent_HP true positive results, MIC was falsely positive 22% of the time in predicting that Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was the cause of Cough_HP. Laboratory testing was particularly useful in ruling out suspected possibilities. We conclude that the anatomic diagnostic protocol is still valid and that it has well-defined strengths and limitations.

The neutrophil and Chronic_HP allergic inflammation. Immunochemical localization of neutrophil elastase.To test whether neutrophils infiltrate and degranulate in areas of Chronic_HP respiratory allergic inflammation, we developed an indirect immunofluorescence technique to localize neutrophil elastase in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. The affinity-purified antielastase stained only neutrophils on Peripheral_HP blood buffy coat smears, and in lung tissue from patients with Pneumonia_HP. We examined tissue specimens from four patients with fatal Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, 10 patients with Chronic_HP Sinusitis_HP, and 10 patients with Nasal_polyposis_HP for the presence of elastase, as well as eosinophil granule major basic protein (MBP). Neutrophil infiltration and extracellular elastase deposition in association with damage to respiratory epithelium were generally sparse in most specimens; the exceptions were one patient with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, one patient with Chronic_HP Sinusitis_HP, and two patients with Nasal_polyposis_HP. In contrast, eosinophil infiltration and extracellular MBP deposition were generally marked in most specimens; the exceptions were one patient with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and one patient with Nasal_polyposis_HP where extracellular MBP deposition did not coincide with damage to respiratory epithelium. The results suggest that the neutrophil does not usually infiltrate tissues showing allergic inflammation; however, on occasion, it may participate in these inflammatory reactions.

Mismatch between 99mTc-DTPA aerosol and 81mKr lung ventilation scintigraphy: a pitfall of radionuclide imaging.Pulmonary ventilation and perfusion scintigraphies were performed using 99mTc-MAA, 81mKr, and 99mTc-DTPA aerosol in a patient with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Lung perfusion scintigraphy and 99mTc-DTPA aerosol scintigraphy showed multiple matching defects, however, 81mKr ventilation scintigraphy showed mismatch with lung perfusion scintigraphy. A pitfall of this examination was discussed.

Inhalational challenge using hypertonic saline in asthmatic subjects: a comparison with responses to hyperpnoea, methacholine and water.Non-isotonic aerosols are being used increasingly for bronchial provocation testing in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. We investigated changes in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) in response to inhaling ultrasonically nebulized 4.5% saline in 10 normal subjects and 68 subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. A comparison of the sensitivity to this challenge was made with sensitivity to challenge with methacholine, water, exercise and eucapnic voluntary Hyperventilation_HP (EVH). In normal subjects the FEV1 was reduced by 6 +/- 2% (mean +/- SD) after inhalation of 33 ml of aerosol. Eighty four percent of the asthmatic subjects exhibited a fall in FEV1 of greater than 20% after inhaling 4.5% saline. The provoking dose (geometric mean +/- 95% confidence limits) of saline to induce a 20% fall (PD20) was 2.05 ml (1.34-4.48). The sensitivity to inhaled 4.5% saline was significantly related (p less than 0.001) with responsiveness to methacholine, exercise and EVH, but not to water. Those patients recording a PD20 to 4.5% saline had a PD20 to methacholine less than 2 mumol which is a response consistent with Moderate_HP to Severe_HP bronchial hyperresponsiveness.

High-dose inhaled versus intravenous salbutamol combined with theophylline in Severe_HP Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Swedish Society of Chest Medicine.In a multicentre parallel group study we studied 176 adult patients (53% men) with Severe_HP Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (peak expiratory flow (PEF), 15-50% of predicted values). The effect of two doses of inhaled salbutamol (0.15 mg.kg-1 x 2; 30 min apart) (n = 87) was compared with that of one dose of salbutamol given intravenously (5 micrograms.kg-1) (n = 89). There was a significantly larger increase in peak expiratory flow after the first inhaled dose in the group that received inhalation treatment than in the i.v. treated group (69 vs 41 l.min-1, p less than 0.05), but there was no difference in systemic side-effects between the groups. After the second inhaled dose there was a further increase in PEF, but also in systemic side-effects. These treatments were also compared in a cross-over study on 18 of the patients who returned with a second attack of Severe_HP Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The cross-over evaluation produced similar results, with a significantly larger increase in PEF after the first inhaled dose than after the i.v. treatment. Fifteen of the 18 patients found the inhalations more effective than the i.v. treatment. Theophylline (3-6 mg.kg-1) was infused i.v. 60 min after the start of salbutamol treatment, and a significant increase in PEF was observed in both groups. A correlation between the increase in PEF and the increase in plasma theophylline concentration was only found in the group that had received i.v. salbutamol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Efficacy of sustained release theophylline given at three different evening intake times in addition to a baseline medication.In this randomized crossover study of 26 outpatients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP the efficacy of a new once-daily theophylline formulation given in addition to a baseline medication was investigated; moreover, under steady state conditions, the effect of three evening intake times (6, 8 and 10 p.m.) on 24 h pharmacokinetics and peak-expiratory flow profiles was evaluated. The theophylline dose had been individually titrated. The pharmacodynamic results show a marked improvement of 24 h peak expiratory flow values after adding theophylline to a drug therapy including inhalative beta 2-agonists and corticosteroids in nearly all and inhalative anticholinergics in 50% of the treated outpatients. No significant differences between the pharmacokinetic characteristics and the 24 hr averages (mesors) of peak expiratory flow at the three different intake times 6, 8 and 10 p.m. were found; however, intake at 10 p.m. resulted in the highest Nocturnal_HP excess of serum theophylline concentrations and the highest peak expiratory flow during the early morning hours between 2 and 6 a.m.

Metal toxicity and the respiratory tract.The type of Abnormal_lung_morphology_HP caused by metal compounds depends on the nature of the offending agent, its physicochemical form, the dose, exposure conditions and host factors. The fumes or gaseous forms of several metals, e.g. cadmium (Cd), manganese (Mn), mercury (Hg), nickel carbonyl (Nl(CO)4, zinc chloride (ZnCl2), vanadium pentoxide (V2O5), may lead to Acute_HP chemical pneumonitis and Pulmonary_edema_HP or to Acute_HP tracheobronchitis. Metal fume Fever_HP, which may follow the inhalation of metal fumes e.g. zinc (Zn), copper (Cu) and many others, is a poorly understood influenza-like reaction, accompanied by an Acute_HP self-limiting neutrophil alveolitis. Chronic_HP obstructive Abnormal_lung_morphology_HP may result from occupational exposure to mineral dusts, including probably some metallic dusts, or from jobs involving the working of metal compounds, such as welding. Exposure to cadmium may lead to Emphysema_HP. Asthma_ASDPTO_HP may be caused by complex platinum salts, nickel, chromium or cobalt, presumably on the basis of allergic sensitization. The cause of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in aluminium workers is unknown. It is remarkable that Asthma_ASDPTO_HP induced by nickel (Ni) or chromium (Cr) is apparently inFrequent_HP, considering their potency and Frequent_HP involvement as dermal sensitizers. Metallic dusts deposited in the lung may give rise to Pulmonary_fibrosis_HP and functional impairment, depending on the fibrogenic potential of the agent and on poorly understood host factors. Inhalation of iron compounds causes siderosis, a pneumoconiosis with little or no fibrosis. Hard metal Abnormal_lung_morphology_HP is a fibrosis characterized by desquamative and giant cell Interstitial_pneumonitis_HP and is probably caused by cobalt, since a similar disease has been observed in workers exposed to cobalt in the absence of tungsten carbide. Chronic_HP beryllium disease is a fibrosis with sarcoid-like epitheloid granulomas and is presumably due to a cell-mediated immune response to beryllium. Such a mechanism may be responsible for the Pulmonary_fibrosis_HP occasionally found in subjects exposed to other metals e.g. aluminium (Al), titanium (Ti), rare earths. The proportion of Neoplasm_HP_of_the_lung_HP attributable to occupation is around 15%, with exposure to metals being Frequent_HPly incriminated. Underground mining of e.g. uranium or iron is associated with a high incidence of Neoplasm_HP_of_the_lung_HP, as a result of exposure to radon. At least some forms of arsenic, chromium and nickel are well established lung carcinogens in humans. There is also evidence for increased Neoplasm_HP_of_the_lung_HP mortality in cadmium workers and in iron or steel workers.

Does non-specific bronchial responsiveness indicate the Severity_HP of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP?It is difficult to analyse the relationship between bronchial responsiveness and the Severity_HP of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP since each alone is difficult to assess. Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is a Heterogeneous_HP condition with many patterns of expression, and clinical methods used to assess its Severity_HP have their limitations. Problems also arise in interpreting the results of bronchial provocation tests and methodological differences make comparisons between studies difficult. The findings of both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have shown a general relationship between the degree of responsiveness and the Severity_HP of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, but within subjects the relationship is weaker. A greater understanding must await increased knowledge of the mechanisms underlying Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and the contribution which hyperresponsiveness makes to each of these.

Sensitivity and specificity of PC20 and peak expiratory flow rate in cedar Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The Diagnosis_ASDPTO of red cedar Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is usually confirmed by a specific challenge with plicatic acid, the compound responsible for the disease. We performed this study to determine the sensitivity and specificity of two other diagnostic tests, Prolonged_HP recording expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and measurement of bronchial responsiveness (provocative dose of methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 [PC20 methacholine]). Twenty-three patients with suspected cedar Asthma_ASDPTO_HP participated in the study. The patients recorded PEFR during 2 weeks away from work and 3 weeks at work. PC20 was measured both at the end of the nonworking and working period. An obvious decrease in PEFR in 2 of 3 working weeks, when PEFRs of weekends or holidays were compared (by visual inspection of the PEFR recording), and a decrease in PC20 by more than a twofold dilution, when the patient returned to work, were considered as positive tests for cedar Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Plicatic acid challenge test was performed at the end of the study; 14 patients reacted, whereas nine patients did not. With the results of the plicatic acid challenge test as the gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity of PEFR recordings were 86% and 89%; changes in PC20, 62% and 78%; and 93% and 45% for a positive clinical history. The combination of PEFR and clinical history revealed a 100% sensitivity with a 45% specificity. Combination of PEFR and PC20 did not improve the diagnostic accuracy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Ambulatory long-term subcutaneous salbutamol infusion in Chronic_HP Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Although most patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP improve with currently available drugs, there appears to be a subset of patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP resistant to intensive treatment, including large doses of systemic corticosteroids. In 10 patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP difficult to treat, a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study was performed to evaluate whether long-term, continuous subcutaneous infusion of large doses of salbutamol, in addition to steroids, could improve pulmonary function, compared with Recurrent_HP nebulization of salbutamol. Four weeks of administration of large doses (greater than 14 mg/day) of beta 2-agonists were well tolerated, elicited a significant decrease of corticosteroid consumption (p less than 0.01), and were associated with an improvement in pulmonary function (p less than 0.01), compared with run in or the placebo administration period. Mean morning and evening peak expiratory flow rates were similar during all periods, and the variability between morning and evening peak expiratory flow rates was only slightly and nonsignificantly reduced during the period when salbutamol was administered subcutaneously. Both nebulized and subcutaneous salbutamol elicited similar metabolic and muscular side effects, but these untoward reactions never caused any patient to stop the treatment. Local infection at the injection site was observed in two of 10 patients with continuous subcutaneous infusion. Tachyphylaxis to beta 2-agonist, as measured by the reversibility of FEV1 to inhaled salbutamol 12 hours after the end of each period, did not occur. In conclusion, large doses of beta 2-agonist administered to patients with Severe_HP, Chronic_HP, and steroid-dependent Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were able to improve respiratory function and to decrease corticosteroids requirements.

Long-term, double-blind comparison of controlled-release albuterol versus sustained-release theophylline in adolescents and adults with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.This parallel-group study compared the safety and efficacy of controlled-release albuterol versus sustained-release theophylline, both administered every 12 hours. One hundred twenty-four adolescent and adult patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and with Chronic_HP reversible obstructive airway disease were studied. All patients qualified with an FEV1 less than or equal to 80% of predicted (not receiving treatment) and greater than or equal to 15% reversibility in FEV1 or greater than or equal to 25% reversibility in FEF25-75% after inhaled isoproterenol. All patients were known to be able to take theophylline without unacceptable adverse effects. Theophylline was titrated for patients to receive, unblinded, theophylline serum concentrations of 10 to 20 micrograms/ml. With subsequent randomization, 62 patients continued to receive theophylline and 62 patients started taking albuterol in the 12-week, double-blind, double-dummy portion of the study. Pulmonary function was measured during a pretreatment visit (unmedicated) and serial assessment was made starting just before the morning dose and continuing for 12 hours after the dose at the end of 1, 6, and 12 weeks of treatment. Both treatment groups exhibited statistically significant increases in FEV1 from the pretreatment visit to all times of observation at weeks 1, 6, and 12. The increases in FEV1 were not significantly different between albuterol and theophylline administration. There was no evidence of tolerance to the bronchodilatory effect during 12 weeks in either treatment group. Only one patient in the study stopped treatment because of an adverse effect. This patient had Tremor_HP during albuterol administration. All other adverse events were tolerated or resolved during treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

[Nocturnal_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in children, symptoms and treatment].Nocturnal_HP airflow obstruction is a common symptom in children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The increase in airflow obstruction overnight is underassessed by children as well as their parents. Worsening of the early morning peak flow values may be an indication for an increase in airflow obstruction overnight. An increase in vagal activity does not, in contrast with the observations in adult patients, contribute to the development of Nocturnal_HP airflow obstruction in asthmatic children. However, a Nocturnal_HP increase in inflammatory mediators seems to play a role of importance. Treatment of Nocturnal_HP airflow obstruction should therefore be focussed on inflammatory processes in the lungs.

[CARD from childhood to adulthood].In approximately 50 per cent of the children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP respiratory symptoms, these symptoms disappear during puberty. Outgrowing childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is especially estimated by: the degree of airway obstruction as a child, and the degree of bronchial hyperreactivity in childhood. Another childhood factor of influence on the prognosis of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP seems to be the combined early and late bronchial response after inhalation of an allergen. Factors not predicting the outcome of childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP are: at what age Asthma_ASDPTO_HP symptoms started; whether the child with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP had Eczema_HP or not, and how strong skin-Allergy_HP was. Conceivable risk-factors for the outcome of childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP are: Smoking_ASDPTO of the parents and a strong degree of Eosinophilia_HP. The prognosis of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP might be Ameliorated_by_HP more intensive treatment and continuity in treatment of the children with an increased risk.

Conceivable risk-factors for the outcome of childhood asthma are: smoking of the parents and a strong degree of eosinophilia. The prognosis of asthma might be improved by more intensive treatment and continuity in treatment of the children with an increased risk.
[Pulse oximetry in pediatric practice].Pulse oximetry is a reliable technique for continuous, transcutaneous measurement of oxygen saturation and pulse Frequency_HP. Common indications for pulse oximetry in general pediatrics include: monitoring of oxygenation during an Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attack, detection of Apnea_HP or Hypoventilation_HP, Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Hypoxemia_HP in patients with Chronic_HP Respiratory_insufficiency_HP and monitoring of oxygen suppletion. In this article we discuss the various applications and limitations of pulse oximetry in clinical practice and describe a method to store, analyse and present pulse oximeter-results.

Effect of ketanserin, a new blocking agent of the 5-HT2 receptor, on airway responsiveness in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Most of the antihypertensive drugs have a liability for adverse effects in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Since there are few available data on the effect of ketanserin, a new antihypertensive drug which is a type-2 serotonin receptor antagonist, on human respiratory function, we have tested whether this drug can modify bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine in asthmatic patients. The protective effect of intravenous ketanserin (0.14 mg/kg) was small, but significant.

The 1987 forest fire disaster in California: assessment of emergency room visits.During a 5-d period that commenced on August 30, 1987, dry lightning strikes ignited more than 1,500 fires that destroyed in excess of 600,000 acres of California forests. To evaluate the public health impact of the smoke on the general population, all hospital emergency rooms located in the six counties most severely Affected_HP by smoke or fire were surveyed. Selected hospital information was abstracted for a 2 1/2-wk period during the fires and during two reference periods. During the period of major forest fire activity, visits of persons with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP increased in number (observed/expected ratios of 1.4 and 1.3, respectively), as did visits of persons with Sinusitis_HP, upper Respiratory_tract_infection_HP, and laryngitis. A few patients with Acute_HP respiratory or eye irritation also visited the emergency rooms. Even recognizing the limited sensitivity of emergency room surveys, the overall public health impact was relatively modest. The increased respiratory morbidity detected in this survey, however, supports the notion that persons with pre-existing respiratory disease represent a sensitive subpopulation, who should be targeted for purposes of public health intervention when exposure to forest fire smoke is likely.

Corticosteroids in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The use of corticosteroids in the treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP has significantly decreased the morbidity and mortality from this disease. However, corticosteroids have devastating side effects when given frequently or for Prolonged_HP periods. High doses of systemic corticosteroid preparations should be used only during bouts of Acute_HP Bronchospasm_HP, whereas the lowest possible dose needed to control symptoms is recommended for the treatment of Chronic_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Aerosolized steroids offer an alternative to systemic preparations and have less associated morbidity. Various corticosteroid preparations have various potencies and durations of action that need to be considered. Patients with coexisting Abnormality_of_the_liver_HP require preparations that do not need hepatic hydroxylation, whereas patients with Congestive_heart_failure_HP require preparations that minimize salt retention. When Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and pregnancy coexist, it is vital that symptoms of Bronchospasm_HP are controlled to protect the fetus. During stressful situations, such as surgery, it is important to consider the possibility of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression if the asthmatic patient has been previously treated with corticosteroids.

[Peak flow monitoring of asthmatic patients. 1. Basis for measurement procedures and normal values].Peak flow monitoring (PEFM) consists of repeated measurements of the peak expiratory flow rate (PEF) frequently measured by means of small transportable peak flow metres which have proved sufficiently accurate for registration of alterations in PEF. In the majority of persons, not only asthmatics but also Healthy_HP individuals, characteristic Diurnal_HP variations in PEF are found. The variation amplitude is greatest in asthmatics. The scientific basis for the proposed norms and standards is incomplete but suggests that normal daily variations in PEF are less than 15-20%, calculated as the difference between the highest and lowest daily values as a percentage of the highest. At least 2-4 daily measurements should be made to obtain a reliable picture of the pattern of variation.

[Peak flow monitoring of patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. 2. Practical use].Despite its simplicity, peak flow monitoring (PEFM) has proved to be a valuable method of investigation of the degree of Severity_HP of bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and the effect of treatment and it has, therefore, been employed in a series of scientific investigations and testing of medicaments. On account of its simplicity, the method is suitable for outpatient monitoring of asthmatic patients in general practice and it can provide a valuable objective assessment of pulmonary function to supplement clinical assessment and the patient's symptoms. Employment of PEFM as a predictor of the short-term of long-term prognosis is good on a group basis but unsatisfactory in prediction of the prognosis for the individual patient. Although a series of sources of error are present, patients can achieve reliable results of measurements after meticulous instruction.

Respiratory_tract_infection_HP: their role in airway responsiveness and the pathogenesis of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The effects of RVIs on airway reactivity are multiple but do not necessarily include direct changes in the intrinsic contractile properties of airway smooth muscle. Rather, respiratory viruses influence bronchial smooth muscle function through a variety of other mechanisms: production of virus-specific IgE antibodies, epithelial injury, polymorphonuclear-dependent inflammation, and enhanced mediator release. Thus, a common pathway to airway hyper-reactivity during respiratory viral illnesses is an overall enhancement of factors that cause or lead to inflammation. When the airways become the target of enhanced inflammation, bronchial reactivity and obstruction are accentuated. Although many questions remain to be answered, future studies to evaluate the biology of respiratory virus effects on mechanisms of allergic sensitization and airway responsiveness promise to provide a greater understanding of the pathogenesis of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Relationship of different serum levels of theophylline on methacholine sensitivity.With an increased awareness of the importance of bronchial hyperreactivity on the clinical state of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, efforts at establishing effective treatment for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP have been aimed at trying to reduce the level of bronchial hyperreactivity. This study investigated whether or not theophylline at different serum concentrations had any effect on bronchial hyperreactivity, as measured by methacholine challenges. Twelve adult subjects with Mild_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP participated. All subjects were atopic and were nonsmokers. Subjects were studied on three separate occasions according to a double-blind, randomized, crossover study design with one of the following Medications_ASDPTO: two placebo capsules in the morning and evening, a placebo and 250 mg of sustained-release theophylline in the morning and evening, or two 250 mg sustained-release theophylline capsules each morning and evening. Subjects were administered their medication between 5 and 15 days before performing methacholine challenges in the morning at the presumed trough level, and in the afternoon at the presumed peak serum theophylline level. Despite statistically significant differences in the pulmonary function and theophylline levels between the two active dosages (p less than 0.05 for both), there was no difference in methacholine sensitivity at the time of ingestion of the two dosage forms. There was also no correlation between a particular theophylline level and degree of methacholine sensitivity. It was concluded that, although theophylline has significant bronchodilator capability, it has little, if any, effect on bronchial hyperreactivity, as measured by methacholine challenges. Thus, other forms of long-term therapy should be used in reducing bronchial hyperreactivity.

Comparative protective effect of the inhaled beta 2-agonist salbutamol (albuterol) on bronchoconstriction provoked by histamine, methacholine, and adenosine 5'-monophosphate in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.We have investigated the ability of salbutamol to protect against bronchoconstriction induced by methacholine, histamine, and adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) in nine subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, salbutamol, 2.5 mg administered by nebulization, increased the geometric mean provocation concentrations of methacholine, histamine, and AMP required to produce a 20% decrease in FEV1 from 0.3 to 2.2, 0.4 to 3.8, and 4.0 to 106.7 mg/ml after placebo and active treatment, respectively (p less than 0.01). Thus, this dose of beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist displaced the concentration-response curves for methacholine, histamine, and AMP to the Right_HP in a parallel fashion by 8.8 (0.6 to 29.3)-, 10.3 (1.4 to 33)-, and 26.6 (1.5 to 76.6)-fold, respectively, the difference between the results for AMP and those for histamine and methacholine being statistically significant (p less than 0.01). For six of the nine subjects studied, salbutamol displaced the concentration-response curve for AMP to the Right_HP by greater than 50-fold. There was no correlation between bronchodilatation and protection against bronchoconstriction induced by any of the agonists. We conclude that salbutamol protects against bronchoconstriction provoked by methacholine and histamine by functional antagonism, whereas with AMP, an additional activity is demonstrable, possibly involving inhibition of mast cell-mediator release.

Methylprednisolone pulse therapy in Status_asthmaticus_HP. A randomized, double-blind study.Methylprednisolone pulse therapy (MPPT) has been shown to possess a long-lasting effect in other immune-inflammatory diseases without the well-known side effects caused by long-term treatment with glucocorticosteroids. In an attempt to reduce the long-term use of oral steroids in asthmatics, we conducted this double-blind, double-dummy study to compare the use of MPPT (1 g of methylprednisolone intravenously) (8 patients) with a short course of oral prednisolone (10 patients) in asthmatics presenting with Status_asthmaticus_HP. Both treatments were effective in relieving the Acute_HP attack of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The MPPT-treated patients did not show a faster resolution than did the orally treated group. No patients needed assisted ventilation, and no deaths occurred. One week after the treatment FEV1 tended to decrease in the methylprednisolone group compared with the oral prednisolone group (P = 0.06). The patients initially receiving MPPT needed supplementary prednisolone earlier and in higher doses than did the patients receiving oral prednisolone as initial treatment. At the end of the 12 weeks' study period, the groups reached identical FEV1. In conclusion, we did not find intravenous methylprednisolone superior to oral prednisolone in the treatment of Acute_HP attacks of Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, but methylprednisolone pulse therapy had a shorter duration as regards protection against future Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attacks.

Basophil histamine release in the Diagnosis_ASDPTO of house dust mite and dander Allergy_HP of asthmatic children. Comparison between prick test, RAST, basophil histamine release and bronchial provocation.The aim of the study is to compare the glass fibre-based basophil histamine release test with skin test (Phazet), RAST (Phadebas) and bronchial provocation test in children with allergic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The study comprised 68 selected children with a case history of extrinsic allergic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP to danders (cat and dog) and house-dust mite. Skin prick test, RAST, and histamine release were performed in all children and the bronchial provocation test was used as a reference of "true allergic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP". A total of 81 allergen bronchial challenges were performed and 44 children experienced 49 positive provocations. In 2.9% (2/68) of the children histamine release could not be performed due to technical difficulties (low histamine release with anti-IgE). Concordances in the range 76-87% were observed with no significant difference between the tests. The highest concordance (87%) was found between histamine release and bronchial provocation test followed by skin prick test vs bronchial provocation (84%) and RAST vs bronchial provocation (80%). The sensitivity and specificity were calculated for each test. All tests showed sensitivities in the range 90-94% and no significant difference between them was observed. The specificity of histamine release, skin prick test, and RAST was 0.78, 0.69, and 0.63, respectively. The specificity of histamine release was better than RAST demonstrated by 95% confidence intervals. In conclusion, it was found that the histamine release test is a convenient diagnostic method and the study indicates a diagnostic value comparable to the common diagnostic methods in clinical Allergy_HP.

[Diagnosis_ASDPTO of lung function in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].Chronic_HP obstructive airway diseases have only slight demand on lung function diagnostics according to the number of methods and technical level. But we have the demand of a high rate of lung function, more than in all other lung diseases. The expiratory peak flow (PEF) seems to be a suitable parameter for daily control.

The effect of caffeine on exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.The effect of caffeine on exercise-induced bronchoconstriction was examined in ten patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Placebo and caffeine 3.5 mg/kg and 7 mg/kg were given two hours before exercise. Spirometry was taken at one and two hours following caffeine and at 5, 15, and 30 minutes following exercise. Caffeine significantly improved baseline FEV1 and prevented exercise-induced bronchoconstriction only at a dose of 7 mg/kg. Caffeine was well tolerated by the patients. These data suggest that only high doses of caffeine significantly prevent a postexercise drop in FEV1.

A genetic approach to the study of lung physiology: understanding biological variability in airway responsiveness.Genetic techniques are generally applicable to almost any trait or physiological process for which biological variability can be demonstrated. These methods have not commonly been applied to studies on lung pathophysiology, however. The aim of this commentary will be to introduce and discuss the potential application of genetic methods to research on the pathophysiology of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Recent efforts to identify genes that determine airway hyperresponsiveness in the genetically standardized inbred laboratory mouse will be reviewed. These experiments demonstrate how genetic background influences the expression of airway responsiveness to certain environmental stimuli and illustrate the application of selected genetic resources. A discussion follows on how these genetic models may potentially provide insight into Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and our understanding of the molecular physiology and genetic regulation of airway hyperreactivity to various stimuli.

Influence of inspiratory flow rate upon the effect of a Turbuhaler.The effect of a new breath actuated dry powder inhaler, the Turbuhaler, was found to be reduced at inhalations slower than 28 1/minute. This flow rate could be generated by virtually all children aged greater than or equal to 6 years, by 42 of 57 children less than 6 years (74%), and by six of 15 preschool children with Acute_HP wheeze (40%).

Airways obstructive diseases: pathogenetic mechanisms and natural histories of the disorders.There has been a long-standing controversy concerning the risk factors and pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the development of Chronic_HP airflow obstruction (CAO). This asthmatic constitution consisted of a predisposition to Allergy_HP, airways hyperresponsiveness, and possibly Eosinophilia_HP. Other investigators, however, regarded CAO as simply the late stage of Chronic_HP Bronchitis_HP. The term Chronic_HP Obstructive_lung_disease_HP (COLD) was developed to resolve what was largely a semantic difference. In subsequent years, the term Chronic_HP obstructive pulmonary disease (Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP) has come to be used more often than COLD to describe these patients. This article discusses the differences between these terms and defines the causes and risk factors associated with each.

Mucosal permeability and smooth muscle function in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The changes in airway structure that occur in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP are characteristic of a Chronic_HP inflammatory process that involves tissue covered by a mucosal surface. This article reviews the inflammatory process and presentation of evidence that structural changes seen in asthmatic airways are a result of this response. The contribution of the airway muscle and epithelium to the abnormal function of asthmatic airways is also reviewed.

Differences in airway responsiveness in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Chronic_HP airflow obstruction.In patients with Chronic_HP Obstructive_lung_disease_HP, it is difficult to distinguish clinically between Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, Chronic_HP Bronchitis_HP, and Emphysema_HP. This is due in part to the fact that the original definitions were not mutually exclusive. Diagnosis_ASDPTO has not been helped by the measurement of airway responsiveness to methacholine or histamine, since responsiveness seems to be increased as often in those with Chronic_HP airflow obstruction as in asthmatic patients.

Assessment of bronchial responsiveness as a guide to prognosis and therapy in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The Severity_HP of airway inflammation in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is best assessed by combining several tests of bronchial responsiveness. The prognostic significance of bronchial responsiveness is unknown, but indirect evidence suggests that those with Moderate_HP and Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP rarely remit spontaneously and permanently. Assessment of Severity_HP is crucial to the rational management of all patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Severity_HP can be used as a guide to both short- and long-term management.

The clinical value of pharmacologic bronchoprovocation challenge.Pharmacologic bronchoprovocation challenge (PBC) can be of considerable clinical value in patients in the pediatric age group and adults because bronchial hyperresponsiveness is present in virtually all symptomatic asthmatics and it can be accurately, reliably, and safely demonstrated by PBC. The principal, proven indication for performing PBC is to rule out or help rule in the diagnostic possibility of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP as the cause of any unexplained chest complaints in patients with normal or near normal spirometric values.

Management of the critically ill asthmatic patient.Status_asthmaticus_HP is a life-threatening condition characterized by rapid or inexorable progression of airflow obstruction that may lead to Respiratory_failure_HP. It must be distinguished from other causes of Dyspnea_HP with signs of airflow limitation, and therapy must then be directed at relief of Bronchospasm_HP and airway inflammation, with use of multiple pharmacologic agents. Patients require moment-to-moment assessment until airway disease reverses. During this early portion of their course, intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required. Successful management on the ventilator requires an understanding of underlying abnormalities of lung mechanics and the interaction of the lungs and circulation.

Outpatient management of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The current approach to Asthma_ASDPTO_HP treatment centers around the recognition that Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is primarily an inflammatory condition; airway hyperresponsiveness and Bronchospasm_HP are secondary phenomena. Anti-inflammatory treatments that produce sustained improvement in airway hyperresponsiveness (environmental control, cromolyn, inhaled and ingested corticosteroids) are the mainstay of treatment to keep symptoms and bronchodilator use to a minimum. Adequate control of Chronic_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP with clearly defined treatment goals, accompanied by early recognition and patient-initiated treatment of worsened Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, generally with inhaled/ingested corticosteroid, can successfully reduce the high morbidity and the low, but significant, mortality from this common condition.

Occupational obstructive disorders: nonspecific airways obstruction and occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Airways obstruction as a result of occupational exposure may be divided into two categories on the basis of whether or not occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is present. The first category, nonspecific airways obstruction, takes place in the absence of occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, and demonstrates only modest changes in airways responsiveness. The second category, occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, usually has a causal relationship to exposure, and demonstrates marked changes in airways responsiveness. These distinctions are of use in Diagnosis_ASDPTO, treatment, and disability assessment.

[Extrinsic-allergic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP--principles, Diagnosis_ASDPTO, therapy, danger of disability].In Germany approximately 5 per cent of the population suffer from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The disease is characterized by nonspecific airway hyperresponsiveness to various stimuli, leading to airways obstruction. In the majority of cases sensitizations to inhaled or food allergens are revealed by skin tests and/or in-vitro tests (RAST) ("extrinsic" Asthma_ASDPTO_HP). Due to an allergen-induced increase of non-specific airway hyperresponsiveness allergencontacts favor asthmatic symptoms after non-specific stimuli, such as cold air or exercise. Therefore diagnostic measures in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP should include allergic history and standard allergen skin tests in each case. Nonspecific stimuli often play a predominant role among the causes of Acute_HP airways obstruction, depending on the degree of nonspecific hyperresponsiveness. Other cases of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP are characterized by the absence of senzitizations ("intrinsic" Asthma_ASDPTO_HP). Usually, the symptomatology of these cases is more Severe_HP than in extrinsic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. In most cases of allergic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP prognosis is favourable, in contrast to Chronic_HP obstructive Bronchitis_HP and/or Emphysema_HP. The therapeutic approach consists of allergen avoidance and hyposensitization, if feasible, and of a combination of bronchodilating and antiinflammatory drugs. A number of work places has to be avoided. Drug treatment should aim at reducing airways hyperresponsiveness and absence of asthmatic symptoms, requiring (inhaled) steroids in most cases. Other therapeutic principles have to be considered, such as allergen avoidance, cessation of cigarette Smoking_ASDPTO, change of work place, choice of favourable climates during holidays, and hyposensitisation.

Childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP: a rational approach to treatment.Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is a common, but frequently underdiagnosed and undertreated, condition in childhood. In most children, the Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP can be made on the basis of history, physical examination, and simple investigations. Successful management of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is contingent upon both patient and parents having a clear understanding of the condition, the goals, and specific details of treatment. The majority of children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP can be managed by avoidance of provoking factors, and suppression of symptoms with drug therapy. Drug therapy should follow a logical scheme such that a child with Mild_HP, infrequent Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attacks would receive Recurrent_HP bronchodilator therapy, whereas a child with Severe_HP Chronic_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP would ultimately be treated with maintenance steroids. Response to therapy should be assessed by serial measurement of pulmonary function. Certain features peculiar to infantile Asthma_ASDPTO_HP demand a modified approach to the management of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in this age group.

[Ambulatory aerosol therapy in children with bronchial obstruction and hyperreactivity].Some of the main objectives for the use of aerosol therapy in the treatment of bronchial obstruction are pointed out. This has all been possible due to the physical findings on the use of aerosols, their mode of action, the size and speed of the particles, the level of bronchial obstruction ventilation and the technique behind it all. The main advancements in the treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP are described according to the degree of Severity_HP. Special attention is given to the great impact caused by the management of childhood lung obstruction. Bronchial obstruction; aerosol therapy; bronchial hyperreactivity.

Theophylline in the management of airflow obstruction. 2. Difficult drugs to use, few clinical indications.The narrow therapeutic index, potential toxicity, and need to monitor plasma concentrations make theophyllines difficult to use. Other drugs provide comparable or better bronchodilator and prophylactic efficacy. In Asthma_ASDPTO_HP theophyllines should be considered for Chronic_HP Stable_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP when treatment with optimal doses of inhaled steroids and bronchodilators fails to provide adequate control; for Nocturnal_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP; and for prophylaxis and relief of symptoms in children and adults when inhaled treatment cannot be given. In general, theophyllines cannot be recommended for Chronic_HP airflow obstruction. A trial of theophylline is reasonable in individual patients whose symptoms remain troublesome despite a trial of steroids and optimal doses of inhaled bronchodilators.

Dose-response relationship of inhaled metaproterenol sulfate in preschool children with Mild_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The dose-response relationship of single doses of nebulized metaproterenol sulfate 5% inhalant solution was evaluated by placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of 30 children, aged 3 to 6 years old, with Stable_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Total respiratory resistance, the primary variable used to assess response, was measured by the forced oscillation method for a period of 6 hours from the start of inhalation. When comparisons were made between metaproterenol sulfate and saline, only 0.01 and 0.02 mL/kg showed significant bronchodilation (P less than .05) in percent change from baseline and area under the curve. However, no significant differences were seen between these doses. Moreover, the effect was sustained for 3 hours with both higher doses. Minimal side effects were observed. Metaproterenol sulfate 5% inhalant solution at a dose of 0.01 mL/kg seems to be optimal to elicit significant and sustained bronchodilatory response in preschool children with Mild_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Hyperreactive site in the airway tree of Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients revealed by thickening of bronchial muscles. A morphometric study.Under the assumption that the more hyperreactive the bronchial muscles are, the greater their work hypertrophy, we analyzed the distribution of hypertrophic smooth muscles along airways to see where in the bronchial tree Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic constrictions mainly occur. Autopsy lungs from 16 patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, 13 with other Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HPs, and 20 controls were submitted to morphometry of the bronchial muscles. In microscopic slides, cross sections of airways were taken from the segmental bronchi to the terminal bronchioles. The perimeter length L of the basement membrane and the area S of muscles were measured, and the anatomic radius R and the muscular thickness D were calculated in a standardized circular state, in which the basement membrane was stretched into a circle without changing L or S. On bilogarithmic coordinates of D and R on which data from the Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics were pooled, it was shown that hypertrophy of muscles was the most pronounced in larger bronchi where constriction was most likely to occur. Closer analysis of patients, however, revealed that besides this typical pattern, which we designated Type I Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, there was a group of patients (Type II) in whom hypertrophy involved the entire range of airways, including the bronchioles, suggesting that the site of Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic response varies among patients. In nonAsthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients with Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP, only Mild_HP hypertrophy of muscles was found in the large airways, despite the presence of obstructive lesions mainly in the small airways.

[Mercury--is it a respiratory tract allergen?].Mercury is a well-known allergen in dermato-allergology, often manifesting as delayed type hypersensitivity contact Eczema_HP. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions (Urticaria_HP, Anaphylactic_Shock_HP) have also been described for this allergen, most frequently seen in patients with the delayed type contact Eczema_HP. To our knowledge this allergen has not been implicated in production of respiratory symptoms. We describe a patient who had aggravation of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP by mercury contained in dental amalgam. When the dental amalgam was removed there was a great improvement in his Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. This observation suggests that mercury in the form of dental amalgam may also be an allergen of the respiratory tract, which should not be surprising, bearing in mind the work that shows the existence of mercury vapours from dental amalgam.

Acute_HP bronchoconstriction is not a stimulus for sympatho-adrenal activation in asthmatic or Healthy_HP subjects.Bronchoconstriction has been found to cause little sympathoadrenal activation in asthmatic patients. It has been questioned whether this is due to blunted sympatho-adrenal reactivity in asthmatics or if bronchoconstriction is a stimulus for sympatho-adrenal activation at all. We therefore compared sympatho-adrenal responses in eight asthmatic patients and 12 Healthy_HP subjects by measurements of plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations before, during and after methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction. Significant bronchoconstriction was obtained in eight of the Healthy_HP subjects and in all of the asthmatics. Considerably higher concentrations of methacholine were required to evoke bronchoconstriction in the Healthy_HP subjects but the relative magnitudes of bronchoconstriction were similar in the two groups: peak expiratory flow (PEF) decreased by approximately 24 and approximately 28% and specific airway conductance (sGaw) decreased by approximately 68 and approximately 70% in asthmatics and controls, respectively). Methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction did not alter plasma catecholamine levels significantly in either group. In addition, plasma concentrations of catecholamines and neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity (NPY-LI) were measured before and during bronchoconstriction induced by histamine or allergen in 8 and 5 asthmatic subjects, respectively. Plasma noradrenaline, adrenaline and NPY-LI remained unchanged up to 30 min after bronchoconstriction induced by histamine or allergen. We, therefore, conclude that bronchoconstriction is not a stimulus for sympatho-adrenal activation and that the lack of an adrenaline response to bronchoconstriction is not likely to be related to NPY release.

The role of increased airway microvascular permeability and plasma exudation in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Airway Edema_HP and inflammation are recognized as cardinal features of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, resulting from increase microvascular permeability of the bronchial circulation with the exudation of plasma and inflammatory cells into the airway lumen. Resistance to airflow is increased and the epithelium is disrupted either directly or by cytotoxic proteins derived from migrating inflammatory cells. Such mediators include bradykinin, platelet-activating factor (PAF), leukotrienes and histamine. Antigen-induced and neurogenic inflammation, generated by immunoglobulin E (IgE) and neuropeptides respectively, may also contribute to Edema_HP generation. Assessment of increased bronchial vascular permeability in animals has largely involved measurement of the extravasation of radiolabelled albumin or protein-bound dyes. Non-invasive techniques are less reliable in humans, but measurement of the rate of clearance of inhaled particles labelled with isotope may prove successful. Airway Edema_HP appears to be an important feature of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and future research may be aimed at developing drugs that specifically prevent airway microvascular leakage.

[Recent findings in the pathogenesis of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].The latest discoveries about the pathogenesis of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP are reported with emphasis on new data concerning the discovery of factors capable of controlling the production of IgE antibodies. The mechanisms implicated in early and late phase reactions are then discussed. In addition, the relationships between neuropeptides and Chronic_HP inflammation are described. Finally, the role of active substances produced by the bronchial epithelium on the induction and maintenance of bronchial inflammation is reviewed.

Can the study of spontaneous drawings indicate those children with Chronic_HP illness?A controlled study of children's drawings as a means of detecting those with Chronic_HP disease, in the form of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, was carried out. The drawings produced by 48 children with Chronic_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and those of 52 controls were studied blindly and independently by three observers. One observer used a scoring method, the second used direct assessment, based on experience of children with Chronic_HP disease. The third observer based the assessment on knowledge and the use of drawings in clinical practice. The observer with a knowledge of drawings per se was clearly superior (p less than 0.001) in detecting those with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, while the other two observers' ability was no better than chance.

Lymphocytes and bronchial hyperresponsiveness.Non-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness can be defined as an increased responsiveness of the respiratory airways to physical, chemical and pharmacological stimuli. It is a characteristic feature of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Knowledge of the mechanisms contributing to bronchial hyperresponsiveness can provide an insight into the pathogenesis of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and could lead to an improved therapy. Several abnormalities have been postulated to underlie the hyperresponsiveness, such as a beta-adrenoceptor dysfunction, hyperreactivity of airway smooth muscle, epithelial dysfunction or damage, increased reflex bronchoconstriction, mucus plugging and mucosal Edema_HP. It is possible that more than one of these abnormalities or other, as yet unknown, mechanisms are involved. In contrast to the role of lymphocytes in the regulation of IgE antibody production, the role of these cells in bronchial hyperresponsiveness has received little attention. We review evidence indicating that lymphocytes are involved in the development of non-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness in some animal models and in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.
Lymphocytes and bronchial hyperresponsiveness.Non-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness can be defined as an increased responsiveness of the respiratory airways to physical, chemical and pharmacological stimuli. It is a characteristic feature of asthma. Knowledge of the mechanisms contributing to bronchial hyperresponsiveness can provide an insight into the pathogenesis of asthma and could lead to an improved therapy. Several abnormalities have been postulated to underlie the hyperresponsiveness, such as a beta-adrenoceptor dysfunction, hyperreactivity of airway smooth muscle, epithelial dysfunction or damage, increased reflex bronchoconstriction, mucus plugging and mucosal oedema. It is possible that more than one of these abnormalities or other, as yet unknown, mechanisms are involved. In contrast to the role of lymphocytes in the regulation of IgE antibody production, the role of these cells in bronchial hyperresponsiveness has received little attention. We review evidence indicating that lymphocytes are involved in the development of non-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness in some animal models and in patients with asthma.
In vivo evaluation of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid in atopic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, Chronic_Bronchitis_HP and sarcoidosis patients.The Severity_HP of inflammatory response was evaluated in skin test on guinea pig using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid obtained from patients with some diseases of the respiratory tract. The results of skin test were verified with activities of proteases in BAL fluid. The study was performed on 24 patients with atopic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, 21 with Chronic_Bronchitis_HP, 13 with sarcoidosis (II phase) and 18 control subjects. All patients were undergoing fiberoptic bronchoscopies and BAL fluid was obtained. The results of skin test on guinea pig using BAL fluid were correlated with the activities of acid and neutral proteases. The highest activity of proteases and Severity_HP of skin reactions were noted in patients with atopic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and sarcoidosis. Authors suggest that the skin test on guinea pig with BAL fluid may be useful tool for total evaluation of inflammatory response in patients with atopic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, Chronic_Bronchitis_HP and sarcoidosis.

Treatment of Acute_HP, Episodic_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in preschool children using Recurrent_HP high dose inhaled steroids at home.In a double blind, controlled trial, the effect of high dose beclomethasone dipropionate (750 micrograms three times daily for five days) administered by metered dose inhaler and valved spacer, was compared with placebo, during 70 paired episodes of Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in 24 preschool children. Treatment commenced at home at the first sign of an attack. Parents' blind preference for active treatment was significant. Data from 17 pairs of treatment, however, were Affected_HP by interventions such as hospital admission or oral corticosteroid treatment. These events occurred similarly in active and control periods. An intrasubject comparison was made of diary scores from the 18 pairs of episodes in which no intervention occurred in either the active or placebo treatment. Both daytime and night symptoms over the first week of the attack were significantly reduced by active treatment. Recurrent_HP high dose inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate is beneficial in modifying the Severity_HP of Acute_HP Episodic_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in preschool children able to use a spacer device.

[Bronchial hyperreactivity or broncho obstructive hyper response].In this article bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR) is defined and a series of factors which may be involved are discussed: genetic, neurovegetative Postural_instability_HP, increase in the bronchial epithelial permeability, inflammation and mechanical factors which cause the shortening of the bronchial smooth muscle. A less rigid bronchial cartilage and a decrease in pulmonary elasticity, as well as a thickening of the bronchial wall due to a relative hypertrophy of the glandular tissue might just explain the occurrence of bronchial hyperreactivity in breast-feeding newborns, which actively wheeze and later outgrow the abnormality, and those cases of persistent BHR who repeatedly wheeze. This hyperbronchial response reappears with the aging of the lung tissue.

Effect of ketotifen on childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP: a double-blind study.Ketotifen was administered orally, for 3 months, to 40 children aged 3-14 years with Chronic_HP extrinsic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP of Moderate_HP Severity_HP in a double-blind placebo-controlled study. A significant clinical improvement with concomitant reduction of antiasthmatic drugs was found in the group receiving the active drug compared with the placebo group (p less than 0.05). The continued administration of ketotifen in an open study to a group of 21 children comprised of patients belonging to both groups (active-placebo) for a period of 15-18 months resulted in disappearance of symptoms in 10 children (47.6%) and Moderate_HP improvement in 7 (33.3%).

Bronchial hyperresponsiveness in two populations of South Australian rural schoolchildren.This report describes the cross-sectional analyses of the results obtained from the first year of a longitudinal study designed to investigate the natural history of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in association with reported respiratory symptoms in children attending the Burra and Kingston Community Schools. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine was measured using a modified Yan technique. Prevalence rates of respiratory symptoms were obtained using the Tasmanian Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Foundation Questionnaire. Considerable overlap of reported symptoms of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and/or wheezy breathing and Bronchitis_HP and/or loose and Productive_Cough_HP was observed suggesting that a clear distinction between such symptoms in childhood may not be possible. Analyses of data showed the prevalence of reactive airways in children to be 21.3% in Burra and 22.0% in Kingston. These values were the same as results obtained from an earlier pilot study in Burra and similar to results from Wagga Wagga (19.6%) and Auckland (20.1%) but higher than from Belmont (15.5%) and Villawood (15.3%). Increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness was associated with the reporting of symptoms of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and/or wheezy breathing (odds ratio, 5.04; 95% confidence interval, 2.18-11.74) and Bronchitis_HP and/or loose and Productive_Cough_HP (odds ratio, 2.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-5.13), at any time in the child's life. Of children with no reported symptoms 10% also had demonstrable bronchial hyperresponsiveness.

[Sleep_disturbance_HP from the internist's viewpoint].Sleep disorders are common and can be caused by somatic diseases. Chronic_HP_Pain_ASDPTO_HP as well as heart and lung conditions are able to interfere with the normal sleep pattern. Obstructive_sleep_Apnea_HP is caused by a deranged Central_HP control of breathing occurring during sleep and leads to a sleep-fragmentation and consequently to daytime hypersomnolence. A problem oriented meticulous history can give valuable insights and distinct diagnostic considerations form the basis for an eventually successful therapeutic approach. Polysomnography is done in particularly puzzling cases and for evaluation of invasive therapeutic measures.

[The xanthines: status in the therapeutic arsenal in 1990].Methylxanthines are at present widely prescribed for obstructive airway-diseases. However, the exact therapeutic role of these drugs is not clear in 1990. In this short review, we discuss what we think to be a rational use of xanthines in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and in Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP patients: shortly speaking, we propose that the drugs are not first-line therapeutic tools and should be only prescribed in selected situations.

Methacholine airway responsiveness decreases during exercise in asthmatic subjects.In many asthmatic subjects, bronchoconstriction develops 2 to 5 min after exercise, reaches a maximum at approximately 10 min, and declines over the next 60 min. However, bronchodilation is typically observed during and immediately after exercise. We measured the bronchoconstrictor responses to increasing concentrations of inhaled methacholine at rest and during two levels of exercise in seven asthmatic subjects to determine the protection against bronchoconstriction afforded by exercise. On the first day, an incremental Stage 1 exercise test was performed to determine the work capacity (Wcap) of each subject. On the second, third, and fourth days, methacholine was inhaled at rest or during steady-state exercise at one-third or two-thirds of Wcap. The bronchoconstrictor response to methacholine was significantly reduced during exercise (p less than 0.0001). The concentration of methacholine required to produce a 20% reduction in FEV1 (PC20) increased from 2.80 mg/ml (%SEM, 1.62) at rest to 7.29 mg/ml (%SEM, 1.43) during exercise at one-third Wcap, and to 31.03 mg/ml (%SEM, 1.74) during exercise at two-thirds Wcap (p less than 0.001). This study has demonstrated that there is greater than tenfold protection against bronchoconstriction by methacholine during exercise, and the magnitude of the protection depends on the Severity_HP of exercise performed. The mechanism of this protection is not known, but may have clinical utility.

Effect of 15-(s)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid on allergen-induced asthmatic responses.15-(s)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE), a major oxidative metabolite of arachidonic acid in human lungs, has complex actions on the 5-lipoxygenase pathway in different cell systems. We have examined the effect of inhaled 15-HETE on the early and late asthmatic responses (EAR and LAR) and the associated change in nonspecific bronchial responsiveness to inhaled allergen in 10 subjects with atopic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. On 2 separate days 3 wk apart, subjects inhaled either 70 nmol 15-HETE or the diluent (sodium phosphate buffer) in a randomized and double-blind fashion, followed by a dose of allergen that had previously been shown to produce a 25% fall in baseline FEV1. Analysis of the area under the FEV1 response time course curves (AUC) in the first hour revealed that preinhalation with 15-HETE increased the EAR by 39% from that achieved after the diluent (p less than 0.05). In the seven subjects who were classified as dual responders by developing a LAR previously (greater than 15% fall in baseline FEV1 3 to 8 h after allergen challenge), 15-HETE did not cause any significant change in the magnitude of the LAR when compared with that observed after placebo. The values of the provocation concentration of histamine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (Pc20) at 8 h postchallenge were significantly reduced on both study days when compared with the corresponding preallergen challenge values, whether analyzed for the whole group or for the seven dual responders (p less than 0.05). 15-HETE had no effect on this allergen-acquired airway hyperresponsiveness to histamine when compared with the diluent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

It is never certain what is the primary event. Better understood are the effects of the mediators. At the anatomic level, the following are always found: hyperplasia of smooth muscle, inflammatory infiltration by polynuclear eosinophils and glandular hypertrophy with hypersecretion. Immunology will be considered separately.

[Clinical Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].Paroxysmal Wheezing_HP Dyspnea_HP, Asthma_ASDPTO_HP may evolve from a simple crisis to an asthmatic attack that repeats several crises daily with duration up to several weeks, in some months when the asthmatic illness becomes life-threatening. Chronology of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is related to bronchial inflammation without knowing how to avoid the development of complications. Childhood types and those of subjects of more than 65 years are well characterised by mechanisms of bronchial hyper-reactivity that are always found and are identical to the type found in young adults. There are "limited" types that need respiratory function tests for confirmation of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

[The etiologies of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].Asthma_ASDPTO_HP may have several etiologies. It is well-known that there are allergic subjects with low IgE bound to mast cells, with negative specific RAST and with weakly positive skin tests, but with a positive provocation test with pneumo-allergens. Food_Allergy_HP, isolated or associated is also not a negligible cause. Non-allergic subjects often respond to triggering factors: Gastro-oesophageal reflux Neuro-endocrine origin Infectious origin Physical origin (exercise). In our study, we place the emphasis on two types of extremely Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, linked to intolerance of aspirin and metabisulphites and often associated.

Variations of airway responsiveness to methacholine and exercise in asthmatic and normal subjects over a 12-month period.This study looked at seasonal fluctuations of airway responsiveness (AR) to methacholine and exercise in ten Mild_HP asthmatic and seven normal subjects. Each subject had a monthly methacholine inhalation test. An exercise challenge with measurement of expiratory flows was performed initially in the fall (F), then in winter (W), and in summer (S). Throughout the study, the subjects were asked to record on a diary card twice daily peak flow rates and respiratory symptoms, one week a month. Airway responsiveness to exercise and methacholine remained generally Stable_HP throughout the year, although an increase in respiratory symptoms occurred during fall and winter. The overall AR to methacholine was not significantly different during the different seasons (F, W, S and Spring) with the methacholine concentration producing a 20% fall in FEV1, PC20 (mg/ml) values, respectively, of 1.7 +/- 1.2 mg/ml, 1.8 +/- 1.1, 2.1 +/- 1.2, and 2.0 +/- 1.9 for asthmatics and 79.0 +/- 1.2 mg/ml, 66.8 +/- 1.0, 87.3 +/- 1.0, and 73.1 +/- 1.0 for normals. However, short term variations in AR were associated to exposure to antigens and cold weather. Mean daily peak expiratory flows remained generally Stable_HP through the seasons. On the three exercise tests, the VO2 max and the mean % fall in FEV1 after maximal exercise showed large variations; these, however, were not significantly different (mean fall: 16.2% (F), 16.6% (W), and 14.7% (S) in asthmatics). In conclusion, although it may increase transiently, overall airway responsiveness to methacholine and exercise remains generally Stable_HP in asthmatic and normal subjects throughout the year.

The effect of an inhaled leukotriene antagonist, L-648,051, on early and late asthmatic reactions and subsequent increase in airway responsiveness in man.We have investigated the protective effects of the inhaled cysteinyl leukotriene antagonist, L-648,051, on allergen-induced early asthmatic response (EAR) and late asthmatic response (LAR) and the subsequent changes in bronchial responsiveness to methacholine. Ten atopic men with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP participated in a double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled trial. All subjects had documented EAR and LAR to house dust-mite extract. Responsiveness to methacholine was measured the day before and the day after a standardized allergen-challenge test. L-648,051 was inhaled in two doses of 12 mg 20 minutes before and 3 hours after the allergen challenge. The response was obtained from FEV1 and flows from maximal (V40m) and partial (V40p) expiratory flow-volume curves. All subjects had an EAR and LAR during placebo therapy, but only a minority demonstrated an increase in methacholine responsiveness of more than one doubling dose. The ratio of V40m to V40p during methacholine challenge was higher than during both EAR and LAR (p less than 0.05). There was no difference between drug- and placebo-therapy periods in baseline function, EAR, LAR, ratio of V40m to V40p, and the allergen-induced hyperresponsiveness (p greater than 0.1). These results indicate that an effective aerosolized leukotriene antagonist in man does not protect against allergen-induced airflow obstruction, despite the evidence of an inflammatory response to allergen challenge. This suggests that either the potency or duration of activity of L-648,051 is limited or that leukotrienes C4 and D4 do not play a causative role in human allergic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

The ratio of V40m to V40p during methacholine challenge was higher than during both EAR and LAR (p less than 0.05). There was no difference between drug- and placebo-therapy periods in baseline function, EAR, LAR, ratio of V40m to V40p, and the allergen-induced hyperresponsiveness (p greater than 0.1). These results indicate that an effective aerosolized leukotriene antagonist in man does not protect against allergen-induced airflow obstruction, despite the evidence of an inflammatory response to allergen challenge. This suggests that either the potency or duration of activity of L-648,051 is limited or that leukotrienes C4 and D4 do not play a causative role in human allergic asthma.
[Thromboxane A2 could be involved in bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine in asthmatic subjects but not in bronchitic subjects].To determine whether the involvement of thromboxane A2 in bronchial hyperresponsiveness is specific to Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, we examined the effects of a selective thromboxane synthetase inhibitor (OKY-046) and a cyclooxygenase inhibitor (indomethacin) on bronchial responsiveness to methacholine in patients with bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Chronic_Bronchitis_HP. The provocative concentration of methacholine producing a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (PC20-FEV1) was measured before and after oral administration of OKY-046 and indomethacin in eight asthmatic and 10 bronchitic subjects. Baseline FEV1 value was not altered by OKY-046 or indomethacin. The geometric mean value of PC20-FEV1 increased significantly (p less than 0.005) from 1.78 to 4.27 mg/ml after OKY-046 in asthmatic subjects, but not in bronchitic subjects. On the other hand, PC20-FEV1 was not altered by indomethacin in all subjects. It was concluded that the involvement of thromboxane A2 in bronchial hyperresponsiveness may be specific to Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

The risk of nitrogen dioxide: what have we learned from epidemiological and clinical studies?Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is an oxidant gas which contaminates ambient air in many urban and industrial locations, and indoor air in homes with combustion appliances. The Environmental Protection Agency presently regulates NO2 in ambient air as a "criteria" pollutant. In spite of decades of laboratory, clinical, and epidemiological research, the health effects of NO2 exposure on humans are not well understood. The toxicological evidence suggests that increased Recurrent_infections_HP, functional deficits from effects on airways, and deterioration of the status of persons with Chronic_HP respiratory conditions, including asthmatics, are of potential concern. This paper provides a perspective on the present evidence related to human health effects of NO2. It addresses methodological barriers that limit the available data; assesses the adequacy of the data for risk assessment; and proposes a research agenda to obtain needed information on the health effects of NO2.

Comparison of a multi-allergen dipstick IgE assay to skin-prick test and RAST.A multi-allergen dipstick enzyme immunoassay 'Quidel Allergy_HP Screen' (QAS) has recently been developed commercially for measuring IgE antibodies against nine allergens (house dust 1, house dust 2, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, D. farinae, Japanese cedar, ragweed, cat dander, sweet vernal grass, and egg white) at one time. To assess whether this assay is useful in screening allergen-specific IgE antibody, we compared the titres of IgE antibodies against the nine allergens measured by QAS to those in the skin-prick test and by RAST in 93 atopic asthmatics and 22 normal subjects. We found a good overall agreement between the results of the skin-prick test and the results of QAS (sensitivity = 47.1-81.4%, specificity = 84.5-100%, and agreement = 78.9-88.9%). The sensitivities against house dust 1, D. pteronyssinus, and D. farinae ranged from 77.2 to 81.4%. However, the sensitivities against house dust 2, Japanese cedar, ragweed, and cat dander were low (47.1-68.8%). We also found a good overall agreement between the results of RAST and the results of QAS, except for egg white (sensitivity = 46.2-94.4%, specificity = 87.4-100%, and agreement = 77.4-96.5%). The sensitivities against house dust 1 and 2, D. pteronyssinus, D. farinae, and Japanese cedar ranged from 86.0 to 94.4%. The sensitivities against ragweed, cat dander, and sweet vernal grass were low (46.2-52.6%). There were strong correlations between the titres of RAST and the titres of QAS except cat dander and egg white (r = 0.701-0.924 for the seven allergens). Thus, we conclude that QAS is useful in screening IgE antibodies against multiple allergens at one time. However, because the sensitivities against some allergens tested were low, further improvement of some allergen preparations seems to be necessary in the assay.

The relationship between atopy and non-specific bronchial responsiveness.Atopy is often regarded as a risk factor for the development of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, particularly childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. This could reflect an association with non-specific bronchial responsiveness (NSBR), though atopy could influence Asthma_ASDPTO_HP independently. We have evaluated the possible relationship between atopy and NSBR (PD20FEV1 to methacholine) in the siblings of 59 probands with atopic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Thirty-four (58%) were atopic (greater than or equal to 1 prick test with weal diameter greater than or equal to that of a 0.1% histamine control) and 28 (47%) showed NSBR. Atopy and NSBR occurred together more frequently than would be expected by chance (P less than 0.05); both variables being observed in 20 subjects, neither in 17, and only one in 22. A significant association was also noted when atopy was defined by a serum total IgE greater than 150 IU (or greater than 50 IU), but when atopy was defined by other commonly used criteria (greater than or equal to 2 prick tests with weal diameter greater than or equal to histamine control; or weal diameter 2 mm or more greater than a saline control), no significant association was demonstrated. Furthermore, linear logistic regression and multiple regression analyses showed that both the presence and the degree of NSBR were influenced much more by the baseline level of FEV1 than by atopic status. At best, atopy accounted for 10% of the variance of the PD20 measurements. We conclude that atopy is associated with NSBR but not strongly; that the relationship may be readily obscured according to the defining criteria used for atopy; and that atopy should not be used as a marker for NSBR.

Pattern of airway response to allergen extract of Phleum pratensis in asthmatic patients during and outside the pollen season.In order to evaluate the pattern of airway response to a specific bronchial provocative test (sBPT) with an extract of Phleum pratensis standardized in biological units (BU), we studied 27 patients with seasonal Asthma_ASDPTO_HP due to grass pollen by means of allergologic evaluations, methacholine inhalation test and sBPT, outside the pollen season in all patients and, in 10 of them, also during the pollen season. We used a DeVilbiss 646 nebulizer with a dosimeter, giving increasing doses (0.01-2.5 BU) of the allergen solution and we monitored FEV1 to assess early (EAR) and late (LAR) airway responses. Outside the pollen season sBPT elicited an isolated EAR in 16 and a dual asthmatic response (DAR) in 11 patients. We observed no significant difference between EAR and DAR patients as regards the provocative dose causing a 15% fall in FEV1 (PD15FEV1) methacholine, EAR (expressed by PD15FEV1 allergen) or allergologic data. There was a significant relationship between PD15FEV1 allergen and PD15FEV1 methacholine (r = 0.43, p less than 0.05). The reproducibility of sBPT was assessed in 11 patients outside the pollen season. The correlation coefficients between the two tests were: r = 0.91, p less than 0.001 for the total delivered dose of allergen during sBPT; r = 0.79, p less than 0.01 for PD15FEV1 allergen; r = 0.95, p less than 0.001 for the maximum percent fall in FEV1 during LAR. Ten patients repeated all tests during the grass pollen season. PD15FEV1 methacholine and baseline FEV1 decreased significantly during the pollen season, but PD15FEV1 allergen did not change significantly during the season.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Management of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Chronic_HP airflow limitation. Are methylxanthines obsolete?After almost 50 years as first-line drugs in the management of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP, methylxanthines have been largely superceded by inhaled adrenoceptor agonist and anticholinergic bronchodilators which are more potent and far less toxic. Accumulating evidence indicates that intravenous theophylline contributes side effects, but is rarely of benefit in Acute_HP exacerbations of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP or Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP. In the maintenance therapy of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, first-line therapy is dose-optimized inhaled steroids, reducing the need for bronchodilators. Inhaled adrenoceptor agonists are second line Medications_ASDPTO, anticholinergic aerosols third line, and theophylline, if needed at all, may fulfill a minor systemic steroid-sparing function in Severe_HP asthmatics on maximum doses of the inhaled Medications_ASDPTO. In the maintenance therapy of some patients with Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP, theophylline sometimes may be useful but these responders should be identified by objectively establishing therapeutic benefit. Since many patients have side effects from the methylxanthines, while their therapeutic benefit over and above dose-optimized inhaled therapy is marginal, their continued almost routine use in the management of reversible airflow obstruction is hard to justify, although this class of drugs may be useful in selected patients in whom both subjective and objective benefit can be demonstrated. In Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP, theophylline may improve exercise capacity in some patients by still incompletely understood mechanisms probably unrelated to bronchodilation.

Effect of live attenuated, cold recombinant (CR) influenza virus vaccines on pulmonary function in Healthy_HP and asthmatic adults.The effects of intranasal inoculation with live attenuated, CR influenza virus vaccines on pulmonary function in Healthy_HP and asthmatic adults were evaluated in placebo-controlled, double-blind studies. In 46 Healthy_HP adult volunteers, there were no statistically significant alterations in pulmonary function as measured by spirometry and histamine bronchoprovocation tests in the first week following monovalent CR influenza virus vaccine [type A (H3N2, H1N1) and type B]. Among Healthy_HP adults with pre-inoculation PC20s less than 10 mg ml-1, 8/12 were infected following Vaccination_ASDPTO but no significant alterations occurred in histamine bronchoprovocation. In 11 asthmatic adults, no statistically significant alterations in pulmonary function, as measured by spirometry, were noted during the first 7 days postinoculation with bivalent CR influenza virus vaccine type A (H3N2 and H1N1). Postinoculation respiratory illnesses were more common in CR influenza virus vaccine recipients than placebo recipients, but they were Mild_HP, consisting of afebrile Pharyngitis_HP and Transient_HP Rhinorrhea_HP. Attenuated CR influenza virus vaccines do not appear to impair pulmonary function during the first week following immunization of Healthy_HP and asthmatic adults.

[Glucocorticoids in asthmatic crisis in children].Systemic corticosteroids are misused in children with Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Their misuse is one of the factors responsible for the recent increase in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP mortality. Since 1980, 10 of 12 double blind randomized clinical trials have shown the beneficial effects of corticosteroids in Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP incompletely responsive to bronchodilatators.

Evaluation of Wheezing_HP in the nonAsthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patient.Wheezing_HP is a nonspecific manifestation of airway obstruction. Even though Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is the most common cause of Wheezing_HP, a variety of pulmonary and nonpulmonary conditions can present with this symptom. In recent years methacholine provocation challenge has simplified detection of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP; however, establishing accurate Diagnosis_ASDPTO of other causes of Wheezing_HP is important because each condition requires specific treatment. This article describes a methodical approach to the Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Wheezing_HP in patients who are not Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic.

[Effect of nitrogen dioxide on exercise-induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and the sensitivity of the respiratory tract to methacholine].In patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, airway hyperreactivity may be further increased by exposure to low concentrations of nitrogen dioxide. We studied the effect of inhaled nitrogen dioxide in 11 patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP who presented with normal lung function values. On two different days, 20 min tidal breathing of either filtered air or 0.25 ppm nitrogen dioxide was followed by bicycle exercise (average minute ventilation 30 l/min). One hour after the end of exercise, we performed a methacholine provocation challenge and determined PC100SRaw. The methacholine provocation challenge was repeated on another day (control day). Mean (SEM) SRaw increased by 79.8 (23.8) % and 82.4 (24.9) % after breathing of filtered air and nitrogen dioxide during exercise, respectively (n.s.). Mean (SEM) PC100SRaw was 0.409 (0.205), 0.407 (0.201) and 0.455 (0.181) mg/ml after breathing of filtered air, nitrogen dioxide and on the control day, respectively (n.s.). We conclude that in Mild_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics short-term exposure to 0.25 ppm nitrogen dioxide does not enhance airway responsiveness to exercise or methacholine.

[General environmental pollutants: effect on at-risk groups].A number of epidemiologic studies have emphasized the relationship between air pollution and the Frequency_HP of respiratory symptoms in patients with underlying airway diseases. On the basis of Acute_HP controlled exposure studies, SO2 causes Transient_HP airflow obstruction in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, but not necessarily in patients with Bronchitis_HP or lung fibrosis. The photochemical oxidants (ozone, NO2) induce an increase in airway responsiveness, ozone being of greater potential hazard than NO2.

[New occupational inhaled pollutants].New information about occupation-relative inhalative injuries, are reflected in the "Bill on the Modifications of the Regulations Governing Occupational Disease" of 22. 03. 1988; thus, for example, (benign) diseases of the pleura due to asbestos dust (No. 4103 and 4104), malignant neoplasias of the airways and lungs induced by nickel (No. 4109), and cooking plant gas (No. 4110), adenocarcinomas of the nasal sinuses, induced by oak and beech wood dust (No. 4203), exogenous allergic alveolitis, also those induced by other than agricultural dusts (No. 4201) (3) have all undergone modification. Current occupationalmedical problems represented in more detail include the hairdressers' Asthma_ASDPTO_HP induced by hair bleaching agents, bronchopulmonary diseases induced by cooling and lubricating agents, "metal fume Fever_HP", Asthma_ASDPTO_HP induced by enzyme dusts, flour and baking additives, bronchopulmonary and systemic diseases induced by acid anhydrides and isocynates.

[Indications for artificial ventilation in Status_asthmaticus_HP, adult Respiratory_distress_HP syndrome and Pneumonia_HP].Mechanical ventilation is indicated in Acute_HP Respiratory_failure_HP, especially in so-called pump failure as occurs in Status_asthmaticus_HP, Pneumonia_HP and ARDS due to respiratory Increased_muscle_fatiguability_HP. Using clinical parameters (inspiratory paradox, respiratory alternans), together with blood gas analysis and chest X-ray morphology, the indication can be established on a rational basis. The aims of therapy are tissue oxygenation and cure of the underlying disease which has led to Respiratory_failure_HP. By adapting ventilator settings to the respiratory mechanics of the individual patient, complication due to barotrauma can be avoided. Respiratory muscle rest can be assessed by monitoring tracheal pressure time curves. Unconventional methods using very small t idal volumes and very high Frequency_HP so far have no clearcut indications, as they are still investigational.

[Methodologic comparison of the polyFrequency_HP oscillation method, transcutaneous oxygen pressure measurement and body plethysmography in bronchial provocation with methacholine].A bronchial provocation challenge test was conducted with 30 subjects using metacholin. In randomised sequence lung function analysis tests were carried out with the bodyplethysmograph (Raw, FEV1) and the polyfrequent oscillation method (resistance, reactance between 2 and 52 Hz), whereas the transcutaneous oxygen pressure (tc-PO2) was measured continuously. Correlations between the various parameters, the change of the values at PD60 sGaw in relation to the initial values, the interindividual variability and the reactivity were determined. Medium correlations were found for the oscillatory parameters and Raw, whereas for tc-PO2 and Raw the correlation was markedly lower. In terms of percentage the greatest change was found in reactance, in relation to the initial value, followed by Raw and FEV1. The interindividual variability resulted in the highest values for the reactance, followed by Raw and FEV1. Interindividual variability showed the highest values for the reactance before oscillatory resistance and Raw. In respect of reactivity, reactance also had the highest values. Overall evaluation showed that bodyplethysmography and the polyfrequent oscillation method (reactance or resonance Frequency_HP) are comparably sensitive.

Open study of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of Severe_HP symptomatic or corticosteroid-dependent Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.To examine the possible usefulness of the immunomodulating antiinflammatory drug, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), in the treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, we studied the response of 11 asthmatics, four Severe_HP symptomatic nonsteroid dependent and seven steroid-dependent, in an open label 28 week trial at doses of 300 to 400 mg/d. Evaluation measures included daily symptom diary scores of six symptoms, subjective global evaluation, spirometric flow studies, and cumulative monthly steroid dosages. Baseline plasma theophylline and IgE levels were also obtained and compared with values during treatment. For the group as whole, mean FVC and FEV1 increased 10% and 17% respectively (P less than .01) and the mean of each of six symptom scores declined significantly (P less than .05). Among the nonsteroid-dependent asthmatics, the mean FVC and FEV1 rose 19% and 32% respectively (P less than .05) and mean symptom scores for five of six symptoms declined from baseline (P less than .05). Among the steroid-dependent patients, cumulative mean monthly steroid dosage required decreased 50% from 383 mg at entry to 191 mg at week 28 (P less than .01), mean FVC and FEV1 increased by 7% and 9%, although neither of these changes achieved significance, and two of six symptom scores improved (P less than .05). Comparison of pretreatment IgE levels to levels during treatment in ten patients demonstrated a fall from a mean of 645 to 339 IU/mL (P less than .05). Adverse reactions to HCQ were infrequent and did not require discontinuing therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Treatment of steroid-induced Osteopenia_HP with calcitonin in corticosteroid-dependent Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. A one-year follow-up study.Sixty-two steroid-dependent asthmatics who had not received any form of treatment to prevent bone loss were studied during a 12-month period. Patients were randomly divided into two groups. Thirty-one patients were treated with 1 g of elemental calcium taken daily plus 100 IU of salmon calcitonin every other day, administered subcutaneously; the remaining 31 patients received only calcium supplementation. In the calcitonin group, 11 patients dropped out of the study because of Severe_HP side effects (seven patients), lack of compliance (three patients), and exacerbation of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (one patient). The 20 patients who completed the 12-month follow-up period were analyzed and compared with 20 sex-matched patients from the control group. At one year, bone mineral density (BMD) had increased in the calcitonin group by a mean of 4% (p less than or equal to 0.001), whereas in the control group BMD had decreased by 2.5% (p less than or equal to 0.05). Parameters of bone remodeling (alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin) decreased significantly in the calcitonin-treated group but not in the control group. Our findings show that calcitonin 100 IU, given three times/wk, is an effective drug in the treatment of steroid-induced Osteopenia_HP. Side effects, however, are Frequent_HP and cause a high degree of dropout from therapy. These findings suggest that further studies should be carried out with lower doses of calcitonin or by other better tolerated forms of delivery such as in a nasal spray.

Elevated levels of leukotriene C4 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from atopic asthmatics after endobronchial allergen challenge.Sulfidopeptide leukotrienes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP because of their ability to induce Bronchospasm_HP, airways hyperreactivity, and increased mucus production. In the present study, the leukotrienes (LT) C4, D4, and E4 were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) before and 5 min after endobronchial allergen challenge in four subject groups: nonatopic nonasthmatic, nonatopic asthmatic, atopic nonasthmatic, and atopic asthmatic. As determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), after allergen challenge, the predominant sulfidopeptide leukotriene found in BALF from atopic asthmatics was LTC4. Smaller amounts of LTD4 and LTE4 were detectable. The baseline level of leukotrienes in the atopic asthmatics was 64 +/- 18 pg/ml, with measurable levels being found in nine of 11 samples. Atopic nonasthmatics had measurable levels in only one of seven baseline samples, whereas five of six nonatopic subjects had undetectable levels. Allergen challenge in atopic asthmatics resulted in significant increases in LTC4 over prechallenge levels (64 +/- 18 to 616 +/- 193 pg/ml) (p less than 0.01) and over levels in the three control groups after challenge (p = 0.0297). The atopic nonasthmatic group also had detectable leukotriene levels after allergen challenge (88 +/- 32 pg/ml), whereas leukotrienes remained undetectable in five of the six nonatopic samples. For comparison, histamine and the prostanoids prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) and thromboxane B2 (TxB2) were also measured in BALF. The levels of all three of these mediators increased in BALF from atopic asthmatics after allergen challenge. After allergen challenge, the best correlation was found between the levels in BALF for the prostanoids PGD2 and TxB2 (r = 0.88).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Twenty-four hour lung function in adult patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Chronoptimized theophylline therapy once-daily dosing in the evening versus conventional twice-daily dosing.Many patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP experience a worsening of symptoms at night and in the early morning, resulting in sleep disruption and possibly altered daily performance. A bronchodilator agent that exerts its maximal effect overnight to control Nocturnal_HP symptoms, without a worsening of the disease during the daytime, should improve the treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. This investigation examined the efficacy and kinetics of a new chronotherapeutically optimized, sustained-release theophylline formulation administered once daily (OD) in the evening at 8:00 P.M. in comparison with a conventional sustained-release theophylline administered twice daily (TD) at 8:00 A.M. and at 8:00 P.M. in the same dose. After a theophylline clearance study to substantiate normal or slow metabolism of the drug, a dose-titration period, and a 24-h baseline spirometric study of patients not receiving any medication, participants were randomized to 7-day treatment phases with either OD or TD. Each outpatient segment of 6 days of OD and TD was followed by a 24-h inpatient study on Day 7 when serum drug level and spirometric (PEF, FEV1, and FEF25-75) parameters were obtained every 2 h. The conventional TD treatment was associated with a constant serum theophylline level over the 24 h. In contrast, the OD treatment was associated with larger peak-to-trough drug level fluctuation, with higher levels produced overnight and lower ones in the evening at the end of the dosing interval. Compared with the baseline references, both OD and TD significantly improved airflow over the entire 24 h and to a comparable extent. However, between 2:00 and 6:00 A.M., PEF and FEV1 were significantly greater with OD than with TD. The improvement in PEF and FEV1 at this time, because of OD, was correlated with the serum theophylline level. This was not the case for TD. The improvement in airflow over baseline values between 2:00 and 6:00 P.M. was not correlated with theophylline level with either treatment regime. Overall, the chronotherapeutically conceptualized OD treatment administered in the evening resulted in better airflow levels overnight than did the TD regime without loss of airflow in the afternoon.

Inflammatory cells and eosinophilic activity in asthmatics investigated by bronchoalveolar lavage. The effects of antiasthmatic treatment with budesonide or terbutaline.We investigated the constituents of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) regarding cell profiles and released eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP) in 11 patients treated occasionally with inhaled bronchodilators (Group A) and 11 patients treated regularly with inhaled corticosteroids (Group B). A normal, Healthy_HP control group of 12 subjects was also recruited. Compared with Group A, Group B had a reduced recovery percentage of infused volume (p less than 0.05) and total cell number (p less than 0.01). Compared with the control group, there was a significant increase in the percentage of eosinophils (p less than 0.05) in both groups of asthmatics. In Group A there was also a significant increase in mast cells (p less than 0.05), serum-ECP (p less than 0.05), and BAL-ECP (p less than 0.001). No correlations between any of the cell variables and the level of airway responsiveness measured as PC20 histamine were found in any group. Group A patients were investigated twice--before and after 4 wk of randomly allocated treatment with either a regular beta-2-receptor agonist (terbutaline 250 micrograms, two puffs four times a day) or a regularly inhaled corticosteroid (budesonide 200 micrograms twice a day). The BAL differential cell counts were similar and not significantly Affected_HP by either treatment. However, BAL-ECP levels were decreased by budesonide treatment (p less than 0.05). ECP levels in serum and BAL were significantly correlated (p less than 0.05 to 0.001). The eosinophilic cell involvement in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is further emphasized by this study but the increase in numbers of eosinophils seems less important than their activity, here measured as release of one degranulation product, ECP. To suppress disease activity, repeated long-term treatment is important, but clear preference for either treatment cannot be given on the basis of our present results.

Observations on heaves. An Asthma_ASDPTO_HP-like syndrome in the horse. 1964.Observations in six horses with heaves established a clear relationship between attacks of heaves and the feeding of hay. Severe_HP Acute_HP attacks were accompanied by striking changes in the eosinophil count and the sedimentation rate. The variation in the Severity_HP of heaves in relation to the feeding and withholding of hay is accounted for by assuming that attacks result from a Transient_HP, obstructive lesion in the bronchial tree or lung caused by hypersensitivity to some component of hay. The observations strongly suggest that heaves is a respiratory allergic disease in the horse. The relation of heaves to Emphysema_HP in the horse is discussed.

Correspondence between forced oscillation and body plethysmography during bronchoprovocation with carbachol in children.We compared dose-response curves obtained with the forced oscillation technique (FOT) and with body plethysmography during bronchoprovocation in children. In 40 Stable_HP asthmatic children (age, 5-16 yr) we performed challenges with doubling concentrations of inhaled carbachol (0.15-10 mg/mL) until specific airway resistance SRaw had increased by 100% (PC100SRaw). The FOT-response was assessed by total respiratory system resistance (Rrs, cmH2O.1(-1).s) and reactance (Xrs, cmH2O.1(-1).s) from 8 to 26 Hz, expressed as mean Rrs (Rrs), mean Xrs (Xrs), Rrs at 8 Hz (Rrs8), and mean slope of Rrs (dRrs/df). Dose-response curves were analyzed for threshold concentrations (TC) causing a 3 SD change from baseline and sensitivity indices (SI) defined as differences between baseline and postchallenge values (at PC100SRaw) divided by baseline SD. Median TC of Rrs8, Rrs, Xrs, dRrs/df, and SRaw was 0.21, 0.30, 0.34, 0.41, and 0.42 mg/mL, respectively, indicating a slightly higher sensitivity for FOT. Median SI values of SRaw and Xrs (12.0 and 8.2; difference n.s.) were significantly higher than those of the other parameters. Multiple regression analysis revealed only the absolute change of Xrs (delta Xrs), baseline Rrs and age as significantly (P less than 0.001) correlated with the percentage change of SRaw (delta %SRaw). Best correlation (r = 0.86) with delta %SRaw was found for the function: FOT score = -102.5 X delta Xrs X exp(-0.196 X Rrs + 0.038 X age). Provocative concentrations estimated by this FOT score differed from PC100SRaw by less than one (two) concentration steps in 34 (40) out of 40 children.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Asthma_ASDPTO_HP: a disorder of adrenergic receptors?For the past 20 years, the hypothesis that bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP represents an Postural_instability_HP between deficient activity of the beta-adrenergic receptor pathway and/or enhanced activity of alpha-adrenergic/muscarinic cholinergic pathways in the regulation of airway smooth muscle has been a popular idea. Although some evidence supports this hypothesis, direct proof of its validity has been elusive. Concepts regarding the pathobiology of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP have shifted from a focus on changes in smooth muscle per se to the prominent inflammatory nature of this disorder. We review some of the evolving information regarding the pathogenesis of this disorder and discuss how altered neurohormonal regulation of key inflammatory cells may contribute to the asthmatic condition.

Venous blood platelets decrease during allergen-induced asthmatic reactions.To determine whether circulating platelets alter during asthmatic reactions induced by allergens, we studied nine subjects previously shown to develop an early or dual asthmatic reaction after inhalation challenge with extracts of house dust mite or grass pollen. In each subject, FEV1, circulating platelets and leucocytes were measured before, 15, 30 and 60 min, and 2, 4, 6 and 8 hr after inhalation of allergen and diluent control administered in a single-blind, randomized fashion. The same procedure was repeated in six of the nine subjects after bronchoconstriction induced by methacholine. Each subject developed an early asthmatic reaction after allergen inhalation challenge, which was followed by a late asthmatic reaction in six subjects and by an equivocal late asthmatic reaction in two of them (fall in FEV1 of 15 and 17% respectively). Compared with the control day, circulating platelets significantly decreased during the allergen-induced early asthmatic reaction (P less than 0.025, at 30 min). Platelet counts returned to baseline values within 4 hr and remained steady thereafter both in subjects who did and did not develop a late asthmatic reaction. No changes in platelet counts occurred after bronchoconstriction induced by methacholine. Diurnal_HP increase of leucocyte numbers occurred after challenge with both allergen and diluent control. These results suggest that platelets may be involved in the pathogenesis of allergen-induced asthmatic reactions.
Venous blood platelets decrease during allergen-induced asthmatic reactions.To determine whether circulating platelets alter during asthmatic reactions induced by allergens, we studied nine subjects previously shown to develop an early or dual asthmatic reaction after inhalation challenge with extracts of house dust mite or grass pollen. In each subject, FEV1, circulating platelets and leucocytes were measured before, 15, 30 and 60 min, and 2, 4, 6 and 8 hr after inhalation of allergen and diluent control administered in a single-blind, randomized fashion.

Choline magnesium trisalicylate in patients with Aspirin-induced_Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Treatment of inflammatory diseases of asthmatics can be a serious problem since some patients show intolerance to aspirin and other non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs that are cyclooxygenase inhibitors. Salicylates were believed to be well tolerated, but recent reports have demonstrated that diflunisal and salicylsalicylic acid can precipitate Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attacks in aspirin-intolerant patients. This study was designed to determine the tolerance of choline magnesium trisalicylate (CMT), a nonacetylated salicylate with potent analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity, in 23 asthmatics with aspirin hypersensitivity confirmed by oral challenge. The study consisted of three phases: 1) patients received increasing doses (50-1,500 mg) of CMT under a single-blind protocol; 2) patients received either a placebo or CMT challenge in a double-blind, randomized, cross-over design; 3) patients received CMT at daily 3,000 mg doses for 1 week. Throughout the study, pulmonary function tests, peak nasal inspiratory flow, and serum salicylate and thromboxane B2 (TXB2) levels were monitored. Results showed no airway obstruction, Nasal_obstruction_HP or Rhinorrhea_HP after CMT. There was no significant decrease in serum TXB2 levels, indicating the absence of cyclooxygenase inhibition with CMT. We conclude that choline magnesium trisalicylate is a safe drug for treatment of different anti-inflammatory disorders in asthmatics with aspirin hypersensitivity.

Mechanisms of hyperinflation in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.We studied 11 Mild_HP asthmatics to verify whether the mechanisms of hyperinflation in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP could be inhibited or overcome by passively changing lung volumes. On day 1, we induced a fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 30-60% by methacholine inhalation and measured the resulting increase in FRC (delta FRC). The delta FRC was 729 +/- 378 ml (mean +/- SD). On day 2, with the subject supine in an iron lung, we measured oesophageal (Poes), gastric (Pgas) and transdiaphragmatic (Pdi) pressures, and changes in functional residual capacity (FRC) (delta V) induced by extrathoracic pressures from -20 to +20 cmH2O before and after bronchoprovocation. With positive pressures, the FRC decreased and reached a plateau at 10 cmH2O pressure or higher. This plateau was at a mean FRC of 839 ml higher after the bronchoprovocation than before. Pdi at FRC varied in the same direction as the extrathoracic pressure and was not modified by the Bronchospasm_HP. Peak inspiratory Pdi, without pressure applied in the iron lung, increased from 13.6 +/- 5.4 to 28.1 +/- 13.5 cmH2O after methacholine; extrathoracic pressure of -20 cmH2O decreased this latter value to 15.4 +/- 7.3 cmH2O (p less than 0.01). The increased lung volume and the displaced chest wall recoil curve after provocation were not inhibited by positive or negative extrathoracic pressures. Our data show that the mechanisms of hyperinflation are not eliminated or overcome by passively changing lung volumes and support the hypothesis that persisting activity of inspiratory muscles other than the diaphragm during expiration and perhaps a Prolonged_HP expiratory time constant are responsible for hyperinflation in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Comparative effects of volume history on bronchoconstriction induced by Hyperventilation_HP and methacholine in asthmatic subjects.The aim of this study was to find out if bronchodilatation following deep inspiration can be induced by the inhalation of a "natural" stimulus (Hyperventilation_HP of cold dry air), and if the effect is similar to that induced by methacholine. After baseline assessment of lung resistance (RL), 10 asthmatic subjects were asked to inhale cold dry air for 3 min. RL was monitored continuously for 3-4 min, at which time subjects were asked to take a fast deep inspiration. After recovery, the manoeuvre was repeated and RL was reassessed. The manoeuvre was then repeated a third time. After functional recovery, Progressive_HP doses of methacholine were inhaled until the increase in RL was comparable to that obtained after Hyperventilation_HP (56 +/- 16% and 65 +/- 24%, respectively, mean +/- SD, NS). The same deep inspiration manoeuvre was repeated three times with recovery as after Hyperventilation_HP of cold dry air. Maximum changes in RL were not significantly different after each of the three manoeuvres for either type of bronchoconstriction. The mean fall in RL was 14.2 +/- 9.9% after Hyperventilation_HP and 16.4 +/- 10.5% after methacholine. There was a satisfactory correlation (r = 0.80, p less than 0.01) between the bronchodilatation after deep inspiration for both types of stimuli. We conclude that the bronchodilator effect of deep inspiration is no different using either a pharmacological stimulus (methacholine) or a "natural" stimulus (Hyperventilation_HP of unconditioned air). These results show that assessing the response to Hyperventilation_HP with manoeuvres requiring deep inspiration, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) may alter airway tone in a way similar to pharmacological stimuli.

Inhibition of adenosine 5'-monophosphate- and methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP by inhaled frusemide.Recent studies have shown that inhaled frusemide exerts a protective effect against various bronchoconstrictor stimuli in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP including exercise, fog and allergen. Since mast cell activation seems to be a component of bronchoconstriction by these stimuli it is possible that inhibition of mediator release accounts for some or all of the inhibitory effects of frusemide in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Since inhaled adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is another stimulus that produces bronchoconstriction by augmenting mast cell mediator release, we have investigated the ability of this drug to antagonise the airway effects of inhaled AMP and methacholine in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of 12 asthmatic subjects. Inhaled frusemide (approximately 28 mg) administered 5 min prior to challenge increased the provocation concentration of inhaled AMP and methacholine required to reduce forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV) by 20% from baseline from 30 to 96 mg.ml-1 (p less than 0.01) and from 1.1 to 1.8 mg.ml-1 (p less than 0.01), respectively. The protection that frusemide afforded against AMP was significantly greater than that against methacholine (p less than 0.05). These data suggest that inhaled frusemide may serve as a functional antagonist against a smooth muscle spasmogen, such as methacholine, possibly by augmenting prostanoid generation. Its more potent activity against AMP and other bronchoconstrictor stimuli, that are considered to involve mast cell mediators, suggests an additional action on mast cell functions possibly at the level of the Ca++/Mg(++)-ATPase.

The airways effects of inhaled chlorbutol in asthmatic subjects.Chlorbutol is an antibacterial and antifungal agent incorporated in terbutaline (Bricanyl) nebulizer solution. Ten Stable_HP atopic asthmatic subjects undertook bronchial challenge testing, according to a double-blind protocol. Patients inhaled doubling concentrations of either methacholine (0.13-4.0 mg.ml-1) or chlorbutol (0.16-5.0 mg.ml-1) for 2 min until the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) had fallen by 20% from baseline. If this had not occurred following the administration of the final concentration, then this highest concentration was repeated for 4 min. The nine subjects completing the study had a geometric mean provocation concentration producing a 20% fall from baseline FEV1 (PC20) methacholine of 0.16 mg.ml-1 (range less than 0.125-0.475 mg.ml-1). After inhalation of 2.5 mg.ml-1 chlorbutol one subject experienced a fall in FEV1 greater than 20%. In the remaining eight subjects, inhalation of chlorbutol did not Affect_ASDPTO airway calibre. We conclude that chlorbutol, in the concentration present in Bricanyl nebulizer solution, has no clinically significant effect on airway calibre.

Mucosal inflammation in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Over the past decade, it has become increasingly recognized that airways inflammation is one of the major components of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Until recently, measurements of bronchial responsiveness and mediators of allergic reactions were the only methods of studying pathogenetic mechanisms in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. With improved diagnostic procedures such as fiberoptic bronchoscopy, it has become possible to investigate these mechanisms and the resulting inflammatory changes in situ. BAL has highlighted the presence of mast cells and eosinophils and has given proof of their mediator participation in airways inflammation and hyperresponsiveness. Endobronchial biopsies have so far yielded results that are similar to those obtained from postmortem studies, although it appears that there are varying degrees of inflammation in living asthmatics. Even in Mild_HP disease, the histopathologic features of bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP are consistent with Chronic_HP inflammation. Indirect evidence obtained from allergen challenge leading to increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness during LAR, and direct evidence of inflammatory cells and their mediators in the airway mucosa and lumen after allergen challenge argue for an active role of cells in bringing about inflammatory changes. At present, however, it is not possible to relate precisely the findings obtained by bronchoscopy to the clinical presentation and progression of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Cell activation with production of potent mediators of inflammation may be more relevant to inflammation than the simple presence of these cells in the airways. Almost all the inflammatory cells present in the bronchial wall and lumen have been implicated in the pathogenesis of mucosal inflammation in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, but with our current state of knowledge, none can be singled out as the most important contributor. The mast cell was the first to be investigated in depth, and despite the accumulation of large amounts of data concerning its ultrastructure and function, it remains uncertain to what extent this cell is involved in inflammatory responses. Thus, while its main role appears to be that of initiator of allergen-induced responses, the eosinophil has attracted more attention as a proinflammatory cell rather than as an antiinflammatory cell with a capacity to be selectively recruited from the circulation in response to IgE-dependent signals. The eosinophil secretes potent mediators that cause damage to the bronchial epithelium and lead to bronchoconstriction. The role of other cells is at present not as well defined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

A randomized trial to improve self-management practices of adults with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The prevalence and impact of adult Asthma_ASDPTO_HP are substantial, and poor self-management practices, especially failures to adhere to treatment regimens, appear to be a significant problem. Desirable characteristics of an intervention program to improve self-management were identified through needs assessment and review of existing patient education resources. A comprehensive program was developed that integrated a workbook with one-to-one counseling and adherence-enhancing strategies. A longitudinal 1-year study compared patients receiving this self-management program with "usual care" patients receiving standard Asthma_ASDPTO_HP pamphlets. Patients were randomly assigned to conditions. Baseline score and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Severity_HP were statistically controlled. Self-management patients had substantially better adherence than usual care patients, as well as improved functional status, at follow-up. Hospital and emergency department visits decreased in both groups but did not differ between groups.

Measurement of peptidoleukotrienes in biological fluids.Samples of human bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and urine were utilized to demonstrate methods for quantitation and validation of leukotrienes (LTs). These methods utilize an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) that uses commercially available reagents, the antibody recognizing LTC4, LTD4, LTE4, and N-acetyl LTE4. BALF containing epithelial lining fluid was collected from atopic asthmatics both before and 5 min after the subjects had been challenged with a local instillation of allergen into the airways. BALF samples collected without allergen challenge had low levels of immunoreactive LTs, whereas samples collected after allergen were markedly elevated. After high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation of LTs, EIA revealed the presence of LTC4. The identity was validated by incubating LTC4 with a bovine gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase with dipeptidase activity that converted added [3H]-LTC4 as well as LTC4 immunoreactivity to LTE4. Urine samples collected from six Healthy_HP volunteers, one patient with adult Respiratory_distress_HP syndrome (ARDS), and three patients in Status_asthmaticus_HP were also analyzed for LTs. After HPLC separation of LTs and quantitation by EIA, urine samples from Healthy_HP subjects were found to have low but measurable LTE4. In contrast, the urine samples from the patients in Status_asthmaticus_HP and from the ARDS patient had large elevations of LTE4 levels compared with Healthy_HP subjects. When the HPLC fractions containing [3H]LTE4 and LT immunoreactivity in the ARDS sample were treated with acetic anhydride, HPLC analysis indicated that both radiolabel and immunoreactivity now eluted at the retention time of N-acetyl LTE4, the derivatized product of LTE4. The methods described are relatively easy and can be used to measure and validate the existence of peptidoleukotrienes in biological samples.

Methylprednisolone therapy for Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in infants and toddlers: a controlled clinical trial.A controlled double-blind trial was carried out to assess the effect of the early introduction of combined corticosteroid and beta-adrenergic drugs for the treatment of Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in infants and toddlers. Seventy-four emergency room patients (aged 7 to 54 months) who were treated for Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were studied. Treatment included, in addition to salbutamol inhalations, a single dose of intramuscular methylprednisolone (4 mg/kg) or normal saline as placebo. The patients were reevaluated 3 hours after initiation of treatment. At that time, patients were either admitted or discharged based on a clinical decision. Only 8 (20%) of 39 patients treated with steroids were admitted, compared with 15 (43%) of 35 in the placebo group (P less than .05). Sequential analysis of 33 pairs, matched by age and Severity_HP of symptoms, revealed statistically significant reduced admission rates in patients treated with steroids. In the younger patients (6 to 24 months), admission rate was significantly lower for those treated with steroids (18%) as compared with those treated without steroids (50%) (P less than .05). In the older group (24 to 54 months), the trend was similar but not statistically significant: 23% vs 31% in the steroid and placebo groups, respectively. These data indicate that corticosteroid treatment combined with an adrenergic agent, given early during an Acute_HP asthmatic episode, significantly reduces the hospital admission rate of infants and toddlers.

The interrelationship among bronchial hyperresponsiveness, the Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP symptoms.Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) to inhaled histamine has often been cited as the gold standard in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Diagnosis_ASDPTO, but recently this has been questioned. This report assesses the relationship of BHR to Asthma_ASDPTO_HP symptoms and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Diagnosis_ASDPTO in a large community-based sample of children. A total of 2,053 children 7 to 10 yr of age were randomly sampled from Auckland primary schools and assessed by a questionnaire and histamine inhalation challenge. In all, 14.3% had had Asthma_ASDPTO_HP diagnosed, 29.6% reported having had one of the four respiratory symptoms in in the previous 12 months, and 15.9% had BHR (PD20 less than or equal to 7.8 mumol histamine). After a cumulative dose of 3.9 mumol histamine, the percent change in FEV1 from postsaline FEV1 was unimodally distributed, with those in whom Asthma_ASDPTO_HP had been diagnosed dominating the Severe_HP end of the spectrum. However, 53% of those with BHR had no Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Diagnosis_ASDPTO, and 41% had no current Asthma_ASDPTO_HP symptoms. On the other hand, 48% of all subjects with diagnosed Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and 42% of children with diagnosed Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and current symptoms did not have BHR. Although Severity_HP of BHR tended to increase with Wheezing_HP Frequency_HP, all grades of Severity_HP (including no BHR) were found for any given Frequency_HP of wheeze. An existing Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP identified symptomatic children more accurately than did BHR, regardless of the criteria used for BHR or for "symptomatic" and irrespective of ethnic group. In conclusion, BHR is related to, but not identical to, clinical Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Bronchial challenge testing is an important tool of respiratory research, but cannot reliably or precisely separate asthmatics from nonasthmatics in the general community.
The interrelationship among bronchial hyperresponsiveness, the diagnosis of asthma, and asthma symptoms.Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) to inhaled histamine has often been cited as the gold standard in asthma diagnosis, but recently this has been questioned. This report assesses the relationship of BHR to asthma symptoms and asthma diagnosis in a large community-based sample of children. A total of 2,053 children 7 to 10 yr of age were randomly sampled from Auckland primary schools and assessed by a questionnaire and histamine inhalation challenge. In all, 14.3% had had asthma diagnosed, 29.6% reported having had one of the four respiratory symptoms in in the previous 12 months, and 15.9% had BHR (PD20 less than or equal to 7.8 mumol histamine). After a cumulative dose of 3.9 mumol histamine, the percent change in FEV1 from postsaline FEV1 was unimodally distributed, with those in whom asthma had been diagnosed dominating the severe end of the spectrum. However, 53% of those with BHR had no asthma diagnosis, and 41% had no current asthma symptoms. On the other hand, 48% of all subjects with diagnosed asthma and 42% of children with diagnosed asthma and current symptoms did not have BHR. Although severity of BHR tended to increase with wheezing frequency, all grades of severity (including no BHR) were found for any given frequency of wheeze. An existing diagnosis of asthma identified symptomatic children more accurately than did BHR, regardless of the criteria used for BHR or for "symptomatic" and irrespective of ethnic group. In conclusion, BHR is related to, but not identical to, clinical asthma.

Effect of inhaled furosemide on metabisulfite- and methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction and nasal potential difference in asthmatic subjects.To evaluate the hypothesis that furosemide inhibits indirect bronchoconstrictor challenges by altering airway epithelial ion transport, we studied its effects on indirect bronchoconstriction induced by inhaled metabisulfite (MBS) and nasal potential difference (PD) in seven subjects with Mild_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Its effect on direct bronchoconstriction by the inhaled muscarinic agonist methacholine (MC) was studied in six of these subjects. Each subject inhaled furosemide, 30 mg, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled fashion immediately before challenge with MBS (0.3 to 160 mg/ml in increasing doubling concentrations) and, in another study, MC (0.125 to 32 mg/ml) aerosols from a nebulizer attached to a dosimeter. PC20MBS and PC20MC, the concentration of each agent needed to lower FEV1 by 20%, were calculated by linear interpolation of the log dose-response curves. Furosemide had no effect on resting lung function, but it caused a significant threefold reduction in sensitivity to MBS (PC20MBS: GM +/- GSEM, 15.1 +/- 1.6 mg/ml after placebo and 40.7 +/- 1.7 mg/ml after furosemide; p less than 0.001) with a protective index of 64.8 +/- 10.7%. Furosemide caused no change in sensitivity to MC (PC20 MC:GM +/- GSEM, 2.37 +/- 1.61 mg/ml after placebo and 2.19 +/- 1.751 mg/ml after furosemide; NS). In a third study, furosemide, 30 mg, and placebo were inhaled through the nose in a randomized double-blind fashion immediately prior to inhalation of a PC20 concentration of MBS through the nose. Nasal PD was measured before and after placebo or furosemide, and again after MBS inhalation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

The American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria for the classification of Churg-Strauss syndrome (allergic Granulomatosis_HP and Vasculitis_HP).Criteria for the classification of Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS) were developed by comparing 20 patients who had this Diagnosis_ASDPTO with 787 control patients with other forms of Vasculitis_HP. For the traditional format classification, 6 criteria were selected: Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, Eosinophilia_HP greater than 10% on differential white blood cell count, Mononeuropathy_HP (including multiplex) or Polyneuropathy_HP, non-fixed Pulmonary_infiltrates_HP on roentgenography, paranasal sinus abnormality, and biopsy containing a blood vessel with extravascular eosinophils. The presence of 4 or more of these 6 criteria yielded a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 99.7%. A classification tree was also constructed with 3 selected criteria: Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, Eosinophilia_HP greater than 10% on differential white blood cell count, and history of documented Allergy_HP other than Asthma_ASDPTO_HP or drug sensitivity. If a subject has Eosinophilia_HP and a documented history of either Asthma_ASDPTO_HP or Allergy_HP, then that subject is classified as having CSS. For the tree classification, the sensitivity was 95% and the specificity was 99.2%. Advantages of the traditional format compared with the classification tree format, when applied to patients with systemic Vasculitis_HP, and their comparison with earlier work on CSS are discussed.

Inflammatory markers in bronchoalveolar lavage and in bronchial biopsy in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP during remission.Bronchoalveolar lavage and BB were performed in 13 asthmatic and six Healthy_HP subjects to characterize cellular markers of inflammation in BAL and BB; to compare cellular profile of BAL with cell infiltration in BB; to examine the relationship between bronchial responsiveness and markers of inflammation in BAL and BB. Eosinophils and mast cells were increased in BAL in asthmatic subjects; eosinophils were positively correlated with neutrophils and mast cells. Epithelial shedding was present in nine asthmatic and five control subjects. Intraepithelial cells and cells in submucosa were increased in asthmatic subjects. Eosinophils and intraepithelial mast cells were higher. Thickened basement membrane was associated with more marked cell infiltration in submucosa. Ciliated cells in BAL relate to intraepithelial cells; cells in BAL broadly reflect cell infiltration of submucosa. In the asthmatic group, the degree of bronchial responsiveness correlated with ciliated cells in BAL and with intra-epithelial cells in BB. Marked airway inflammation is associated with Stable_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP; inflammatory changes within bronchial epithelium may be linked to the development of bronchial hyperresponsiveness.

Efficacy of atropine methylnitrate alone and in combination with albuterol in children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The bronchodilator effect of nebulized AMN, albuterol and their combination was evaluated in 16 steroid-dependent asthmatic children. In phase 1, maximal bronchodilation was determined by dose-response studies on separate days. Maximal bronchodilator dose of each drug was administered either alone or in combination during phase 2. In phase 1, 0.11 +/- 0.01 mg/kg of albuterol and 0.03 mg/kg of AMN produced maximum bronchodilation. In phase 2, the peak response to albuterol occurred within 30 min and to AMN, at 60 min. Maximal FEV1 achieved after AMN was 90 percent of the maximal achieved after albuterol. AMN FEV1 response was better than for placebo for 3 h; that for albuterol was better for 4 h. Combination therapy produced a peak response similar to that of albuterol but was better than albuterol by 6 h. Thus, the maximum bronchodilator effect of AMN is less than that of albuterol in asthmatic children, but the combination may extend the period of bronchodilatation.

Attenuating effect of a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor (OKY-046) on bronchial responsiveness to methacholine is specific to Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.To determine whether the involvement of thromboxane A2 in bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) is specific to Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, we examined the effects of a selective inhibitor of thromboxane synthetase (OKY-046) and a cyclooxygenase inhibitor (indomethacin) on bronchial responsiveness to methacholine in normal subjects and patients with Chronic_Bronchitis_HP, Diffuse_HP Bronchiectasis_HP, and intrinsic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The provocative concentration of methacholine producing a 20 percent fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (PC20-FEV1) was measured before and after oral administration of OKY-046 (2,600 mg over four days) and indomethacin (450 mg over three days) in ten normal, ten bronchitic, nine bronchiectatic, and eight Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic subjects, respectively. Baseline values of FEV1 and forced vital capacity (FVC) were not altered by OKY-046 or indomethacin. The geometric mean value of PC20-FEV1 increased significantly (p less than 0.005) from 1.78 to 4.27 mg/ml after OKY-046 in Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic subjects, but not in normal, bronchitic, or bronchiectatic subjects. On the other hand, PC20-FEV1 increased significantly (p less than 0.005) from 2.19 to 8.13 mg/ml after indomethacin in bronchiectatic subjects, but not in normal, bronchitic, or Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic subjects. We conclude that the involvement of thromboxane A2 in BHR may be specific to Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, and bronchial responsiveness of Bronchiectasis_HP may be potentiated by inflammatory release of bronchoconstrictor prostaglandins except for thromboxane A2. Further studies using thromboxane A2 receptor antagonists are needed to confirm the conclusion.

[Increased sensitivity to Candida in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].As many as 86 children aged 3 to 14 years with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were examined using mycological, immunological and allergological methods including the prick-test, basophil degranulation test (direct Shelley's test) and leukocyte migration inhibition test with Candida antigen. As far as the patients living in the vicinity of a microbiological factory are concerned, hypersensitivity to Candida was detected in 83.3% of cases, primarily that of the delayed type (37%). In children with verified candidiasis, hypersensitivity to Candida fungi was also detectable in 83.3% of cases, but in the majority of patients (47%), it was of the immediate type. In the control group, allergic candidiasis was diagnosed in 20% of cases. Clinically, Asthma_ASDPTO_HP associated with allergic candidiasis was characterized by Refractory_HP, lingering obstructive Bronchitis_HP amenable to antimycotic drugs.

[Epidemiologic study of risk factors associated with the development of respiratory pathology in children].A total of 1,566 children the area of Valencia (Spain), of both sexes and aged 7 to 14 received an epidemiological questionnaire recommended by the American Thoracic Society. Antecedents of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were recorded in 79 cases (5%), with a predominance among males; 73.3% of these children presented their first crisis before age three. Eighty-seven children were habitual smokers (5.6%), again with a predominance among males-most of these children being between 13 and 14 years old. A Family_history_HP of Smoking_ASDPTO was observed in 82.8% of the children who were habitual smokers. A greater predominance of Smoking_ASDPTO mothers was observed at higher socio-economical levels--with no significant differences between parents. The incidence of respiratory pathology (Cough_HP and antecedents of Bronchitis_HP) was higher among children whose mothers (or both parents) were smokers. On comparing the two areas of the city with the greatest difference in air pollution level, no significant differences were observed in respiratory morbidity among the child population.

[Repercussion of risk factors associated with the development of Chronic_HP bronchial pathology on pulmonary function in children].Of a total of 1,566 children, 1,416 of both sexes and aged 7 to 14 were subjected to functional respiratory exploration with a Vitalograph dry spirometer. The impact of tobacco smoke--as active and/or passive smokers--on the spirometric variables (FVC, FEV1, FEF2572, FEF50) evaluated by variance analysis (ANOVA) revealed no significant reductions. Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was the single antecedent of respiratory morbidity showing significant reductions in FEF2575, FEF50 among males alone; no significant reductions were observed for any of the other spirometric variables. No significant decreases were found in the spirometric variables on comparing two areas of the same city with the greatest difference in air pollution level.

The Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Emphysema_HP, Chronic_Bronchitis_HP, and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Although of some value for understanding etiologic mechanisms, the classic diagnostic categories of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Emphysema_HP and especially Chronic_Bronchitis_HP have not served clinicians well for defining prognosis and therapeutic options. Until more useful diagnostic categories are available, the choice of diagnostic tests should be guided more by their clinical usefulness than by their sensitivity and specificity for identifying classic diagnostic categories of Obstructive_lung_disease_HP. A history consistent with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is as good evidence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP as that provided by most tests, especially if combined with spirometric evidence of complete reversibility of episodes of obstruction. Positive bronchial challenge studies and partial responses to bronchodilators are common in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP but of limited diagnostic specificity. Tests of allergic function are of limited specificity for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, although a low IgE level is rare. Findings of reduced expiratory flows, high TLC, and low DLCO, or radiologic signs of hyperinflation, bullae, and pulmonary vascular deficiency pattern are useful for diagnosing cases of Severe_HP Emphysema_HP, but they are of limited sensitivity for the detection of Mild_HP to Moderate_HP disease. Advances in high resolution CT offer promise of earlier Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Emphysema_HP. Making a Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Chronic_Bronchitis_HP based on defined criteria for Chronic_HP sputum production is easy but of limited clinical value. Prospective longitudinal studies and advances in technology promise more clinically useful diagnoses in the future.

Making a diagnosis of chronic bronchitis based on defined criteria for chronic sputum production is easy but of limited clinical value. Prospective longitudinal studies and advances in technology promise more clinically useful diagnoses in the future.
[Radiologic findings and differential Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in childhood].In children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, routine chest X-ray typically shows bilaterally increased air volume, low diaphragms, wide diaphragmatic angles, and often a slender cardiac silhouette with a prominent pulmonic arch. Such an X-ray is not diagnostic of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP itself, however, but rather of its complications: pneumonitis (particularly in toddlers with infectious Asthma_ASDPTO_HP), Atelectasis_HP due to mucus obstruction, and, rarely, extra-alveolar air trapping (Pneumomediastinum_HP with or without cutaneous Emphysema_HP more often than Pneumothorax_HP). The differential Diagnosis_ASDPTO has to rule out "pseudo Asthma_ASDPTO_HP" due to cystic fibrosis, alveolitis, Achalasia_HP, and foreign body Aspiration_HP.

Effect of caffeine on histamine bronchoprovocation in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.It was recently reported that caffeine may reduce the clinical symptoms of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and may prevent the clinical manifestations of this disease. The effect of caffeine on histamine responsiveness is unknown. The effect of caffeine (5 mg/kg) and placebo on histamine responsiveness (the provocation concentration causing a 20% fall in FEV1, PC20) was studied in 10 subjects with Mild_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (prechallenge FEV1 84% of predicted value). The PC20 for histamine bronchoprovocation after caffeine ingestion was 2.65 (95% confidence limits 0.99, 7.10) mg/ml. After placebo the PC20 was 1.89 (0.96, 3.71) mg/ml. It is concluded that caffeine in a dose equivalent to about three cups of coffee has a very small effect, if any, on histamine bronchoprovocation in those with Mild_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Specific instructions about not having drinks containing caffeine before histamine challenge are therefore not necessary.

Relationship between Recurrent_HP croup and airway hyperreactivity.The relationship between Recurrent_HP croup and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was evaluated by measuring bronchial hyperreactivity (methacholine challenge), physiologic parameters of Upper_airway_obstruction_HP, and skin response to environmental allergens. Patients with Recurrent_HP croup (n = 10) had a significantly higher degree of airway hyperreactivity and atopy than Healthy_HP children (n = 15), but significantly less than the patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (n = 30). No physiologic signs of Upper_airway_obstruction_HP could be detected at rest or following methacholine. It is suggested that Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Recurrent_HP croup share a few characteristics.

Mucoid impaction of upper lobe bronchi in the absence of Proximal_HP Bronchiectasis_HP.Mucoid impaction is a complication of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and is frequently Recurrent_HP in patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). This report describes a patient with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Recurrent_HP Bilateral_HP well-circumscribed densities on chest roentgenogram in the absence of ABPA. Recognition of this clinical presentation may avoid the need for invasive diagnostic procedures or steroid therapy.

Characteristics and correlates of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in a university clinic population.To contribute more comprehensive information about the characteristics of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, this article analyzed patients served by the University of Alabama at Birmingham Comprehensive Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Program. Their physicians rated one fifth of these patients as having "Severe_HP" Asthma_ASDPTO_HP with the remainder about equally divided between "Moderate_HP" and "Mild_HP". One in two first received a Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP ten or more years previously. Common Comorbidities_ASDPTO were Hypertension_HP, Obesity_HP, Rhinitis_HP, Bronchitis_HP, Sinusitis_HP, and Arthritis_HP. One half had visited an emergency room or been hospitalized for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in the past year. Inhaled bronchodilators and continuous theophylline were the most commonly prescribed Medications_ASDPTO. Side effects, especially Tachycardia_HP and Insomnia_HP, were common and almost exclusively associated with theophylline or corticosteroid therapy. Spirometric assessment showed Chronic_HP airflow obstruction in those with more Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Prevalence of respiratory symptoms, Severity_HP of medication regimen, incidence of side effects, and health care utilization increased as Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Severity_HP increased.

Quality of life in elderly patients with Chronic_HP nonspecific Abnormal_lung_morphology_HP seen in family practice.We studied the quality of life of elderly patients with Chronic_HP nonspecific Abnormal_lung_morphology_HP (CNSLD) in family practice. We also investigated the relationship between patients' somatic condition and their quality of life. Seventy patients, aged 40 years or older, with a Diagnosis_ASDPTO or symptoms of CNSLD completed the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) and the list of daily activities (DAL). Pulmonary function (FEV1, IVC) and respiratory symptoms were assessed. The results indicated that patients were more impaired in their physical and psychosocial functioning than Healthy_HP control subjects. Most lung function parameters showed no correlation with the SIP scores. The respiratory symptoms of Wheezing_HP and Dyspnea_HP were related to patients' quality of life. Patients with Chronic_HP obstructive pulmonary disease (Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP) were more restricted in their daily functioning than patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Since the relationship between patients' somatic condition and their quality of life is weak, we recommend comprehensive care that encompasses psychosocial as well as somatic interventions.

Reactive airway dysfunction syndrome in three police officers following a roadside chemical spill.The reactive airway dysfunction syndrome (RADS) is a recently described syndrome in which bronchial hyperreactivity and asthmatic symptoms develop in previously Healthy_HP individuals after a single large exposure to an irritating gas, fume, or vapor. We report a cluster of three Philadelphia police officers who developed RADS after a common exposure to toxic fumes from a roadside truck accident. Results of initial pulmonary function testing were normal in all three, and methacholine challenge was required for Diagnosis_ASDPTO in two out of the three. This syndrome needs to be recognized by physicians dealing with environmental or industrial medicine as a potential cause of loss of work or inability to perform on the job. Also, there is a potential for multiple individuals to develop this syndrome from a single incident.

Effect of PAF-acether inhalation on nonspecific bronchial reactivity and adrenergic response in normal and asthmatic subjects.Bronchial hyperreactivity, although recognized as a hallmark of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, is not totally understood. Mast cell-derived mediators, including histamine, have been shown to cause immediate bronchoconstriction, but until recently, no single mediator has been shown to induce Prolonged_HP changes in airway reactivity. Recent reports indicate PAF-acether (PAF) can induce increased nonspecific bronchial reactivity in normal subjects but not in asthmatics. We sought to elucidate the role of PAF in airway hyperreactivity by comparing the effect of inhaled PAF on methacholine and isoproterenol airway responsiveness in six nonasthmatic and six asthmatic subjects. Neither nonspecific airway reactivity nor isoproterenol responsiveness was changed following PAF inhalation in the nonasthmatic subjects in the six days following PAF. asthmatics had increased airway responsiveness to methacholine at two hours post-PAF, which did not persist. Responsiveness to isoproterenol did not change in the asthmatic subjects. Additional evaluation of the role of PAF in causing changes in airway reactivity is warranted.

[The dispersion and allergenicity of the airborne pollen in Nanjing].This paper presents the results of a two-year study on the dispersion and allergenicity of the airborne pollen in Nanjing. We found 28 families of pollen of plant dispersing in the city. Seventeen species of commonly seen pollen grouped under twelve families were collected and their pollen extracts were used for skin test in the 219 cases of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The results showed the mode of dispersion of air-borne pollen and the main families of allergic pollen being the Moraceae' Cupressaceae platanuceae and Julandaceae in spring and the gramineae Compositae Chenopodiaceae and Cannabinaceae in autumn. This information provides a firm basis in the prevention Diagnosis_ASDPTO and treatment of allergic diseases in the area of Nanjing.

Parental Smoking_ASDPTO and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in childhood.The effect of parental Smoking_ASDPTO on childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was investigated in which data from 302 asthmatic and 433 Healthy_HP children aged 1 to 12 years, were studied. All asthmatic patients received prick tests for common allergens. A significantly higher number of heavy parental smokers was found in asthmatic children under 6 years of age with negative prick tests (P = 0.02). A stepwise logistic regression was performed in order to verify interactions between parental Smoking_ASDPTO and other variables. It is concluded that parental Smoking_ASDPTO is an important risk factor for "prick test negative" asthmatic children aged 6 years or less.

[Therapy of Allergic_rhinitis_HP and pollen Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in children with a new, modified allergen extract].During a period of 3 years a controlled and prospective study was performed, in which 20 children with pollinosis and pollen Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (grass pollen) were treated either with a new modified allergenic extract (preparation I: Purethal) or with a standard semi-depot extract (preparation II: Depot-HAL) from the same producer. During the pollen season symptoms, side effects, additional medication, and pollen counts were registered. 20 patients were treated perennially: 5 with preparation II and with reduction of the doses during the pollen season (group A: treatment during 3 successive years), 15 without reduction of the doses during te season with preparation I (group B, 8 patients: treatment during 3 successive years; group C, 7 patients: treatment during 2 successive years). Patients in all groups showed more symptoms in May and June. In the groups B and C less symptoms were recorded. Especially, the score of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP symptoms decreased. However, the need for additional medication was somewhat higher in these groups as compared to group A. The differences were not statistically significant. In 50% of the children no local side reactions were observed after the subcutaneous injections. In the groups B and C the number of late local reactions after 6 to 8 hours was somewhat higher. The patients treated with preparation I did not show an increase of allergen-specific IgG during the pollen season. The relative contribution of allergen-specific IgG1 and IgG4 to total specific IgG was lower in the blood samples of these patients as compared to those of group A. The efficacy and the therapeutic safety of the two preparations are comparable. Preparation I has a number of practical advantages, especially in the treatment of children.

Breathing patterns in asthmatic children during attack.Breathing patterns in asthmatic children during attack were studied using multielectrode impedance pneumography. A great number of respiration patterns were analyzed by a personal computer. During Severe_HP attacks, a pattern of Prolonged_HP expiratory time was noted. Inspiratory time, however, did not change, regardless of the Severity_HP of the asthmatic attack. No remarkable changes in breathing patterns were recognized during Mild_HP attacks. It was, therefore, considered that breathing patterns remained essentially unchanged except in cases of Severe_HP asthmatic attacks.

Ethylenediamine-induced late asthmatic responses.We report two asthmatics working in the same factory who exhibited late asthmatic responses (LAR) to ethylenediamine (EDA) vapor. After several months of exposure to EDA, both patients developed productive Cough_HP, Wheezing_HP, and Dyspnea_HP. Provocative inhalation tests using EDA evoked LAR in both patients, but it did not evoke any asthmatic symptoms in Healthy_HP subjects. IgE antibodies to EDA examined by intracutaneous and P-K tests were detected. It appears that, in these two cases, LAR are mainly due to immediate-type allergic reactions.

Enhanced reactive oxygen species metabolism of airspace cells and airway inflammation follow antigen challenge in human Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Airflow limitation and airway inflammation follow antigen bronchoprovocation in sensitized individuals. Inflammation likely results from the interplay of several previously demonstrated factors, but the participation and persistence of enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism of airspace cells after antigen challenge have received more limited attention. We studied nine subjects with Mild_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP by bronchoalveolar lavage before and 48 (one subject) to 72 (eight subjects) hours after antigen bronchoprovocation and compared airspace cell numbers and types, cell function, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid protein, albumin, and immunoglobulins. Mild_HP, but significant, airflow limitation persisted at the time of the second lavage. Eosinophil influx was a notable component of the increased airspace cells in postchallenge lavages. Airspace cells demonstrated significantly enhanced ROS metabolism, and total protein, albumin, and IgM levels were higher in postchallenge lavage specimens. Antigen bronchial challenge produces airspace inflammation, which may develop, in part, as a consequence of enhanced ROS metabolism of airspace cells.

Repeated exposure of asthmatic airways to inhaled adenosine 5'-monophosphate attenuates bronchoconstriction provoked by exercise.Inhaled adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) induces bronchoconstriction in subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, probably caused by histamine release from airway mast cells, and repeated AMP bronchial challenge leads to attenuation of the bronchoconstrictor response. Since exercise-induced bronchoconstriction may be mediated by hypertonic mast cell degranulation, we postulated that repeated AMP bronchial challenge should reduce the response to subsequent exercise challenge. Eight atopic subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP took part in an unblinded, randomized trial. On the control study day, a treadmill exercise test previously demonstrated to induce a greater than 20% fall in FEV1 was performed. On the AMP study day, three AMP dose-response bronchial challenges were performed at 1-hour intervals. Each AMP challenge was continued until either a provocative concentration causing a 20% fall in FEV1 had been achieved (PC20) and the PC20 was calculated, or the maximum concentration of AMP (400 mg/ml) had been administered. After recovery of the FEV1 from AMP challenge, a treadmill exercise test identical to the test on the control study day was performed. On the AMP study day, the geometric mean PC20 was 15.3 (7.9 to 29.5) mg/ml for the first test, and 28.2 (10.7 to 77.4) mg/ml for the third test (not significant). On the control study day, the mean maximum percentage fall in FEV1 after exercise was 28.0% +/- 2.7%, whereas on the AMP study day, it was reduced to 13.0% +/- 4.3% (p less than 0.01). A significant correlation was found between the change in responsiveness to AMP induced by repeated challenge and the attenuation of the subsequent exercise response (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

The effect of sodium nucleinate on allergic and immunological reactions.Experiments on immunized rabbits and guinea pigs indicated that sodium nucleinate (SN) was capable of weakening or entirely eliminating anaphylactic and skin reactions of delayed type hypersensitivity to repeated administration of staphyloanatoxin, APDT vaccine. The findings on patients with the infectious form of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Chronic_HP rheumatism showed that sodium nucleinate attenuated reactions to the subcutaneous administration of staphylococcal and streptococcal allergens. The treatment of patients suffering from infectious-allergic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and rheumatism with SN resulted in the recovery of deficient T cells, T-suppressors, normalization of immunoglobulin concentrations. In children with Acute_HP Glomerulonephritis_HP sodium nucleinate normalized decreased T-suppressor cells and increased IgG and Circulating_immune_complexes_HP (CIC), resulting in a pronounced remission of disease. The mechanism of desensitization and elimination of CIC by SN has not been explored, however, the parameters of SN-induced immunomodulation are known rather completely. It is suggested that SN brings about accumulation in the cell of cyclic AMP which diminished membrane permeability, activates monoaminooxidase resulting in the degradation of histamine and other biogenic amines, enhances the synthesis of endogenous corticosteroids with their desensitizing properties. All these effects contribute to the elimination of delayed type hypersensitivity. The role of SN in the inhibition of delayed type hypersensitivity remains obscure.

All these effects contribute to the elimination of delayed type hypersensitivity. The role of SN in the inhibition of delayed type hypersensitivity remains obscure.
[A case of Pneumocystis carinii Pneumonia_HP with hyperinfection of Strongyloides stercoralis complicated with smoldering adult T-cell Leukemia_HP].A 43-year-old woman visited a clinic for an attack of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP which she had been suffering since her childhood. She was treated with prednisolone which was used for the first time. Two weeks later, she had a Fever_HP and her chest X-ray showed Diffuse_HP reticulonodular shadows on both middle to lower lung fields. In spite of the use of antibacterial drugs, her symptoms such as Cough_HP, Dyspnea_HP, Fatigue_HP and Fever_HP increased. It was revealed that she had Stronglyoides sterocoralis in the stool. She was referred to our department for treatment and further examination. Transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) was performed, and cyst of Pneumocystis carinii were histologically detected in the lung specimen. Anti-human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) antibody in the serum was 1:4,096 less than. Typical adult T-cell Leukemia_HP (ATL) cells were also observed in the Peripheral_HP blood smear at the rate of 10-15% of leukocytes. The parasite was observed in the sputum too. We diagnosed her as having Pneumocystis carinii Pneumonia_HP with hyperinfection of Strongyloides stercoralis complicated with smoldering ATL, and the Pneumonia_HP might have been induced by steroid therapy (total doses of 500 mg, for 25 days). After sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST compound) was used for the Pneumocystis carinii Pneumonia_HP, her symptoms markedly subsided, and the chest X-ray findings turned to normal by 45 days after the treatment. Thiabendazole was initially administered for the Strongyloidiasis and the parasite temporarily disappeared from both sputum and stool. Then pyrvinium pamoate and mebendazole were used, but the parasite could not be completely eradicated in the stool. We did not treat the smoldering ATL because there were no symptoms. We have been looking after her as an outpatient now, and she has neither symptoms nor signs.

Ego development and Chronic_HP illness in adolescents.To examine the effects of Chronic_HP illness on the psychological growth process known as ego development, scores were compared on the Loevinger Sentence Completion Test for 36 teens (16 boys, 20 girls) with Chronic_HP illness and 50 teens (16 boys, 34 girls) without Chronic_HP illness. Their ages ranged from 13 to 21 years, with a mean of 17.4 years. Most were Black (37%) or Hispanic (41%) and lived in poor or working-class neighborhoods. When age, sex, and Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) scores were controlled in multiple regression analyses, no direct association between ego development stage and presence of Chronic_HP illness, Severity_HP of illness, age at Onset_HP, or duration of illness was found. Analysis of the Chronic_HPally ill group alone revealed a significant PPVT X Severity_HP interaction, indicating that ego development in Chronic_HPally ill teens is lower when illness is more Severe_HP and verbal IQ is higher.

[A case of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Aggravated_by_HP sulfite contained in betamethasone].Adverse reactions to preservatives contained in food and Medications_ASDPTO have been recognized with increasing Frequency_HP. We have recently seen an asthmatic patient in whom Wheezing_HP and Dyspnea_HP increased after injection of betamethasone. The patient was a 26-year-old woman who had had bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP since 1980. She was treated at another hospital for Moderate_HP Wheezing_HP and betamethasone injections were given in May 1988. After this treatment her condition deteriorated acutely and she was transferred to our hospital. To confirm the possible relationship between betamethasone (sulfite) and asthmatic attack, provocation challenge tests were conducted. Intradermal skin test revealed an immediate positive reaction to sodium bisulfite at a concentration of 100 mg/L. Challenge test with increasing amounts of sodium bisulfite showed a 52% decrease in FEV1, 50 min after inhalation of 5 mg/ml solution. In addition, another inhalation challenge was conducted by use of an Astograph. Rrs immediately increased during inhalation of 10 mg/ml solution. These results suggested that sulfite contained in betamethasone preparation provoked exaggerated Bronchospasm_HP in this patient.

[Severe_HP bronchial reaction induced by hydrocortisone sodium succinate in an aspirin-sensitive Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patient].This is a report of a female patient who had an Anaphylactic_shock_HP-like reactions to hydrocortisone sodium succinate (Saxizon). A 31-year-old female with intrinsic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and aspirin sensitivity was admitted to our hospital because of an episode of Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic attack. The patient had had episodes of Dyspnea_HP since 1976, and had been treated with oral bronchodilators and Recurrent_HP corticosteroids. After admission, she was given 100 mg of hydrocortisone sodium succinate intravenously. A few minutes later she developed Severe_HP Bronchospasm_HP and lost consciousness. An endotracheal tube was inserted and she was mechanically ventilated for 2 hours. The patient recovered after 1 hour. An inhalation challenge test with Sulpyrin was positive. When the provocation challenge test with 100 mg of hydrocortisone sodium succinate (Saxizon) injection was performed, she developed subjective and objective evidence of Bronchospasm_HP. Intradermal skin test revealed positive immediate reactions to Saxizon, Solu-cortef, Predonine. It is suggested that she had immediate hypersensitivity to hydrocortisone sodium succinate, but the mechanism of this Anaphylactic_shock_HP-like reaction to steroids is not certain.

[Bronchoconstrictive and bronchodilating effects of acetylsalicylic acid in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].An aspirin test has been performed in 100 Asthma_ASDPTO_HP patients. The response of the bronchi appeared contradictory: aspirin Asthma_ASDPTO_HP on the one hand, and bronchodilatation on the other occurred in 31 and 28 patients, respectively; 41 patients appeared nonresponders. Maximum effect of the drug was noted in the small bronchi. Desensitization to aspirin and hemosorption reduced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP patients sensitivity to nonsteroid antiinflammatory drugs.

[Pathogenetic variants of the obstructive syndrome in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].The study is made of the causes underlying a variety of obstruction syndrome presentation in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP sufferers. Heterogenic pathogenesis of the disease is related to predominance of one of the three obstruction components: Bronchospasm_HP, inflammatory Edema_HP of the mucosa and sputum obturation of the airways as a result of defective expectoration. To quantify the components objectively, a special program of the patients' examination has been devised involving: 1) analysis of clinical symptoms, 2) pharmacological testing with selective and nonselective sympathomimetic agents and cholinolytics, 3) registration of the duration of the bronchial sputum evacuation (time of expectoration). Basing on relevant results, three variants of the obstruction are distinguished: bronchospastic, inflammatory-Edema_HPtous++, obturation. The Severity_HP of bronchial obstruction progresses from the first to the third variant. Moreover, the efficacy of Bronchospasm_HPolytic drugs diminishes as shown by pharmacological tests: first of selective beta 2-agonists and cholinolytics followed by non-selective sympathomimetic agents which may be attributed to their additional alpha-stimulating action. In view of this the question of clinical significance of alpha-stimulated bronchial constriction is discussed with reference to original and literature data.

[Cytogenetic effects of hyperbaric oxygenation].This paper presents cytogenetic data obtained from Peripheral_HP blood of patients who were treated with hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) at 0.15-0.2 MPa for 40 min daily during 10 days. The patients showed a significant increase of chromosome aberrations mainly caused by chromatid and chromosome breaks. The level of induced aberrations showed individual variations. These results suggest that HBO may have an indirect effect on the genetic apparatus of human somatic cells.

Surgery for Sinusitis_HP and aspirin triad.An 11-year retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the surgical treatment of Sinusitis_HP in aspirin-triad patients. Twenty-five patients were selected for surgery when their Sinusitis_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP progressed despite intense medical treatment. Sixteen patients had radiographic evidence of Severe_HP ethmoid disease, and their initial surgical procedures were limited (i.e., Bilateral_HP intranasal ethmoidectomies). Of these 16 patients, 6 required subsequent surgery for Recurrent_HP Sinusitis_HP. Nine of the 25 patients had radiographic evidence of Severe_HP antral, as well as ethmoid, disease. Their initial surgical procedures were radical, i.e., Bilateral_HP Caldwell-Luc operations with intranasal and transantral sphenoethmoidectomies. None of these 9 patients required further surgical treatment for control. This review indicates that if antral and sphenoid disease are detected in association with ethmoid involvement, a radical surgical approach is the operation of choice.

Eosinophilic inflammation in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The importance of eosinophils in the pathogenesis of bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is not established. In an attempt to evaluate the role of eosinophilic inflammation in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, we compared 10 normal subjects with 43 patients with Chronic_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, 19 of whom had Severe_HP disease as assessed by a clinical scoring method described by Aas and by pulmonary-function tests. Eosinophils were counted in Peripheral_HP blood and bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid, and in biopsy specimens obtained from the patients and post mortem from 8 subjects without Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, but not from the 10 normal controls. Eosinophil cationic protein was titrated by radioimmunoassay in the bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid from all subjects and studied by immunohistochemistry in the biopsy specimens.

Immune and Autoimmune_Diseases_ASDPTO in dyslexic children.One hundred and five dyslexic and 105 control children were compared for Frequency_HP of immune diseases, Autoimmune_Diseases_ASDPTO, and non-Right_HP-handedness in the light of the Geschwind-Behan (1982) "testosterone hypothesis". The results showed significantly more immune- and autoimmune-diseases int he dyslexic group. There were no differences between the groups in the Frequency_HP of non-Right_HP-handedness. There were no interactions with gender, although there were more non-Right_HP-handed boys than girls in the total sample. Mothers of children who were dyslexic experienced significantly more negative life-events during pregnancy, they also experienced the pregnancy as more difficult, and they had more spontaneous abortions. In conclusion, the results support some aspects of the "testosterone hypothesis", but they also point to a more complex pattern of interaction between the factors that still remain unanswered.

Nebulized albuterol in Acute_HP childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP: comparison of two doses.Thirty-three children and adolescents from 5 to 17 years of age with Moderate_HP to Severe_HP Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were given nebulized albuterol therapy in either a high (0.30 mg/kg body weight) or standard (0.15 mg/kg) dose administered at three hourly intervals in a randomized double-blind study. The high-dose hourly regimen resulted in significantly greater improvement in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). Furthermore, patients receiving the high dose showed a steady improvement in the FEV1 from the start to the end of the study, whereas FEV1 plateaued after the second dose in the standard-dose group. Although a rise in heart rate and a fall in serum potassium level occurred, neither of these changes nor other side effects were different in the two groups. The high-dose therapy resulted in much higher serum albuterol levels than the standard dose. There was no correlation between the drug levels and side effects or initial and subsequent FEV1. It is concluded that Occasional_HP hourly high-dose albuterol therapy should be considered for some pediatric patients with Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP of Moderate_HP Severity_HP, especially those who relapse between doses.

[Determination of theophylline serum level: comparison between a rapid test (enzyme-immuno-chromatography) and conventional fluorescence polarization immunoassay].To evaluate the reliability and accuracy of a rapidly performed enzyme immunochromatography method for measuring the serum concentration of theophylline, we compared it with a conventional technique (fluorescence-polarisation immunoassay). We investigated 103 venous blood samples from children and adolescents with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, medicated with sustained-release theophylline preparations. There was a highly significant correlation of the measured values; with a few exceptions, the individual values scattered only narrowly around the regression line. Based on this close correlation, the investigated enzyme immunochromatography test can be recommended for rapid theophylline serum level determinations in clinical practice.

Nocturnal_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, its pathogenesis and treatment.Many chronobiologic and cyclic environmental factors are implicated in the pathophysiology of Nocturnal_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. A better understanding of these interrelating processes is essential for an optimization of Medications_ASDPTO for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. A reasonable therapeutic approach for the management of Nocturnal_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is the use of inhaled beta-agonists routinely, on a daily basis, and if symptoms persist, the use of an appropriate SR theophylline scheduled once-daily in the evening. Inhaled cromolyn sodium and corticosteroid therapy, properly timed to rhythms, may be warranted to control inflammation and stabilize the airways.

[Inflammation of the bronchial mucosa as the basis for airway hyperreactivity].The mechanisms that are involved in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP pathogenesis have been the subject of intensive research in the last few years. Numerous studies have shown involvement of inflammatory cells and their mediators in the damage of the bronchi. Inflammation leads to morphological changes in the bronchial wall: damage of the epithelium, increased deposition of collagen beneath the epithelial basement membrane, Edema_HP and infiltration of the mucosa with inflammatory cells, hyperplasia of the mucous glands and hypertrophy of the bronchial smooth muscles. The relationship between inflammation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness is complex and remains unclear. This review article will encompass the current understanding of inflammatory mechanisms in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and their association with morphological changes in the airways and the syndrome of bronchial hyperresponsiveness.

[Evidence of the harmful effects of eosinophils in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].Fifteen Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients were prospectively selected. If they had more than 450 eosinophils in Peripheral_HP blood on admission to hospital treatment and if before BAL had been performed they were not treated by corticosteroids. No associated disease was found which could cause the increased number of eosinophils in Peripheral_HP blood except Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. BAL was performed when the subjects tested had no Dyspnea_HP, usually 1-3 days after the hospital admission. In contrast to blood Eosinophilia_HP, increase of eosinophils number in BAL was found to correlate to impairment of clinically measured parameters such as: ventilation level of blood gases and duration of hospitalisation. On the contrary there was no correlation between the level of blood Eosinophilia_HP and gas disturbance and duration of hospitalisation. Eosinophilic proteins (MBP, ECP, EPX, EPO) are not the only that harmfully effect the lung cells in the Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic attack but the fact that their level in lavage fluid correlates to Eosinophilia_HP degree in BAL is evident so the correlation between the number of eosinophils in BAL and impairment of clinically measured parameters is clear.

In contrast to blood eosinophilia, increase of eosinophils number in BAL was found to correlate to impairment of clinically measured parameters such as: ventilation level of blood gases and duration of hospitalisation. On the contrary there was no correlation between the level of blood eosinophilia and gas disturbance and duration of hospitalisation. Eosinophilic proteins (MBP, ECP, EPX, EPO) are not the only that harmfully effect the lung cells in the asthmatic attack but the fact that their level in lavage fluid correlates to eosinophilia degree in BAL is evident so the correlation between the number of eosinophils in BAL and impairment of clinically measured parameters is clear.
[The role bronchial circulation in the etiopathogenesis of increased bronchial reactivity].The relationship between pathoanatomical changes in bronchial arteries and occurrence of Chronic_HP obstructive Bronchitis_HP (COB) and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (BA) was studied. Pathoanatomical changes in bronchial arteries were more frequently found in patients with COB and BA than in patients with other bronchopulmonary diseases, i.e. that bronchial circulation in patients with COB and BA is impaired. Due to these findings a theory of vasculary-metabolic explanation of pathogenesis of bronchial hyperresponsiveness is based on hypoperfusion and hypoxia of cellular structures in the bronchial wall. Hypoxia is supposed to be an endogenous change in the bronchial wall which causes bronchial hyperresponsiveness in various exogenous stimulants.

[Normal reactivity and hyperreactivity in the bronchi induced by respiratory irritants].The influence of age, sex, atopy, baseline spirometry and Smoking_ASDPTO habit on the presentation of airway reactivity (AR), and the prevalence of hyperreactive subjects was assessed in 176 normals and 143 subjects occupationally exposed to respiratory irritants. The study protocol comprised: a respiratory disease questionnaire, physical examination, skin prick-test to 13 common inhalant allergens, IgE level, spirometry. The nonspecific bronchoprovocation test (NBPT) was performed by the cumulative method proposed by Chai et al. (J Allergy_HP Clin Immunol 1975; 56: 323-327). The results are expressed as PC20FEV1, PC25FEF50, PC25FEF25 and PC25FEF25/75. Age, sex, atopy, baseline spirometric values and Smoking_ASDPTO are not significantly correlated with indeces of AR. There are no hyperreactors among Healthy_HP subjects--according to the criterion: PC20FEV1 less than or equal to 2.17 micromoles of histamine. When the response was measured by flow-volume parameters, there were between 5.1% and 9% hyperreactors. In both examined groups AR has proved to be a highly variable feature. Among workers exposed to irritants there were 5.6% hyperreactors according to PC20FEV1 and between 11.1% and 13.9% when flow-volume parameters were applied. A significant correlation between AR and Smoking_ASDPTO habit of subjects occupationally exposed to irritants was not found. The level of AR when monitored by flow-volume parameters of subjects continuously exposed to irritants was found to be significantly lower than in normals. The chosen criterion separates successfully airway normo- from hyperreactives. It is a useful diagnostic method in occupational medicine.

[The Severity_HP of bronchial hyperreactivity and the evolution of pulmonary function].The relationship between the degree of the bronchial hyperreactivity (BH) and evolution or prognosis of the Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is determined in this prospective study. BH has been examined in 108 Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic children and after a long period of time (average 5.5 years), the pulmonary function (VC, FEV1, FEF25-75, Raw, IGV, RV/TLC, flow-volume curve was evaluated. Decreased_pulmonary_function_HP was found not to correlate with the degree of the BH. It is concluded that the degree of the BH might predict the evolution and the prognosis of the Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

[Etiopathogenic mechanisms of increased airway responsiveness].Views on mechanisms of increased airway responsiveness in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and other respiratory tract are presented. The data have been divided into three parts: mucosal and submucosal changes, changes in airway regulations and effector cells. In the first part the etiopathological mechanisms of inflammatory processes in airways are explained. The second part views the neurogenic and other airway disorders (vagus reflex arc, local axon reflex, epithelial relaxing factor) while the third focuses on the receptor activity changes and cellular mechanisms known to cause airway hypersensitivity and hyperreactivity.

[Simultaneous recording of nonspecific bronchial response using continuous measurement of total respiratory resistance and oxygen saturation of arterial blood].In 78 patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP symptoms undergoing nonspecific bronchial response test with bronchoprovocation inhalation of progressively increased methacholine concentrations, total respiratory resistance (Rrs) and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of arterial blood were continually measured. An average Rrs increase was 153% when compared to the initial values and it correlated with SaO2 decrease (5.5% of the initial values). In 45 patients along with continual Rrs and SaO2 measurements, bronchoprovocation test and spirogram flow-volume curve were periodically done. Ten of these patients had no significant Rrs or FEV1 changes, but there was a considerable drop in FEF50, FEF25 and SaO2. These results, associated with Dyspnea_HP and physical pulmonary findings in the course of BPT, as well as history of patients with similar difficulties in every-day life and in work environment, point to the need of expanding diagnostic criteria for positive BPT and for patients who did not have Rrs increased double the initial values nor sufficient FEV1 20% drop. Spirometry and oximetry as complementary methods, increase Astograph sensitivity to methacholine test. Oximetry has an advantage of enabling continual SaO2 monitoring and increased patient's safety during the BPT.

Forced expiratory flow and oscillometric impedance measurement in evaluating airway obstruction.The application of forced oscillations has been introduced as a noninvasive method to measure the impedance of the respiratory system. Impedance can be partitioned into a real part or resistance and an imaginary part or reactance. The reactance depends on the elastic and inertial properties of the respiratory system. In the present study, resistance and reactance obtained in a Frequency_HP spectrum between 4 and 52 Hz were compared with maximal forced expiratory spirometry in 100 out-patients, aged 18-70 years. Resonant Frequency_HP and Frequency_HP dependence of resistance correlated significantly with selected parameters of the forced expiratory flow volume curve: correlation coefficient values ranged from 0.492 between Frequency_HP dependence and FVC and 0.668 between resonant Frequency_HP and FEV1. No correlation between average resistance and spirometric parameters reached a statistically significant level. No marked difference was observed between spirometric parameters depending on the early or effort-dependent portion and those parameters depending on the late or effort independent portion of the maximum forced expiration. It can be concluded that each measurement procedure reveals different but characteristic information about the mechanical behaviour and properties of the respiratory system.

Risk factors for hydrocortisone Myopathy_HP in Status_asthmaticus_HP.In one hospital over a 15-month period, four out of nine patients ventilated for Status_asthmaticus_HP developed Acute_HP hydrocortisone Myopathy_HP. All patients had received less than 1.0 g day-1 hydrocortisone. Affected_HP patients had Severe_HP Generalized_HP_muscle_weakness_HP which recovered over 1-6 weeks. When myopathic and Unaffected_HP subjects were compared, there was no clearcut difference with respect to age, sex, types of drug used, serum potassium levels, duration of ventilation and muscle Paralysis_HP, total dose of vecuronium bromide, or mean daily doses of hydrocortisone. The main difference between the two groups was in the total doses of hydrocortisone. The myopathic patients all received greater than 5.0 g hydrocortisone (range 5.4-10.2 g) and the others less than 4.0 g (range 0.9-3.5 g). The possibility that neuromuscular blockade might predispose to the development of Myopathy_HP is discussed. Hydrocortisone Myopathy_HP can occur when less than 1.0 g day-1 is used, and even with as little as 5.4 g given over 6 days.

[Isocyanate-induced respiratory tract diseases in Switzerland].From 1980 to 1986 the Swiss National Accident Insurance Company (SUVA) recognized isocyanate-induced airway diseases as an occupational illness in 245 cases, which are presented retrospectively. Since isocyanates are widely used they are found at a large variety of workplaces. At present, isocyanates are the most Frequent_HP cause of occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in the Swiss industrial field. After complete avoidance of any further exposure respiratory symptoms persisted or airway obstruction could still be documented in one third of patients. An unfavourable prognosis is significantly associated with the following factors: (1) bronchial obstruction (FEVl/VC) at first pulmonary function test; (2) RAST positive for isocyanates; (3) long latency period between Onset_HP_of_Symptoms_ASDPTO and end of exposure. Therefore, individuals with isocyanate-induced airway diseases must be immediately removed from any further exposure to these substances.

Use of a management plan for treating Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in an emergency department.A standardised management protocol has been developed for the assessment and treatment of adults with Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attending an emergency department. The management protocol consists of an assessment sheet for recording essential features of the history and examination findings and a flow diagram with guidelines for initial management that were based on spirometric recordings. The protocol was introduced at Wellington Hospital in 1986. The effect of this intervention was assessed by analysing emergency department records during the three months before and one year after the introduction of the protocol. The use of the assessment sheet improved history taking and led to the increased use of serial measures of airflow obstruction and improved documentation of follow up arrangements. The provision of management guidelines influenced the emphasis of management, including an increased use of corticosteroids intravenously and more Frequent_HP use of an additional dose of nebulised bronchodilator. In the light of the initial experience the protocol has been modified and its use either in an emergency department or in general practice is recommended.

Reactive dye induced occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP without nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivity.Current Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is often Excluded_HP by the presence of normal bronchial hyperresponsiveness. We report two asthmatic patients with normal bronchial hyperresponsiveness and one asthmatic patient with Mild_HP bronchial hyperresponsiveness (methacholine PC20; 24 mg/ml) which was presumed to be caused by sensitization and exposure to Black GR, the most Frequent_HP sensitizer among reactive dyes. They all complained of lower respiratory symptoms after work as well as at the workstation. The bronchoprovocation test with Black GR revealed isolated immediate bronchoconstrictions in all 3 patients and all had high specific IgE antibodies to Black GR-human serum albumin conjugate. After one worker continued at work for 3 days, he experienced a marked drop of methacholine PC20, and it returned to the pre-exposure level during 1 week. The other patient whose initial methacholine challenge was negative developed bronchial hyperresponsiveness on the first day after the dye bronchoprovocation, and returned to normal bronchial hyperresponsiveness on the third day. These findings suggested that patients with occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP caused by reactive dye may not always have bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine, and the screening program utilizing methacholine challenges may not always identify these patients.

Bakers' Asthma_ASDPTO_HP: prevalence and evaluation of immunotherapy with a wheat flour extract.One hundred thirty-nine bakers and pastry cooks were included in a prevalence study of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to wheat flour demonstrated by skin tests, specific IgE to wheat flour (RAST), and inhalation challenge. From the sensitized workers, we selected 30 asthmatic patients. Twenty patients were treated with a standardized wheat flour extract, and ten with a placebo in a double-blind clinical trial. Before and after immunotherapy we performed tests in vivo (skin tests with wheat flour and methacholine tests), and in vitro (total IgE and specific IgE to wheat flour). We found substantial prevalence of wheat flour Allergy_HP (25.17% of workers), and a significant decrease (P less than .001) in hyperresponsiveness to methacholine, skin sensitivity (P = .002), and specific IgE (P less than .005) to wheat flour after 20 months of immunotherapy. There was also significant subjective improvement (P less than .001). The placebo group showed no changes in these variables.

Oral gold therapy in steroid-dependent Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, Nasal_polyposis_HP, and aspirin hypersensitivity.Eight patients are described who fulfill the criteria for the triad of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, Nasal_polyposis_HP, and aspirin hypersensitivity who have been treated with oral chrysotherapy from 7 to 17 months. Patient diary and symptom scores reflect an overall improvement in global symptoms. Monthly pulmonary assessment (spirometry) does not indicate a significant change (improvement or deterioration) but average daily oral prednisone requirements have decreased. One of eight patients experienced a minor side effect of treatment but did not require discontinuation of therapy. Oral gold therapy may prove to be an alternative therapy in a select population of patients and permit a reduction or discontinuation of oral corticosteroid therapy.

Effect of exercise on complement activity.Complement measurements of C1, C1q, C2, C3, C4, C5; the anaphylatoxins, C3a, C4a, and C5a; and total hemolytic activity of the classical and alternative pathways were made in 26 experienced adult runners before and after shortterm aerobic exercise. The baseline results were compared with those of nonexercising age-matched controls. In most subjects tested, running resulted in nanogram increases in C3a and C4a with corresponding decreases in the hemolytic activity of C4 (C4H). Baseline values of C3 and C4H were decreased significantly in runners when compared with nonexercising controls. Preliminary studies measuring the effect of exercise on C3a levels were also done in three asthmatic runners. Mean resting and postexercise levels, and exercise-induced increases in C3a anaphylatoxin in the asthmatic subjects were significantly higher than in the nonasthmatic subjects. The findings indicate that short-term exercise results in the activation of C3 and C4 and subsequent generation of C3a and C4a anaphylatoxins, and suggest that both activation of the classical pathway of complement and a selective downregulation of C3 production may occur in persons regularly engaged in aerobic exercise. The exaggerated generation of C3a by asthmatic subjects during exercise raises the possibility that anaphylatoxins play an etiologic role in Exercise-induced_Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Endogenous opioids modulate the increase in ventilatory output and Dyspnea_HP during Severe_HP Acute_HP bronchoconstriction.The aim of this study was to evaluate whether endogenous opioids are involved in the regulation of breathing pattern and respiratory drive during bronchoconstriction induced by methacholine (MCh). We studied six male asymptomatic asthmatics 18 to 35 yr of age. In a preliminary study we determined the concentration of MCh causing a 60% fall in FEV1 (PC60 FEV1). On two subsequent days, we measured breathing pattern, Dyspnea_HP sensation (Borg scale), mouth occlusion pressure (P0.1), and FEV1 before and 10 min after an intravenous injection of either naloxone (0.1 mg/kg) or saline according to a randomized double-blind crossover design. A MCh concentration equal to the PC60 FEV1 was then inhaled, and measurements were repeated 5 min later. Neither placebo nor naloxone Affected_HP baseline breathing pattern, P0.1, and FEV1. Naloxone pretreatment did not influence airway response to MCh; the mean percent fall in FEV1 was 65.9 +/- 1.3 and 64.7 +/- 1.2% (mean +/- 1 SE) on the placebo day and the naloxone day, respectively. After MCh inhalation no significant changes in VE, VT, and breathing Frequency_HP occurred when patients received placebo. However, P0.1 increased from 1.48 +/- 0.17 to 3.43 +/- 0.70 cm H2O (p less than 0.05), and VT/TI fell from 0.66 +/- 0.08 to 0.52 +/- 0.04 L/s (p less than 0.05). Naloxone pretreatment resulted in an increase in breathing Frequency_HP (from 18.2 +/- 1.7 to 22.8 +/- 2.6 breaths/min; p less than 0.05) and VT/TI (from 0.58 +/- 0.06 to 0.74 +/- 0.05 L/s; p less than 0.05) after MCh.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Endogenous opioids modulate the increase in ventilatory output and dyspnea during severe acute bronchoconstriction.The aim of this study was to evaluate whether endogenous opioids are involved in the regulation of breathing pattern and respiratory drive during bronchoconstriction induced by methacholine (MCh). We studied six male asymptomatic asthmatics 18 to 35 yr of age. In a preliminary study we determined the concentration of MCh causing a 60% fall in FEV1 (PC60 FEV1). On two subsequent days, we measured breathing pattern, dyspnea sensation (Borg scale), mouth occlusion pressure (P0.1), and FEV1 before and 10 min after an intravenous injection of either naloxone (0.1 mg/kg) or saline according to a randomized double-blind crossover design. A MCh concentration equal to the PC60 FEV1 was then inhaled, and measurements were repeated 5 min later. Neither placebo nor naloxone affected baseline breathing pattern, P0.1, and FEV1. Naloxone pretreatment did not influence airway response to MCh; the mean percent fall in FEV1 was 65.9 +/- 1.3 and 64.7 +/- 1.2% (mean +/- 1 SE) on the placebo day and the naloxone day, respectively. After MCh inhalation no significant changes in VE, VT, and breathing frequency occurred when patients received placebo.

The effect of repetitive exercise on airway temperatures.To determine if a relationship exists between intra-airway thermal events and the reduction in pulmonary mechanics that occur in asthmatics when they perform repetitive exercise, we recorded intrathoracic airstream temperatures in seven subjects during and after two identical bouts of cycle ergometry performed 30 min apart. From these data, global and regional thermal energy exchanges were calculated. Inspired air conditions, work loads, and minute ventilations were held constant for both trials. Pulmonary mechanics were measured prior to and serially after each challenge. As expected, the second provocation produced a smaller response than did the first. In association with these mechanical changes, the second challenge also produced less airway cooling and slower rewarming in the Central_HP airways. Hence, repetitive exercise trials performed over short intervals attenuate the essential thermal gradients necessary to produce obstruction. To the extent that these differences in intra-airway temperature reflect changes in perfusion, our data raise the possibility that the responsivity of the bronchial microcirculation of asthmatics may be altered by repetitive exercise.

Effect of long-term treatment with an inhaled corticosteroid (budesonide) on airway hyperresponsiveness and clinical Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in nonsteroid-dependent asthmatics.Several short-term studies have shown that inhaled steroids can reduce airway hyper-responsiveness in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. To evaluate whether Prolonged_HP treatment can bring about full recovery, this double-blind, randomized, controlled trial examined the effect of budesonide, 400 micrograms daily for 1 yr, on airway hyperresponsiveness. The time course and characteristics of improvements and associated changes in clinical Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Severity_HP were also evaluated. Thirty-two Stable_HP adult asthmatics, requiring bronchodilators alone, were selected. Before and monthly throughout the study, airway responsiveness to methacholine was measured and clinical Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Severity_HP assessed by questionnaire, daily bronchodilator use, and number of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP exacerbations. Patients receiving budesonide showed a fourfold mean improvement in airway responsiveness compared with those receiving placebo (p less than 0.0005), whose responsiveness remained very Stable_HP. Fifteen of the 16 budesonide subjects improved and 5 returned to the normal range. Largest improvements occurred during the first 3 months but, in some, were still progressing slowly at 1 yr. Improvements in responsiveness were accompanied by significant improvements in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP symptoms, bronchodilator use, and number of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP exacerbations. The results show that regular, Prolonged_HP use of inhaled steroid can produce marked improvements in airway hyperresponsiveness, sometimes with full resolution, and these improvements are accompanied by clinically significant improvements in clinical Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Quantitation of mast cells and eosinophils in the bronchial mucosa of symptomatic atopic asthmatics and Healthy_HP control subjects using immunohistochemistry.We have used fiberoptic bronchoscopy to obtain endobronchial biopsies in which mast cells and eosinophils were enumerated using monoclonal antibodies directed against mast cell tryptase (AA1) and the eosinophil cationic protein (EG2). Eleven symptomatic atopic asthmatics treated with beta 2-agonists alone and six normal subjects were studied. Over a period of 2 wk prior to bronchoscopy, patients recorded Asthma_ASDPTO_HP symptom scores, bronchodilator usage, and twice-daily peak expiratory flow. Five days before bronchoscopy, methacholine responsiveness was assessed. Two biopsies were taken from the subcarinae, one of which was processed into araldite for immunostaining by the streptavidin biotin immunoperoxidase method and the other into Spurr resin for electron microscopy. The number of AA1 staining mast cells present in the bronchial mucosa was not significantly different in the epithelium or submucosa between the asthmatic and the normal subjects. However, in the biopsies from asthmatics, there were significantly greater numbers of EG2-staining eosinophils in the epithelium (median, 1.2/mm versus zero; p less than 0.005) and in the submucosa (median, 50/mm2 versus 1/mm2; p less than 0.001). Electron microscopy showed morphologic features of mast cell and eosinophil degranulation in the asthmatics. No correlation could be established between mast cell or eosinophil numbers and indices of disease activity of PC20 methacholine, which points to the complexity of mechanisms responsible for the symptoms and the airway hyperresponsiveness of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Anti IgE-induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in guinea pigs; a new model for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Physiological and pathological studies.We established an experimental animal model for IgE-mediated Asthma_ASDPTO_HP by the use of intravenous injection of rabbit anti guinea pig IgE in normal guinea pigs. The degree of asthmatic airway obstruction was quantitatively estimated by Mead's apparatus which enabled us to use unanesthetized guinea pigs. With the injection of anti IgE, only an early asthmatic response was observed. Inhalation of anti IgE did not trigger Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Histo-pathological changes in the lung obtained immediately after the injection of anti IgE resembled those reported in human Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. This system may be used for pathological and pharmacological studies of the IgE-dependent early asthmatic response.

[The relationship between respiratory threshold to acetylcholine and prognosis for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].Forty nine asthmatic children were studied to clarify the relationship between the respiratory threshold of acetylcholine (RT-Ach) and the prognosis for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. In those patients who had asthmatic attacks fewer than 60 days in the last year, there was a statistically significant relationship between RT-Ach and the number of the days of asthmatic attacks over the 6 and 12 month periods following the inhalation test. In the younger group (5-11 years old), there was a statistically significant relationship between RT-Ach and the number of the days of asthmatic attacks over the 6 and 12 month periods following the inhalation test. However, in the elder group (12-15 years old), no such relationship was recognized. In the elder group, the obstructive index, one of the indices of flow-volume curve, had a statistically significant correlation with the number of asthmatic attacks over the 6 and 12 month periods following the inhalation test. However in the younger group, no such relationship was recognized.

[Antigen-induced biphasic eosinophil infiltration in the airways of actively sensitized guinea pigs and its inhibition by PAF antagonist and cyclosporin A].Bronchial Eosinophilia_HP is a characteristic of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. To elucidate the mechanisms of eosinophil accumulation in the airways, the time course of eosinophil infiltration in the airway mucosa after antigen inhalation was examined in actively sensitized and passively sensitized guinea pig models of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The lungs and tracheae were removed at intervals after antigen challenge, fixed and stained. The eosinophil infiltration was quantitated in the tracheal walls by counting the number of cells per square millimeter. Guinea pigs sensitized by intraperitoneal injection of ovalbumin (OA) responded to a single exposure to aerosolized OA with biphasic infiltration of eosinophils in the tracheal walls; a striking early-phase which peaked at 6 hr and a delayed-phase which peaked at 24 hr and persisted for as long as 5 days. These kinetics were different from those observed with passively sensitized animals which showed only early-phase infiltration. Administration of CV-6209, a specific PAF antagonist, before and 12 hrs after antigen challenge significantly (p less than 0.01) inhibited the early-phase but not the delayed-phase eosinophil infiltration in actively sensitized animals. In contrast, when guinea pigs were treated with Cyclosporin A, a T lymphocyte-selective immunosuppressive agent, throughout the immunization period, the delayed-phase but not the early-phase infiltration was significantly (p less than 0.01) inhibited. These results suggest that PAF may contribute to early-phase and T cell factor(s) may contribute to delayed-phase eosinophil infiltration of the airways.

Lack of airway response to nasal irritation in normal and asthmatic subjects.Twenty two subjects (10 normals, nine asthmatics and three who had suggestive histories for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP but normal bronchial histamine challenges) underwent nasal challenges with logarithmic incremental doses of histamine or saline on alternate days. Nasal resistance (measured by posterior rhinometry), and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) were assessed after each dose of nasal histamine or placebo. After each nasal challenge (maximum nasal dose of 250 micrograms of histamine or doubling of nasal resistance) bronchial responsiveness was measured with a bronchial histamine challenge. Despite significant changes in nasal resistance with nasal histamine (p less than 0.01) there was no significant change in the forced expiratory volume in one second, or in bronchial responsiveness. We were unable to demonstrate nasobronchial reflexes initiated by Acute_HP irritation of the nasal mucosa with histamine in either normal subjects or in those with Mild_HP to Moderate_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

A controlled trial of nebulized isoetharine in the prehospital treatment of Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is a potentially life-threatening disorder, recognizable to the prehospital care provider. While therapies are available to the prehospital care provider for treating Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, no previous controlled studies have been performed demonstrating the treatment in the field is efficacious and safe. The authors conducted a controlled trial of the prehospital use of nebulized isoetharine in an urban emergency medical services system. Fifty-two patients with Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were studied. Patients were initially evaluated with a peak flow meter. Half of the patients received isoetharine, while the control group received basic life support only. There was no difference in baseline values. Peak expiratory flow increased from 138 L/min to 148 L/min in the control group, while it increased from 149 L/min to 218 L/min in the treatment group (P less than .001). The authors conclude that paramedic treatment of Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP with nebulized isoetharine is effective in improving pulmonary function and clinical status during transport.

Myofibroblasts and subepithelial fibrosis in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.A thickened bronchial epithelial basement membrane has long been regarded as a histopathologic characteristic of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. As we had previously demonstrated that this phenomenon is due to the deposition of interstitial collagens and fibronectin, we have now sought to determine the nature of the cell responsible for this process by studying endobronchial biopsies from eight normal and seven Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic volunteers by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. Biopsies were stained with PR 2D3, a monoclonal antibody to myofibroblasts of the pericrypt sheath of the colon and a monoclonal antibody to alpha-smooth muscle actin. The thickness of the subepithelial collagen and the organelle content of the cells therein were determined by electron microscopy. The subepithelial collagen thickness in the normal subjects ranged from 2.16 to 6.26 microns, while that in the Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic subjects ranged from 3.75 to 11.1 microns (Mann-Whitney test; P = 0.05). Elongated cells in the collagen layer were identified by staining with PR 2D3. As this antibody also stains smooth muscle, consecutive frozen sections were stained for alpha-smooth muscle actin and the number of positive cells per millimeter of basement membrane was subtracted from the count for PR 2D3. This yielded a count of 4.9 to 9.4 cells/mm in the normal subjects and 11.9 to 20.6 cells/mm in the Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics (P = 0.001). There was a highly significant correlation between the depth of subepithelial collagen and the number of PR 2D3-positive, alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive cells (Spearman rank correlation; r = 0.764 and P = 0.006). Electron microscopy confirmed the myofibroblastic nature of these cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Nitrendipine therapy in asthmatic subjects.Nitrendipine was given to eight patients with Chronic_HP Stable_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP prior to a histamine challenge study and compared in a double-blind cross-over fashion with placebo. There were no significant differences in either the bronchoconstrictor effects of histamine, or in oxygen saturation during the histamine challenges, suggesting that nitrendipine should be safely tolerated if used to treat Hypertension_HP in patients with airflow obstruction.

Treatment of the asthmatic child.At the end of 1983 the outpatient clinic at the National Children's Hospital in San José, Costa Rica, adopted a new program for treating children with asthmatic crises. Use of adrenaline was discontinued, and administration of salbutamol in aerosol and short courses of corticosteroids was introduced; also, a special outpatient room was set aside for treating pediatric Asthma_ASDPTO_HP cases. Between 1984 and 1986 this program's marked superiority was demonstrated by many developments--including reduction of both initial Hospitalizations_ASDPTO and readmissions for pediatric Asthma_ASDPTO_HP by nearly 70%.

[Possibilities of measurement of obstruction in Status_asthmaticus_HP].Basic treatment of Status_asthmaticus_HP comprises among others the use of artificial pulmonary ventilation with all advantages and risks. The authors tried to express objectively the extent of obstruction of the airways from the relationship of ventilation parameters obtained from a display unit of Siemens Elema 900C ventilator and the period of intubation. Based on the investigated parameters, the inspiration pressure, the median intrathoracic pressure and pulmonary compliance, they assessed the correlation coefficient, using a computer. The value of the coefficient is postulated as the extent of obstruction. It can be also used for evaluation of the therapeutic effect and as a prognostic factor.

Monitoring glucocorticoid therapy: a pharmacokinetic approach.Although glucocorticoid therapy is essential for the treatment of Severe_HP inflammatory disorders, there is no systematic approach to patient variables that may Affect_ASDPTO availability of a steroid dose. After the development of a data base of pharmacokinetic parameters, we examined glucocorticoid pharmacokinetics in 54 patients between 2 and 70 years of age using 70 pharmacokinetic studies after administration of intravenous methylprednisolone (n = 25), oral methylprednisolone (n = 15), intravenous prednisolone (n = 18), and oral prednisone (n = 12). Eleven patients had unusually rapid methylprednisolone elimination (clearance, 565 to 837 ml/min/1.73 m2; population mean, [+/- SD] 380 +/- 100 ml/min/1.73 m2) without an identifiable cause. Incomplete absorption of methylprednisolone and prednisone was observed in three patients and one patient, respectively. Evaluation of glucocorticoid pharmacokinetics in children aged 1 year 8 months to 18 years demonstrated a significant inverse correlation (r = 0.88; p less than 0.001) between prednisolone clearance and age. It is therefore important to consider age in the interpretation of pharmacokinetic data. To simplify measurement of prednisolone clearance, a single-dose single-point method was developed. This was based on a highly significant relationship between the 6-hour postdose prednisolone concentration and prednisolone clearance (log prednisolone clearance = 2.66 + [6-hour postdose concentration] [-0.00167]; r2 = 0.96; p less than 0.0001). Evaluation of glucocorticoid pharmacokinetics in the clinical setting can be used to identify abnormalities in absorption, elimination, and patient compliance. This technique can be used to individualize glucocorticoid dosing regimens.

Comparison of aerosolized glycopyrrolate and metaproterenol in Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The efficacy of nebulized glycopyrrolate compared with metaproterenol was evaluated in 46 patients with Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. In a double-blinded, randomized fashion, patients received, as sole therapy, either 2 mg of glycopyrrolate or 15 mg of metaproterenol every 2 h over a 6-h study period. Of the 35 patients completing the study, analysis of variance demonstrated no difference in percentage of change in FEV1 between glycopyrrolate and metaproterenol. Two hours after the initial dose, there was a 30 percent increase in FEV1 for glycopyrrolate compared with a 25 percent increase for metaproterenol (p greater than 0.05, NS). In contrast to the comparable bronchodilator activity, the side effects profile of the two agents were markedly dissimilar. Not only were subjective complaints of Tremor_HP, Palpitations_HP, and Paresthesia_HP increased for metaproterenol, but the heart rate response was significantly elevated (p less than 0.05) compared with glycopyrrolate. Based on these data, administration of the aerosolized anticholinergic agent, glycopyrrolate, is a reasonable therapeutic alternative for Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

[Sulfur dioxide-induced bronchial constriction in Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics and its prophylaxis by salbutamol].Patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP often develop Acute_HP attack in kitchen while burning honeycomb briquet which is widely used for cooking in southern China. Burning of a honeycomb briquet produces 0.6-4.3 ppm sulphur dioxide (SO2) in the kitchen air. To assess whether the above concentration of SO2 can induce bronchial constriction, we performed SO2 bronchial provocation test on 21 Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics (male 11, female 10, average age 28.8 +/- 2.0 years), 10 patients with Allergic_Rhinitis_HP (male 3, female 7.28 +/- 1.6 years) and 20 Healthy_HP non-smokers (male 13, female 7, 28.1 +/- 1.5 years). FEV1 showed no significant change in both Healthy_HP and Rhinitis_HP group even a maximal amount of SO2 (10 ppm) was given. The calculated PC20 FEV1 and PC35 SGaW in Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics were 3.7 +/- 0.22 ppm and 2.5 +/- 0.18 ppm respectively, which fell into the SO2 range yielded by a burning honeycomb briquet. Orally administered slow release salbutamol created protective effect in 5 out of 8 patients. Salbutamol inhalation, however, completely blocked SO2 induced bronchial constriction. We suggest that patient with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP should receive salbutamol aerosol inhalation before cooking with burning honeycomb briquet.

Burning of a honeycomb briquet produces 0.6-4.3 ppm sulphur dioxide (SO2) in the kitchen air. To assess whether the above concentration of SO2 can induce bronchial constriction, we performed SO2 bronchial provocation test on 21 asthmatics (male 11, female 10, average age 28.8 +/- 2.0 years), 10 patients with allergic rhinitis (male 3, female 7.28 +/- 1.6 years) and 20 healthy non-smokers (male 13, female 7, 28.1 +/- 1.5 years). FEV1 showed no significant change in both healthy and rhinitis group even a maximal amount of SO2 (10 ppm) was given. The calculated PC20 FEV1 and PC35 SGaW in asthmatics were 3.7 +/- 0.22 ppm and 2.5 +/- 0.18 ppm respectively, which fell into the SO2 range yielded by a burning honeycomb briquet. Orally administered slow release salbutamol created protective effect in 5 out of 8 patients. Salbutamol inhalation, however, completely blocked SO2 induced bronchial constriction.

Ketotifen. A review of its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, and therapeutic use in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and allergic disorders.Ketotifen is an orally active prophylactic agent for the management of bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and allergic disorders. Accumulated evidence indicates that after 6 to 12 weeks of administration, ketotifen significantly reduces respiratory symptoms and the need for concomitant antiasthmatic drugs in about 70% and 50%, respectively, of patients with Mild_HP to Moderate_HP bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. However, absolute improvement in lung function is generally slight. Ketotifen also has pronounced antihistaminic and antianaphylactic properties which result in Moderate_HP to marked symptom improvement in the majority of patients with Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP, seasonal or perennial Rhinitis_HP, Allergic_Conjunctivitis_HP, Chronic_HP or Acute_HP Urticaria_HP or Food_Allergy_HP. Comparative trials with established agents--notably sodium cromoglycate (cromolyn sodium) in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and histamine H1-antagonists in allergic disorders--indicate that ketotifen has comparable clinical utility. Unlike inhaled sodium cromoglycate, ketotifen ameliorates the symptoms of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, Rhinitis_HP and Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP when present together in atopic patients. Patient acceptance of ketotifen is good, although sedation can be troublesome in older children and adults for the initial 2 weeks of treatment. Increased_body_weight_HP is another notable effect in a small percentage of patients. Thus, ketotifen appears to be a useful agent for the management of allergic disorders and bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, particularly in patients for whom oral therapy is preferred. Although a lengthy run-in period is needed in the treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, in those patients who respond, continued reduction in the Frequency_HP and Severity_HP of symptoms and in the use of additional antiasthmatic drugs can be anticipated.

Controlled-release theophylline in the treatment of Nocturnal_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.A total of 104 asthmatic patients with symptoms of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and/or a 'morning dip' in the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) who were receiving multiple therapies, including inhaled or oral steroids, were treated in addition once nightly with controlled-release theophylline in an 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study. Theophylline produced an improvement in symptoms of Cough_HP, wheeze, Sleep_disturbance_HP and PEFR in the 73 completing patients compared to run-in and placebo treatment. Theophylline also produced an improvement in the forced expiratory volume in 1 s and forced vital capacity relative to baseline, and in the difference between actual and predicted PEFR values. Nausea_HP was the most Frequent_HP side-effect but both patients' and investigator's global impressions of the effect of study medication were in favour of theophylline.

Twin concordance for a binary trait: III. A bivariate analysis of Allergic_rhinitis_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Self-reported histories of Allergic_rhinitis_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were obtained from 3,808 pairs of adult twins 18 years and over registered with the Australian National Health Medical Research Council Twin Registry (1232 MZF, 567 MZM, 751 DZF, 352 DZM, 906 DZO). The prevalence of Allergic_rhinitis_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was 0.32 and 0.13, respectively, with little variation with zygosity, sex, and age. The associations between twin pairs for these two traits were analysed, under the assumption of constant prevalences, as a special case of a log-linear model for binary traits in pedigrees using the statistical package GLIM. The model assumption that there are no second- or higher-order interactions was tested in the 2 X 2 X 2 X 2 table of twin by disease outcomes without revealing strong evidence of departure, even in this large data set. The log-linear modelling showed that only three first-order interactions, namely 1) between Allergic_rhinitis_HP in a twin pair, 2) Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in a twin pair, and 3) Allergic_rhinitis_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in the same twin, were necessary to describe the data. The first two interaction terms were significantly larger in identical pairs; the third was independent of zygosity. Under this parsimonious model, there was a significant difference between identical and fraternal pairs in marginal correlation, both in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Allergic_rhinitis_HP, and in the cross-correlation between Allergic_rhinitis_HP in one twin and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in the other. This suggests that genetic factors are implicated in both Allergic_rhinitis_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and that some of these genetic factors are common (at least among a subgroup of individuals) to both traits.
Twin concordance for a binary trait: III. A bivariate analysis of hay fever and asthma.Self-reported histories of hay fever and asthma were obtained from 3,808 pairs of adult twins 18 years and over registered with the Australian National Health Medical Research Council Twin Registry (1232 MZF, 567 MZM, 751 DZF, 352 DZM, 906 DZO). The prevalence of hay fever and asthma was 0.32 and 0.13, respectively, with little variation with zygosity, sex, and age.

The spectrum of the symptoms and presentations of Gastroesophageal_reflux_HP.The symptoms and presentations of Gastroesophageal_reflux_HP are rather numerous. These include the typical symptoms, such as Gastroesophageal_reflux_HP, regurgitation, water brash, or Dysphagia_HP. However, reflux may also be responsible for such symptoms as Hoarse_voice_HP, Aspiration_HP, or Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. It may also be an important cause of noncardiac Chest_Pain_ASDPTO_HP. Thus, Gastroesophageal_reflux_HP may be considered a disease with more than just "esophageal" symptoms.

Complications of reflux Esophagitis_HP and their medical management.It is shortsighted to consider only the esophageal manifestations and complications of esophageal reflux. That such reflux can directly Affect_ASDPTO not only the lung but also the oropharynx and larynx, both by direct acid contact and reflex neurologic mechanisms, has been demonstrated repeatedly. The task of the future will be to place such reflux into perspective as it remains only one of many genetic and environmental factors associated with disparate and often confusing disease processes.

Effect of sleep and sleep deprivation on ventilatory response to bronchoconstriction.To characterize ventilatory responses to bronchoconstriction during sleep and to assess the effect of prior sleep deprivation on ventilatory and arousal responses to bronchoconstriction, bronchoconstriction was induced in eight asthmatic subjects while they were awake, during normal sleep, and during sleep after a 36-h period of sleep deprivation. Each subject was bronchoconstricted with increasing concentrations of aerosolized methacholine while ventilatory patterns and lower airway resistance (Rla) were continually monitored. The asthmatic patients maintained their minute ventilation as Rla increased under all conditions, demonstrating a Stable_HP tidal volume with a Mild_HP increase in respiratory Frequency_HP. Inspiratory drive, as measured by occlusion pressure (P0.1), increased progressively and significantly as Rla increased under all conditions (slopes of P0.1 vs. Rla = 0.249, 0.112, and 0.154 for awake, normal sleep, and sleep after sleep deprivation, respectively, P less than 0.0006). Chemostimuli did not appear to contribute significantly to the observed increases in P0.1. Prior sleep deprivation had no effect on ventilatory and P0.1 responses to bronchoconstriction but did significantly raise the arousal threshold to induced bronchoconstriction. We conclude that ventilatory responses to bronchoconstriction, unlike extrinsic loading, are not imparied by the presence of sleep, nor are they chemically mediated. However, prior sleep deprivation does increase the subsequent arousal threshold.

Prevalence of occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and immunologic sensitization to guar gum among employees at a carpet-manufacturing plant.Guar gum is a high-molecular-weight agent that can cause occupational Rhinitis_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. We surveyed the employees at a carpet-manufacturing plant in which guar gum is used to adhere the dye to the fiber; 162/177 of the employees (92%) participated in the first part of the survey that included a questionnaire and skin prick tests with common allergens and guar gum (1 mg/ml). IgE and IgG antibodies to guar gum were also measured in those subjects (133/162 or 82%) who agreed to blood tests. Thirty-seven subjects (23%) had a history suggestive of occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and 59 (36%), of occupational Rhinitis_HP. Eight subjects (5%) demonstrated immediate skin reactivity to guar gum. Eleven subjects (8.3%) had serum IgE antibodies to guar gum. All subjects, except one subject who had a history suggestive of occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (n = 37) or positive skin tests (n = 4), participated in the second part of the study. A methacholine-inhalation test was performed during a workshift or in the 3 to 4 hours after the workshift. Five subjects had a concentration of methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 of less than 16 mg/ml (significant bronchial hyperresponsiveness) and positive skin reactions to guar gum. Four of these subjects underwent specific inhalation challenges. The remaining subject had a history of Severe_HP bronchospastic reaction on exposure to guar gum, and his FEV1 of 1.6 L made specific challenges impossible. Two subjects had typical isolated immediate reactions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Tryptase, a mediator of human mast cells.Tryptase, a mediator secreted by human mast cells during immediate reactions, has demonstrated effects on several pathways in vitro. This enzyme can rapidly inactivate fibrinogen and, as a complex with heparin, may prevent coagulation that may otherwise occur when plasma enters tissues at sites of immediate reactions. Tryptase may also activate prostromelysin, which in turn activates latent collagenase. When canine pulmonary smooth muscle is incubated with canine tryptase, the contractile response to histamine is increased. Tryptase, quantifiable in complex biologic fluids by immunoassay, can serve as a specific indicator of mast cell involvement in certain clinical settings. For example, after bee sting--induced Anaphylactic_shock_HP, tryptase levels in the blood peak at approximately 1 hour, then decline with a half-life of approximately 2 hours. Additionally, elevated tryptase levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of asymptomatic, atopic persons with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP suggest ongoing mast cell activation, which may relate to adenosine hyperresponsiveness and a persistence of bronchial hyperreactivity. Tryptase levels in bronchial lavage fluid of atopic patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP rise markedly after endobronchial allergen challenge but not after an exercise challenge, suggesting a lack of mast cell involvement in the latter condition.

It is children with Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP who develop Asthma_ASDPTO_HP more frequently if the mother smokes.We elicited symptoms of Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP (AD) and of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP from 620 children who were themselves nonsmokers, were aged 1 to 17 years, and had been consecutively referred to an Allergy_HP clinic. A histamine bronchial-challenge test revealed bronchial hyperresponsiveness in 95% of the children who had a history of Wheezing_HP or Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and who could perform the test reliably, indicating that most of them did indeed have Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Children with a history of AD were much more likely to have Asthma_ASDPTO_HP if the mother was a smoker than if she was a nonsmoker (79% versus 52%; p = 0.001). Similarly, if AD was found on examination, the percentages with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were 74% and 44%, respectively. By contrast, the children with no history of AD had Asthma_ASDPTO_HP as frequently if the mother was a nonsmoker (42%) as when she was a smoker (40%). In children with AD, the prevalence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was greater in both boys and girls when the mother was a smoker, but only in boys when the father was a smoker. Multiple logistic regression confirmed that the risk of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was greatly increased when the child had both AD and a mother who smoked.
It is children with atopic dermatitis who develop asthma more frequently if the mother smokes.We elicited symptoms of atopic dermatitis (AD) and of asthma from 620 children who were themselves nonsmokers, were aged 1 to 17 years, and had been consecutively referred to an allergy clinic. A histamine bronchial-challenge test revealed bronchial hyperresponsiveness in 95% of the children who had a history of wheezing or asthma and who could perform the test reliably, indicating that most of them did indeed have asthma.

Salsalate cross-sensitivity in aspirin-sensitive patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Ten aspirin (ASA)-sensitive patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP underwent double-blind, placebo-controlled oral challenges with salsalate followed by ASA-sensitive confirmatory challenges. All 10 patients sustained asthmatic reactions to ASA, but only two developed respiratory reactions to 2 gm of salsalate. In these two patients, repeat confirmatory challenges with 2 gm of salsalate reproduced the same asthmatic reactions. Both patients were desensitized to ASA, and cross-desensitization with 2 gm of salsalate was then achieved. We conclude that salsalate, a weak inhibitor of cyclooxygenase in vitro, is less likely than ASA to induce Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in known ASA-sensitive patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP but may occasionally cross-react in these patients. Such reactions were Mild_HP and easily treated with beta 2-agonists.

Immediate skin test reactivity to Food and Drug Administration-approved standardized extracts.In an effort to determine whether recently introduced Food and Drug Administration-approved standardized extracts produce clinically appropriate responses in a population, 200 subjects were skin prick tested (SPT). Thirteen extracts (10 pollens, two house dust (HD) mites and cat) were tested in three groups of subjects, 50 with a history of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP or Allergic_Rhinitis_HP (AL), 50 without Asthma_ASDPTO_HP or perennial or seasonal Allergic_Rhinitis_HP but with a positive immediate Family_history_HP for these conditions (FAL), and 100 subjects without a personal or Family_history_HP for these conditions (NAL). An SPT mean wheal diameter greater than or equal to 3 mm was considered positive. Ninety percent (95% confidence interval [CI], 82% to 98%) of AL subjects had at least one positive SPT. Forty-six percent of FAL subjects (95% CI, 30% to 58%) and 29% of NAL subjects (95% CI, 20% to 38%) had at least one positive SPT. More FAL than NAL subjects had at least one SPT (p less than 0.05), and FAL subjects had more positive SPTs than NAL subjects (p less than 0.05), further supporting the genetic regulation of allergen-specific IgE production. Of the five AL subjects with no SPT wheal greater than or equal to 3 mm, three subjects were available for intradermal tests. Thirteen nonstandardized allergens similar to allergens used for SPT were applied intradermally in each of these three subjects and were all negative. Compared with history, an SPT wheal greater than or equal to 3 mm to cat produced a sensitivity of 0.90, a specificity of 0.90, and diagnostic accuracy of 0.90. Tenfold dilutions of pollens and cat reduced sensitivity without significantly improving specificity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Forty-six percent of FAL subjects (95% CI, 30% to 58%) and 29% of NAL subjects (95% CI, 20% to 38%) had at least one positive SPT. More FAL than NAL subjects had at least one SPT (p less than 0.05), and FAL subjects had more positive SPTs than NAL subjects (p less than 0.05), further supporting the genetic regulation of allergen-specific IgE production. Of the five AL subjects with no SPT wheal greater than or equal to 3 mm, three subjects were available for intradermal tests. Thirteen nonstandardized allergens similar to allergens used for SPT were applied intradermally in each of these three subjects and were all negative. Compared with history, an SPT wheal greater than or equal to 3 mm to cat produced a sensitivity of 0.90, a specificity of 0.90, and diagnostic accuracy of 0.90. Tenfold dilutions of pollens and cat reduced sensitivity without significantly improving specificity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Mechanical ventilation in Status_asthmaticus_HP: experience with 75 episodes.Mechanical ventilation in 75 out of 560 Status_asthmaticus_HP episodes during a five-year period (1984-1988) at Chulalongkorn Hospital were analyzed. There were 58 patients with an average Onset_HP of first asthmatic attack of 18.5 years and an average age when requiring mechanical ventilation of 33 years, which is significantly younger than among those who did not require assisted ventilation. At the time of intubation, four patients were in sudden unexpected arrest and 19 patients were urgently ventilated because of respiratory Increased_muscle_fatiguability_HP or carbon dioxide narcosis; the remaining 52 patients required elective mechanical ventilation. The arterial blood gas of 52 patients revealed a pH of 7.11 +/- 0.66, PaCO2 of 58.0 +/- 5.5 mmHg, and HCO3 of 15.0 +/- 5.8 mEg/L. Controlled mechanical ventilation was maintained for a mean of 38.68 hours. Fifty-one patients required intravenous diazepam (average dose = 24.3 mg) and 37 required morphine (average dose = 11.1 mg) for good syncronization in controlling mechanical ventilation. Pneumothorax_HP was the most common complication with four, nine and one episodes occurring prior to, during and after assisted ventilation, respectively. Four, one and two patients developed the complications of Pneumonia_HP, Atelectasis_HP of the Left_HP lung due to mucous plugging and upper Gastrointestinal_hemorrhage_HP, respectively. There were six patients who died of complications: four of brain anoxia, one of Pneumothorax_HP and another of unexplained cause.

Endurance running performance in athletes with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Laboratory assessment was made during maximal and submaximal exercise on 16 endurance trained male runners with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (aged 35 +/- 9 years) (mean +/- S.D.). Eleven of these asthmatic athletes had recent performance times over a half-marathon, which were examined in light of the results from the laboratory tests. The maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) of the group was 61.8 +/- 6.3 ml kg-1 min-1 and the maximum ventilation (VEmax) was 138.7 +/- 24.7 l min-1. These maximum cardio-respiratory responses to exercise were positively correlated to the degree of airflow obstruction, defined as the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (expressed as a percentage of predicted normal). The half-marathon performance times of 11 of the athletes ranged from those of recreational to elite runners (82.4 +/- 8.8 min, range 69-94). Race pace was correlated with VO2max (r = 0.863, P less than 0.01) but the highest correlation was with the running velocity at a blood lactate concentration of 2 mmol l-1 (r = 0.971, P less than 0.01). The asthmatic athletes utilized 82 +/- 4% VO2max during the half-marathon, which was correlated with the %VO2max at 2 mmol l-1 blood lactate (r = 0.817, P less than 0.01). The results of this study suggest that athletes with Mild_HP to Moderate_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP can possess high VO2max values and can develop a high degree of endurance fitness, as defined by their ability to sustain a high percentage of VO2max over an endurance race. In athletes with more Severe_HP airflow obstruction, the maximum ventilation rate may be reduced and so VO2max may be impaired. The athletes in the present study have adapted to this limitation by being able to sustain a higher %VO2max before the accumulation of blood lactate, which is an advantage during an endurance race. Therefore, with appropriate training and medication, asthmatics can successfully participate in endurance running at a competitive level.

[123I-IMP accumulation in the lung with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP--early uptake and delayed washout].123I-IMP is taken up by the pulmonary capillary endothelial cells during the first pass through the lung, and is slowly released from them. To look up the factors which influence on the Prolonged_HP 123I-IMP retention in the diseased lung, we examined the correlation between the 123I-IMP uptake during the first pass and the 123I-IMP retention. Patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP had no abnormal finding in the chest X-ray photograph. However 123I-IMP release from their lungs was delayed. Some patients show a tendency that 123I-IMP uptake during the first pass was uneven, which suggested the change in amine uptake function of endothelial cells. However their correlation coefficients between the uptake during the first pass and the Prolonged_HP retention were very small. It was considered that the Prolonged_HP 123I-IMP retention in the diseased lung was not explained only by the change in uptake function of pulmonary capillary endothelial cell.

[Reproducibility of peak expiratory flow rate measured at home].In 8 Stable_HP patients with Chronic_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, the reproducibility of peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) measured and recorded 4 times per day for longer than 1 month at home and at work was assessed. Average %PEFRs of individuals through the periods observed were higher than 80%, and coefficients of variation were less than 10% regardless of the time measured. This suggested that a decrease in %PEFR more than 10% reflects early phase of deterioration of airways narrowing and Frequent_HP measurement of PEFR is essential for long-term management and for self-assessment of Chronic_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

[Asthma_ASDPTO_HP: Allergy_HP and inflammation. Principles of rational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP therapy].Improved concepts concerning the pathogenesis of Chronic_HP bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, the role of air pollutants, infections, and allergic reactions are the basis of established therapeutic principles and the development of new drugs: Allergens initiate long lasting inflammatory processes ("late phase reactions") in the bronchial system. This inflammation causes bronchial hyperreactivity and altered lung function. A large number of inflammatory cells and mediators are involved. Air pollutants and infections can act in the same way. Asthma_ASDPTO_HP treatment should focus in the inflammatory process, start early and prevent and treat both Chronic_HP inflammation and Acute_HP Bronchospasm_HP.

Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and its management at a student health service.Of 96 asthmatic students 62 said their Asthma_ASDPTO_HP had not required them to give up any activity but only seven said it had not interfered in some way with their sport. Thirty-nine regarded their Asthma_ASDPTO_HP as an annoyance and 13 of these were angered by it. Fifty-seven respondents took treatment continuously and the most favoured agent in attacks was salbutamol. Peak flow meters were not used regularly except by six students. About two-thirds had significant deficiencies in their knowledge of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and the most popular source of information was the general practitioner. Only 30 had read the Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Foundation pamphlets.

[Pollinosis and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP: pathogenesis, immunology, clinical aspects].Rhinoconjunctivitis induced by pollen exposure and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP are generally easily recognizable clinically. In Asthma_ASDPTO_HP a number of differential diagnoses such as Ciliary_Dyskinesia_HP, cystic fibrosis and gastro-oesophageal reflux must be considered. The predominant symptoms are Cough_HP and Wheezing_HP. Investigations into the complex nature of mediator release and IgE synthesis have established a predominantly inflammatory pattern of reactions largely responsible for induction and maintenance of bronchial hyperresponsiveness due to both Acute_HP and Chronic_HP processes. Future therapeutic consequences may be derived from anti-inflammatory strategies. This has already lead to reassessment and upgrading of use of corticosteroids in paediatric Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

[Therapy of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].Asthma_ASDPTO_HP stems from Chronic_HP inflammatory changes in the bronchial mucosa: its long-term treatment is mainly based on the antiinflammatory action of the employed substances. Topical (aerosol) treatment is considered as the most effective route of medication; availability of new substances and new aerosols in Austria requires a revision of previously established treatment strategies. Such revised strategies are presented for schoolchildren, babies and toddlers respectively; they follow the same principles, but differ in respect to the preferred method of topical medication. In addition, coexistent Allergy_HP has to be evaluated and treated on an individualized basis; occasionally, so-called "tertiary strategies" of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP treatment are employed as well.

Neurotic and psychosomatic disorders. Interdependence in terms of the search activity concept.There are no correlations between MMPI Hysteria (Hs) and Depression_ASDPTO (D) scales in psychosomatic patients in contrast to other patients with somatic disturbances, neurotic disturbances, and in Healthy_HP subjects. The roles of Depression_ASDPTO and hypochondria in the dynamics of psychosomatic disturbances are discussed according to the search activity concept. It is suggested that hypochondriacal complaints are prognostically favorable in comparison with Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP-Depression_ASDPTO complaints.

Prevalence of human Immunodeficiency_HP virus seropositivity in pediatric emergency room patients undergoing phlebotomy.Information on the prevalence of human Immunodeficiency_HP virus (HIV) infection among children and adolescents requiring medical care is sparse. A small but significant risk of seroconversion occurs in health care workers who handle blood and body fluids of patients infected with HIV. The prevalence of HIV seropositivity in children who had phlebotomy as part of emergency care was measured. Of 749 blood samples, 21 (2.8%) tested positive for HIV antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western Blot analysis: 14 samples from 6 patients with hemophilia, 6 from 3 patients with acquired Immunodeficiency_HP syndrome/acquired Immunodeficiency_HP syndrome-related complex, and 1 from a patient with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Of these 21 blood samples, 10 were from 4 children previously known to be HIV positive, 4 were from patients with a known parental risk factor, and 16 were from patients with known history of blood transfusion. One sample was from a children with unknown HIV status and no documented risk factors. Procedures included 9 venipunctures, 17 intravenous line placements, 1 lumbar puncture, and 1 pelvic examination. Most patients with HIV seropositivity had been known to be HIV seropositive or at significant risk for HIV seropositivity. Although the potential risk to health care workers from children without known risk factors for HIV seropositivity was small in this population, the currently recommended infection-control precautions should always be observed.

Microgenetic patterns of adaptation on the Stroop task by patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and duodenal Peptic_ulcer_HP.Microgenetic patterns of adaptation on the Stroop task were assessed by means of the Serial Color-Word Test given 21 patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and 20 with duodenal Peptic_ulcer_HP, who were compared with 41 normal controls matched for sex, age, and education. Two measures were calculated on each of the five trials of the test, one of linear change and one of nonlinear change in reading times. As predicted, patients presented more frequently patterns characterized by high nonlinear change and less frequently stabilized patterns (low linear and nonlinear change of reading speed). Linear and nonlinear change were then calculated on the five linear change scores and the five nonlinear change scores; again patients presented more frequently patterns characterized by high nonlinear change on both the linear change scores and nonlinear change scores and less frequently stabilized patterns. These findings indicate strong similarities between the adaptation patterns of patients with ulcer and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and the microgenetic patterns previously known to characterize neurotic and psychotic patients. Furthermore, scores on the Serial Color-Word Test also differentiated between ulcer and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP groups.

[Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in Allergic_Rhinitis_HP].The author diagnosed Cough_HP, Emphysema_HP and the symptoms characteristic for the bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in 43% of patients with Seasonal_Allergy_HP (Rhinitis_HP, Conjunctivitis_HP) to pollens. Such symptoms were more Frequent_HP (51% of cases) in patients allergic to the grass pollens with coexisting hypersensitivity to Compositae family. Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic symptoms in patients allergic only to grass pollens were seen in 38%. The author suggests that Prolonged_HP exposition in the inhalatory allergens (from two to four-five months) plays an important role in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Onset_HP in such patients. It rather delays than accelerates admittance to allergic clinics.

Dose-related effect of beclomethasone dipropionate on airway responsiveness in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The effects of twice daily inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) at two dose levels (500 and 1,000 micrograms daily) on the airway responsiveness to inhaled histamine was evaluated by a randomized, single-blind, cross-over study in 10 patients with Stable_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The 12-week study began with a 3-week run-in period of baseline treatment, which was continued unchanged throughout the study, and the two treatment periods were separated by a 3-week placebo period. Patients attended the laboratory every 3 weeks for spirometry and histamine inhalation tests to determine the provocative concentration of histamine causing a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (PC20 of FEV1). There was a similar significant improvement (p less than 0.05) in mean FEV1 after both treatments. There was no significant change in PC20 after treatment with 500 micrograms daily, the geometric mean being 0.587 mg/ml after the placebo period and 0.860 mg/ml after BDP treatment. There was a significant improvement in PC20 (1.930 mg/ml) after treatment with 1,000 micrograms BDP daily in comparison with the placebo and treatment periods with 500 micrograms BDP daily (p less than 0.001). These results suggest that higher doses than usual of inhaled BDP must be used to control airway responsiveness in asthmatics.

Severe_HP Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Pathophysiology, clinical assessment, and treatment.Bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is characterized as a disease with Recurrent_HP, reversible, and Generalized_HP airway obstruction and an increased airway responsiveness to nonspecific stimuli. Besides symptoms of airway hyperresponsiveness, Episodic_HP asthmatic attacks, and Chronic_HP airway obstruction, Severe_HP Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, or 'status asthmaticus', is an important and life-threatening manifestation of the disease. This paper gives an overview of the pathophysiology, clinical risk assessment, and treatment of Severe_HP Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

[The development of remission in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].The efficacy of the therapeutic programs and rehabilitation measures for achievement of a permanent remission of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was studied in 436 patients, 18 to 71 years of age (mean age 45.3 years), 283 women and 153 men. In 42.89% of the patients the Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was Severe_HP, in 47.07% it was Moderate_HP and in 10.09%--Mild_HP. 30.05% of the patients were with atopic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, 52.06%--with infectious dependence, 8.03%--with glucocorticoid deficiency and 2.98%--with hormonal Postural_instability_HP. In all patients remission was achieved with a different reliability. Full remission was achieved in 24.08%, partial remission 1 degree--in 58.03% and partial remission II degree--in 17.89% of the patients. The duration of the remission varied from 2 up to 46 months. A remission longer than 6 months was achieved in 72.10% of the patients treated with intal or zaditen, in 61.36% of the patients treated with corticosteroids and only in 27.70% of the patients treated with symptomatic and general hygienic means. The duration and the quality of the remission depend on the correct selection of the therapy in the Acute_HP stage, the Severity_HP and the form of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Better results are achieved in the Mild_HP form of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The most Frequent_HP causes for destabilization of the remission were bronchopulmonary infections, incorrect reduction or discontinuing of the medication, formal supportive therapy, psychologic demobilization and irrational supportive therapy.

Use of medical care and antibiotics among preschool children in different day care settings.The use of medical care among 880 1-5 year olds in different day care settings was studied using register information on physician visits, purchases of antibiotics and municipal day care in 1984. The unit of analysis was months in the different day care settings and not children. The rates of physician visits were 1.4 to 1.8 times higher for Acute_HP Recurrent_upper_respiratory_tract_infections_HP and all Acute_HP infections and 2 to 3 times higher for secretory Otitis_ASDPTO_media_HP during day care centre months and family day care months as compared to home care months. The rate of visits for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was 5 times higher during day care centre months than during home care months. No differences were found between day care centre months and family day care months with respect to the rates of physician visits for Acute_HP Recurrent_upper_respiratory_tract_infections_HP, Acute_HP Otitis_ASDPTO_media_HP and all Acute_HP infections. Among children in family day care, the daily number of hours in day care, and size, average age and age homogeneity of the groups were not significantly associated with rates of visits for all Acute_HP infections or purchases of antibiotics.

The role of measurements of airway responsiveness.In smokers with Chronic_HP airflow limitation (CAL), airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) to stimuli like methacholine, which act directly on airway smooth muscle, are not specific for the pathogenesis which is responsible for AHR to methacholine in subjects with normal spirometry, nor predictive for a beneficial effect of glucocorticosteroid (GCS) treatment. In contrast, AHR to stimuli like Hyperventilation_HP, which act indirectly through mediator release, may be specific for the pathogenesis of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and predictive for a beneficial effect of GCS. The validation of this possibility requires the demonstration that patients with CAL and AHR to hyper-ventilation demonstrate improvement after treatment with GCS (and have an increase in eosinophils and metachromatic cells in the sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), like that seen in asthmatics uncomplicated by CAL).

Airways hyperreactivity, bronchial inflammation and Obstructive_lung_disease_HP.Understanding the mechanisms responsible for the development of Chronic_HP airflow obstruction is very important since this disease is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States and it produces a significant economic and social burden for society. Since reversal of established airflow obstruction is not possible, it would appear that the best prognosis and therapeutic results can be obtained by early Diagnosis_ASDPTO and prevention of irreversible disease. Understanding the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms is necessary to detect susceptible individuals and develop effective interventions.

Clinical trials in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Chronic_HP airflow obstruction.Clinical trials are becoming increasingly important in objectively evaluating therapeutic interventions in pulmonary medicine. Although the overall methodology for clinical trials is similar for most diseases, there are specific questions and problems unique to pulmonary medicine. This review is limited to a discussion of the general design and commonly encountered "problems and pitfalls" for clinical trials in respiratory medicine. Three examples of designs for intervention in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Chronic_HP obstructive airways disease are presented.

Racial, social, and environmental risks for childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Unlike a number of childhood problems, it is not clear that there are racial or socioeconomic disparities in the prevalence of childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. We analyzed data from the Child Health Supplement to the 1981 National health Interview Survey, a population-based survey with information concerning 15,416 children, to address the following questions: are there racial or socioeconomic differences in rates of childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP; if yes, what is the contribution of social and environmental characteristics to the observed differences? In this sample, black children were more likely to have Asthma_ASDPTO_HP than were white children (4.4% vs. 2.5%). Racial disparities in prevalence emerged early and at all childhood ages were due to higher black rates of Onset_HP between the ages of 1 and 3 years. Poverty status, maternal cigarette Smoking_ASDPTO, large family size, smaller size of home, Small_for_gestational_age_HP, and maternal age younger than 20 years at the child's birth were all associated with increased rates of childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. When available social and environmental characteristics were controlled for using multivariate analyses, the increased risk for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP among black and poor children was reduced to statistical insignificance. We conclude that black and poor children in the United States do have higher rates of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, that social and environmental factors exert substantial influences on rates of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, and that much of the racial and economic disparity in prevalence can be accounted for by a variety of social and environmental characteristics.

Evaluation of the efficacy and cost effectiveness of health education methods to increase medication adherence among adults with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.We randomized 135 adult Asthma_ASDPTO_HP patients to a control group, and 132 patients to an experimental group which received a special health education intervention. Four adherence measures were documented at baseline and 12-month follow-up: correct inhaler use, inhaler adherence, medication adherence, and total adherence rating. Costs to routinely deliver the intervention were $32.03/patient. Experimental group patients exhibited a significantly higher level of improvement in adherence (44 percent) than control group patients (2 percent).

Circadian basis of the late asthmatic response.The late asthmatic response (LAR) to an allergen challenge has a marked impact on lung function in the patient with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Virtually all studies on the LAR have been done during the daytime. This study evaluated the LAR as a function of the time of day an inhaled allergen challenge was performed. An allergen challenge given in the morning produced a LAR in 4 of 10 subjects, while the same challenge in the evening caused a LAR in 9 of 10 (p less than 0.05). The time to Onset_HP of the LAR following the morning and evening challenges was 9.4 +/- 2.0 h versus 3.1 +/- 0.3 h, respectively (p less than 0.05). The maximal decrease in FEV1 for the LAR was 32.8 +/- 5.6% for the morning challenge versus 43.0 +/- 3.1% in the evening (p less than 0.05). Additionally, the bronchial responsiveness to methacholine was significantly greater at 24 h following evening allergen challenge than after the morning (p less than 0.05) challenge. Thus, it is important to take into account the time of day a patient is exposed to an allergen in regard to the development of the LAR.

Computerized tomography in the evaluation of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a destructive disease of the lung characteristically associated with Central_HP Bronchiectasis_HP. This study was designed to determine if high-resolution computerized tomography (CT) could be used to define Bronchiectasis_HP in patients with suspected disease. Sixteen patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were studied. All demonstrated immediate cutaneous reactivity to common aeroallergens including Aspergillus fumigatus. Eight patients had clinical and immunologic evidence of ABPA. Six to 12 high-resolution CT sections (1.5 mm) were obtained at 1- to 2-cm intervals from the aortic knob to the dome of the diaphragm. All radiographs were evaluated separately by two readers in a blinded fashion and graded as to the presence and type of bronchial Dilatation_HP and bronchial wall thickening. Bronchial Dilatation_HP was seen in 41% of lung lobes in the ABPA group compared to 15% in the non-ABPA asthmatic control group. Upper lobe involvement and bronchial wall thickening was common to both groups. The presence of Bronchiectasis_HP in the control group may indicate that Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is a more destructive Abnormal_lung_morphology_HP than is currently appreciated. High-resolution CT of the chest has been shown in previous studies to have a sensitivity and specificity approaching that of bronchography, and the current findings support its use in the detection of Bronchiectasis_HP in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP suspected of having ABPA.

[Gastroesophageal_reflux_HP and respiratory manifestations: diagnostic approach, therapeutic indications and results].The authors report a study of 140 patients presenting with a non-allergic respiratory tract disease (121 cases of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP--19 cases of spasmodic Cough_HP). Gastro-oesophageal reflux was detected by 24-hour pHmetry in 86 of these patients. In 34 of them (i.e. 40% of cases), the gastro-oesophageal reflux appeared to be responsible for the initial respiratory tract symptoms. These 34 patients were submitted to a therapeutic trial of high dose anti-H2 therapy for at least two months. Only those patients in whom a marked improvement or even complete resolution of the respiratory tracts symptoms was observed underwent anti-reflux surgery. Out of the 13 patients undergoing surgery, there were two failures and 11 good results after a follow-up of more than 18 months.

Profile of bronchospastic disease in Puerto Rican patients in New York City. A possible relationship to alpha 1-antitrypsin variants.A high prevalence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HPlike symptoms was noted among patients of Puerto Rican descent attending Beth Israel and North Central_HP Bronx Medical Centers in New York City, as compared with other ethnic groups. An evaluation of family and medical histories, pulmonary function data, and alpha 1-antitrypsin phenotypes was undertaken in such Puerto Rican patients and control subjects without Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The patients showed a higher proportion of MS and MV phenotypes. All the patients in both MM and variant phenotype groups, with the exception of four MM patients, had features indicative of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, with labile airway obstruction, and elevated serum immunoglobulin E and eosinophil levels. The latter was significantly higher in the patients with variant phenotypes than in MM patients. Patients with alpha 1-antitrypsin variants also had much shorter Smoking_ASDPTO histories as compared with the MM group, and all reported histories of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in first-degree relatives, as compared with 66% among the MM patients. We conclude that there is an increased incidence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP among Puerto Ricans in New York City, and that the antitrypsin variant phenotypes (specifically S and V) play a role in this incidence and its expression.

[Long-term follow up studies of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in children. II. Prognosis and complications, treatment and allergic evaluations].A questionnaire on the prognosis of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was sent in 1988 to 1592 patients (1038 males, 554 females) averaging 20 years of age after 12 years' follow up. We reported on the prognosis and risk factors associated with Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic children in part I. The relation between prognosis and other allergic complications, treatment and laboratory data were investigated in this study. Eosinophil counts of more than 1000/mm3 and/or total serum IgE levels of more than 500 IU/ml (100 IU/ml in infants) indicated poor prognosis. However, the prognosis was not Affected_HP either by the allergens themselves or by the number of allergens determined by skin test and RAST. The prognosis was worse for patients with multiple allergic complications than for those without complications. Treatment may after the natural course of childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, but it has been difficult to evaluate the effect of each regimen over a long period. We compared the effect of hyposensitization (specific immunization) and non-bronchodilator antiAsthma_ASDPTO_HPtic drugs (NBAAD), and found that hyposensitization alone gave better results than NBAAD and its combination. We had better results from hyposensitization over a period of 1 to 5 years than for less than 1 year or more than 5 years. We conclude that Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic children with risk factors should be kept under strict environmental control and given suitable therapeutic regimens to avoid the development of allergic diseases, the slow down of "allergic march", and to avoid intractable Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

[Clinical study on Asthma_ASDPTO_HP patients whose bronchial hypersensitivity has been improved].In order to determine which factors would Affect_ASDPTO the improvement of bronchial hypersensitivity in Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients, a clinical investigation was performed on 42 cases whose bronchial hypersensitivity had been tested more than two times. The following results were obtained. 1) The numbers of bronchial hypersensitivity-improved cases was 16 while there were 26 unimproved cases. There was no statistical difference in age, sex, type of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, Severity_HP of disease at first visit or type of therapy between the two groups. FEV1.0% in the bronchial hypersensitivity-improved group was significantly higher than that in the unimproved group (p less than 0.01). 2) In the improved group, all cases (16/16) were shown to have become free of symptoms, but this applied to only 38% (10/26) in the unimproved group. 3) In the 26 cases who had become free of symptoms, the improvement index in histamine test and the ratio of improved cases showed a tendency to increase as the period during which the patient showed no symptoms extended. It was suggested that bronchial hypersensitivity in cases with higher FEV1.0% would improve more easily, and that the induction and maintenance of a symptom free state is important for the improvement of bronchial hypersensitivity.

Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Eczema_HP in children born to women with Migraine_HP.Migraine_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP have been reported to occur in the same person more commonly than would be expected if they are independent. The large Collaborative Perinatal Project provided an opportunity to see if children born to women with Migraine_HP or with the group of disorders characterized by Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and/or Allergies_ASDPTO were more likely to manifest Asthma_ASDPTO_HP or Eczema_HP in the first 7 years of life. Among children whose mothers had neither Migraine_HP nor Asthma_ASDPTO_HP/Allergies_ASDPTO, 3.2% had Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Of children whose mothers had Migraine_HP, but not Asthma_ASDPTO_HP/Allergies_ASDPTO, more than 6% had Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The risk of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP among children born to women who had both Migraine_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP/Allergies_ASDPTO was greater than the risk associated with each maternal disease. The risk of Eczema_HP in children was not appreciably influenced by the mother's propensity to Migraine_HP or Asthma_ASDPTO_HP/Allergies_ASDPTO. The results of this first study of Migraine_HP in one generation and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in the next lead to the conclusion that the two disorders are probably related.

Among children whose mothers had neither migraine nor asthma/allergies, 3.2% had asthma. Of children whose mothers had migraine, but not asthma/allergies, more than 6% had asthma. The risk of asthma among children born to women who had both migraine and asthma/allergies was greater than the risk associated with each maternal disease. The risk of eczema in children was not appreciably influenced by the mother's propensity to migraine or asthma/allergies. The results of this first study of migraine in one generation and asthma in the next lead to the conclusion that the two disorders are probably related.

Bronchial responsiveness to mite allergen in Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP without Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Eight patients with Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP (AD) without a history of asthmatic episodes and 8 patients with mite-allergic bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (BA) were subjected to bronchial inhalation challenge with a nonspecific stimulus (acetylcholine) and an immunologically specific stimulus (house dust mite allergen). AD patients had a significantly greater concentration of IgE (p less than 0.01) and antimite IgE antibody (p less than 0.05) than BA patients. Nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivities of AD patients distributed from normal to asthmatic range. After allergen challenge, all 8 AD patients and all 8 BA patients showed an immediate asthmatic response (IAR). The mite extract concentration to induce an IAR was significantly (p less than 0.01) greater in AD patients than in BA patients. A late asthmatic response was observed in 6 out of 8 BA patients, whereas it was not observed in any AD patient. Our results showed that AD patients are less reactive to a specific mite allergen than BA patients in spite of greater concentrations of antimite IgE antibody. They suggest that this difference in the bronchial reactivity to the allergen concerns the difference in the Onset_HP of clinical symptoms and that a certain level of bronchial hyperreactivity to the allergen is a prerequisite for the development of asthmatic symptoms.
Bronchial responsiveness to mite allergen in atopic dermatitis without asthma.Eight patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) without a history of asthmatic episodes and 8 patients with mite-allergic bronchial asthma (BA) were subjected to bronchial inhalation challenge with a nonspecific stimulus (acetylcholine) and an immunologically specific stimulus (house dust mite allergen).

Case report of occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP due to palisander wood dust and bronchoprovocation challenge by inhalation of pure wood dust from a capsule.Occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP due to exposure to exotic wood dust and to rosewood (Dalbergia family) has been reported earlier. This paper deals with a case of occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP due to palisander wood dust (Dalbergia nigra) in a joiner who sanded and polished parts of musical instruments. The causal relationship was confirmed by a positive skin reaction to an allergenic preparation and a positive nonimmediate, late asthmatic reaction after inhalation challenge testing with pure palisander wood dust. A method of bronchoprovocation testing with an occupational allergen is presented. It proved to be a practical and advantageous method in its simplicity and single-blind application of placebo. It should, however, be used with great caution, in well-chosen cases in whom nonspecific bronchial reactivity is proved or recorded to be in normal ranges.

Nasal inhalation of the glucocorticoid budesonide from a spacer for the treatment of patients with pollen Rhinitis_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Glucocorticoid sprays are increasingly used for the treatment of allergic Rhinitis_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. This therapy is highly effective, and side effects are few and Mild_HP. It was the aim of the present study to evaluate a physiological nasal inhalation technique, which results in airway deposition of the steroid molecule similar to that of inhaled allergen particles. Thirty adults with grass pollen-induced Rhinitis_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP inhaled the steroid molecule budesonide through the nose from a pressurized aerosol attached to a spacer device. Compared with inhalation of placebo, the treatment resulted in a significant reduction of nasal symptoms (P = 0.005), of bronchial symptoms (P = 0.005), but not of eye symptoms. In addition, nasal peak inspiratory flow (P = 0.0003) and oral peak expiratory flow (P = 0.02) increased. There was no difference between budesonide and placebo with regard to local side effects, such as Epistaxis_HP, Hoarse_voice_HP, and irritation in mouth and throat. It is concluded that nasal inhalation of a steroid from a spacer offers effective therapy of pollen Rhinitis_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP without significant local side effects. This therapeutic modality may have advantages over the ordinarily used nasal and bronchial spray treatment in patients with both Rhinitis_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, especially when conventional spray therapy is associated with local side effects.

Masqueraders in clinical Allergy_HP: laryngeal dysfunction causing Dyspnea_HP.The allergist may be called upon to evaluate patients with Dyspnea_HP that is labeled "Refractory_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP." In some patients, the site of origin of their Dyspnea_HP is the larynx. The Diagnosis_ASDPTO of laryngeal disorders requires a thorough understanding of the normal function of the laryngeal anatomy and physiology. Some patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP may have a component of their airway obstruction in the larynx and large airways. Paradoxical vocal cord motion occurs when the true vocal cords approximate during inspiration, and although Severe_HP subjective Dyspnea_HP may occur, in most cases there is no evidence of hypoxia, hemoglobin desaturation, or an abnormality of the arterial-alveolar oxygen gradient. Provocative tests with methacholine are negative in this group of patients. Patients with PVCM are usually female and may have an affiliation with the medical profession. Many have psychologic difficulties, and the foundation of treatment is speech therapy and psychotherapy if indicated. Other disorders that may produce Dyspnea_HP from laryngeal dysfunction include Meige syndrome, abductor spastic Dysphonia_HP, and Laryngospasm_HP. Recognition of these disorders will expedite timely, accurate Diagnosis_ASDPTO and treatment.

Silk-induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in children: a report of 64 cases.A total of 64 children less than 15 years of age with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP caused by silk were studied. The Diagnosis_ASDPTO was based on a history of Wheezing_HP, positive skin tests to silk, positive conjunctival or nasal provocation tests, or serum IgE-Sw (silk waste). The average Onset_HP was 4 years 2 months. Sex ratio (M:F) was 3.6:1. A positive skin test is essential for the Diagnosis_ASDPTO. Conjunctival provocation tests were performed in 80% of cases because of reliability, safety, and convenience. The first symptom appeared an average of 10 months after initial exposure to silk. In 61% of patients, Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was accompanied by Allergic_Rhinitis_HP but in only 14% of cases by Conjunctivitis_HP. In most cases, Asthma_ASDPTO_HP occurred in winter, due to seasonal use of bed quilts or clothes filled with silk. Silk is a highly potent allergen. The average mean wheal diameter elicited by silk in prick testing was larger than two histamine equivalent prick tests. A cross reactivity exists among mulberry silk, and silkworm cocoons, batryticated silkworms, and silkworm chrysalis.

Low level atmospheric sulfur dioxide pollution and childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Quarterly analysis (1983-1987) of childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in Hong Kong from 13,620 hospitalization episodes in relation to levels of pollutants (SO2, NO2, NO, O3, TSP, and RSP) revealed a seasonal pattern of attack rates that correlates inversely with exposure to sulfur dioxide (r = -.52, P less than .05). The same cannot be found with other pollutants. Many factors may contribute to the seasonal variation of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attacks. We speculate that Prolonged_HP exposure (in terms of months) to low level SO2 is one factor that might induce airway inflammation and bronchial hyperreactivity and predispose to episodes of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

A random double-blind trial of the combination of nebulized atropine methylnitrate and albuterol in Nocturnal_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The combination of nebulized atropine methylnitrate (AMN) and a beta-agonist has been shown to produce greater and longer lasting bronchodilation than either drug alone. We examined the efficacy of the combination in diminishing the "morning dipping" in PEFR in eight hospitalized but Stable_HP asthmatics. The patients received nebulized albuterol along with either AMN (AMN + ALB) or placebo (ALB) in a random double-blind cross-over fashion at 10 PM on four nights. PEFR and FEV1 were recorded at 6 PM, 10 PM, and 6 AM before the administration of bronchodilators. There was no statistically significant difference between ALB and AMN + ALB in reducing the morning dipping in these patients.

Diagnostic value of maximal exercise tidal volume.Though breathing pattern is frequently analyzed during clinical exercise testing, there is little information regarding its usefulness in the differential Diagnosis_ASDPTO of impaired exercise tolerance. This study tested the hypothesis that differences in peak tidal volume during exercise between patients with different cardiorespiratory diseases are related largely to differences in Severity_HP of respiratory mechanical impairment (vital capacity), not to differences in disease state. Patients with Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP, Restrictive_ventilatory_defect_HP, Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, and heart disease (mitral valve disease or Left_HP_ventricular_dysfunction_HP) were studied. Subjects selected had one and only one of the above diagnoses. All subjects performed maximal (symptom-limited) incremental exercise on a cycle ergometer. Multiple linear regression of all subjects (n = 30) in all four groups showed a significant correlation between VTmax and VC: VTmax = 0.55, VC -0.09 L (r = 0.827, p less than 0.0001). The VTmax/VC (x 100) was (mean +/- SD) 44 +/- 15, 54 +/- 11, 56 +/- 11, and 54 +/- 12 for the Chronic_HP_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP, RLD, BA and HD patients respectively. There was no significant difference between any of the groups. We concluded that differences in VTmax between different patients are related largely to differences in VC (ie, differences in Severity_HP of respiratory mechanical impairment), not to differences in disease state. Measurement of VTmax or the VTmax/VC ratio has little value in the differential Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Exertional_Dyspnea_HP.

Predicting the need for hospitalization in children with Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.In an attempt to identify factors which influence the decision of physicians to admit patients with Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP to the hospital, we studied prospectively 200 children (age 5.6 +/- 3.1 years, mean +/- SD) presenting to our emergency room with Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The children were assessed on arrival, and on disposition from the Emergency Room by one of the investigators. After obtaining historic data, a clinical score was assigned, and oxygen saturation and pulmonary function were measured. Of the 134 (67 percent) children who were discharged home from the Emergency Room, five returned within seven days and one was subsequently admitted. The clinical score on disposition was the sole variable found to best predict the decision for hospitalization (sensitivity 73 percent, specificity 95 percent). Of the variables obtained at presentation, the resulting decision tree found the clinical score to predict the decision for hospitalization (sensitivity 79 percent, specificity 75 percent). When the individual components of the clinical score were analyzed, the degree of Dyspnea_HP, as assessed by the investigator, was chosen as the rule to predict the hospitalization decision (sensitivity 88 percent, specificity 71 percent). We conclude that the decision with respect to the need for hospitalization in Acute_HP childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, is in practice based mainly on careful clinical evaluation. Pulmonary function and SaO2 measurements, although helpful adjuncts in the assessment of Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, do not appear to contribute to the identification of patients who need hospital admission.

Clinical obsolete_Dysautonomia_HP in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Study with seven autonomic function tests.Fifty Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients and 20 Healthy_HP control subjects, carefully age- and sex-matched, were subjected to seven standardized tests to evaluate their autonomic status. Due care was taken to remove factors which could interfere with results. Of the tests concerned with the parasympathetic system, the intravenous atropine test (p greater than 0.10) and heart rate response to standing (p greater than 0.01) which measured the basal parasympathetic tone, did not show a significant difference. Tests requiring stimulation of the parasympathetic system, ie, deep breathing test (p less than 0.001), Valsalva maneuver (p less than 0.001), and carotid sinus massage (p less than 0.001) showed significantly heightened response. Postural fall of blood pressure (p greater than 0.10) and sustained hand grip test (p greater than 0.10), chiefly concerned with the sympathetic system, did not show a significant difference. Of the 50 Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients, nine were atopic and 41 nonatopic. When the results were compared in the two groups separately, we found that there was no alteration in the measurements except the intravenous atropine test which showed heightened response with atopic subjects (p less than 0.05). These results suggest that hyperresponsiveness of the parasympathetic system is an important factor in producing bronchial spasm in Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients, and atopic and nonatopic subjects do not differ much in their autonomic status.

Effect of inhaled methacholine on inspiratory flow.One hundred consecutive outpatients with symptoms suggestive of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP who came to the Pulmonary Function Laboratory for a methacholine challenge test were studied. In addition to the forced expiratory maneuvers, forced inspiratory maneuvers were performed before and after the maximal response to methacholine. In 24 patients, the methacholine challenge suggested that they had Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV1] decrease greater than or equal to 20 percent). Six of these 24 patients also had a decrease in maximal forced inspiratory flow (FIFmax) greater than or equal to 20 percent and nine had a decrease in forced inspiratory flow at 50 percent of vital capacity (FIF50) greater than or equal to 20 percent, suggesting that bronchoconstriction can cause decreased inspiratory as well as expiratory flows. In 76 patients, the methacholine challenges were "negative" (FEV1 decrease less than or equal to 20 percent), suggesting that they did not have Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Nevertheless, in 11 of these 76 patients the FIFmax decrease was greater than or equal to 20 percent, and in 14 patients the FIF50 decrease was greater than or equal to 20 percent, suggesting that Recurrent_HP Central_HP airway obstruction is responsible for these patients' symptoms.

Permanent venous access via subcutaneous infusion port in Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.A subcutaneous infusion port was implanted in a 34-year-old patient with Frequent_HP and Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attacks to ensure prompt and reliable venous access. Difficulties with Peripheral_HP venous access were possible cofactors necessitating mechanical ventilation on two occasions before this implantation. The method described is simple and seems useful for asthmatics in need of Frequent_HP parenteral medication.

Relationship between LTC4 generation of hypodense eosinophils and bronchial hyperreactivity in asthmatic children.In 19 asthmatic children aged 6-16 years, the degree of bronchial hyperreactivity was determined in relationship to the concentration of inhaled histamine which caused a fall of the specific conductance (sGaw) to 60% of the baseline value PC60sGaw. At the time of lung function testing, a sample of heparinized blood was obtained from each patient. Eosinophils were purified and separated into a normodense and hypodense fraction by Percoll gradient centrifugation. After in vitro stimulation by ionophore A 23187, the leukotriene C4 (LTC4) content was determined in the culture supernatants. Hypodense eosinophils of the 13 children with a histamine threshold lower than 1 mg/ml generated significantly (p less than 0.01) larger amounts of LTC4 (0.8-36.3 ng/10(6) cells) when compared to 6 children with a histamine threshold higher than 1 mg/ml (0.7-12.1 ng/10(6) cells) and 12 Healthy_HP controls (0.4-8.2 ng/10(6) cells). Preincubation of eosinophils with platelet activating factor (PAF) induced an enhanced LTC4 production, not only in hypodense cells from both asthmatic groups but also in normodense cells from patients with Severe_HP hyperresponsiveness. These results are consistent with other results which suggest an important role of eosinophils, their activation by PAF and enhanced release of spasmogenic LTC4 in the pathogenesis of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

After in vitro stimulation by ionophore A 23187, the leukotriene C4 (LTC4) content was determined in the culture supernatants. Hypodense eosinophils of the 13 children with a histamine threshold lower than 1 mg/ml generated significantly (p less than 0.01) larger amounts of LTC4 (0.8-36.3 ng/10(6) cells) when compared to 6 children with a histamine threshold higher than 1 mg/ml (0.7-12.1 ng/10(6) cells) and 12 healthy controls (0.4-8.2 ng/10(6) cells). Preincubation of eosinophils with platelet activating factor (PAF) induced an enhanced LTC4 production, not only in hypodense cells from both asthmatic groups but also in normodense cells from patients with severe hyperresponsiveness. These results are consistent with other results which suggest an important role of eosinophils, their activation by PAF and enhanced release of spasmogenic LTC4 in the pathogenesis of asthma.
Exogenous corticosteroid effects on Mood_ASDPTO and cognition: case presentations.Eight patients who had undergone greater than five years of Recurrent_HP treatments with corticosteroids volunteered to be interviewed about their experiences. Seven patients stated they were not warned by their physicians of the possible psychiatric side effects. Five patients did not inform their physicians when symptoms did occur. The patients complained of Insomnia_HP, Depression_ASDPTO, hypomania or Euphoria_HP, Confusion_HP, and Memory_impairment_HP. Based on these reports, the Frequency_HP of affective and cognitive side effects of exogenous corticosteroids may be much higher than has been previously reported. The studies in the literature are discussed and recommendations are given for evaluating these side effects in patients who are treated with corticosteroids.
Exogenous corticosteroid effects on mood and cognition: case presentations.Eight patients who had undergone greater than five years of intermittent treatments with corticosteroids volunteered to be interviewed about their experiences. Seven patients stated they were not warned by their physicians of the possible psychiatric side effects. Five patients did not inform their physicians when symptoms did occur. The patients complained of insomnia, Depressivity_HP, hypomania or euphoria, confusion, and memory problems. Based on these reports, the frequency of affective and cognitive side effects of exogenous corticosteroids may be much higher than has been previously reported.

Immunoglobulins and Allergy_HP mediators in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Seventy four young Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics were evaluated to establish the role of immunoglobulins and Allergy_HP mediators in clinical Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. They were categorized into Group I (n = 38) or Group II (n = 36) when having Mild_HP or Severe_HP Bronchospasm_HP respectively. In some patients, reversibility of Bronchospasm_HP (n = 35), exercise challenge (n = 24) and intradermal Allergy_HP testing (n = 24) were also studied. Seventy subjects had raised IgE levels (greater than 100 KU/L) but these did not correlate with the Severity_HP of clinical or exercise induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP or with reversibility of Bronchospasm_HP. An IgE level greater than 1000 KU/L was associated with more number of positive skin tests. Group II subjects had a shorter blood recalcification time (p less than 0.01) and higher levels of IgG, histamine and serotonin (p less than 0.001). It appears that Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is associated with activation of blood coagulation, and release of Allergy_HP mediators contributes to the evolution of Bronchospasm_HP. Total IgE predicts the utility of skin testing in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.
Immunoglobulins and allergy mediators in bronchial asthma.Seventy four young asthmatics were evaluated to establish the role of immunoglobulins and allergy mediators in clinical asthma.

Chronic_HP_Sinusitis_HP and the yellow nail syndrome.Diagnosing syndromes that include Chronic_HP_Sinusitis_HP can expedite the management of both conditions. Yellow nail syndrome is usually described as the combination of Yellow_nails_HP, Lymphedema_HP and often respiratory manifestations such as Chronic_HP_Sinusitis_HP, Bronchiectasis_HP and pleural effusions. The pathology responsible for the syndrome is believed to be lymphatic hypoplasia. Diagnosis_ASDPTO of yellow nail syndrome is clinical not requiring any specialized tests. In the two cases described, the respiratory tract manifestations required the most active investigation and management. The significance of this syndrome to the otolaryngologist is discussed.

The effects of a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor on Asthma_ASDPTO_HP induced by cold, dry air.The enzyme 5-lipoxygenase catalyzes the metabolism of arachidonic acid to form products that have been implicated in the airway obstruction of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. We hypothesized that if products of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway are important in mediating this obstruction, then prevention of their formation should decrease the Severity_HP of an induced asthmatic response.

Is Allergic_Rhinitis_HP more Frequent_HP in young adults with extreme Shyness_HP? A preliminary survey.Previous studies suggest that Social_Anxiety_ASDPTO, Allergies_ASDPTO and distressed Affect_ASDPTO may be interrelated in some persons. For example, extremely introverted patients experience a poorer course and outcome of Allergies_ASDPTO as well as greater degrees of distressed Affect_ASDPTO such as Depression_ASDPTO and Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP than do extraverts. Patients with Affect_ASDPTOive disorders have a higher prevalence of atopic Allergy_HP than the general population; families of patients with panic disorder and major Depression_ASDPTO have the highest Frequency_HP of shy children. Preliminary investigation also indicate that behaviorally inhibited Caucasian children (initially shy and cautions in unfamiliar situations) and their families have more Allergies_ASDPTO, especially Allergic_Rhinitis_HP, than do uninhibited, socially outgoing children. The present survey evaluated the Frequency_HP of self-reported Shyness_HP. The most introverted subjects had significantly higher scores on self reports of Depression_ASDPTO, fearfulness, and Fatigue_HP, as well as a higher prevalence of Allergic_Rhinitis_HP. The data support the possibility of a distinct subgroup of shy individuals with concomitant vulnerability to specific Allergies_ASDPTO and Affect_ASDPTOive disorders.

Do large volume spacer devices reduce the systemic effects of high dose inhaled corticosteroids?When used in high doses, inhaled corticosteroids may cause suppression of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. The influence of the mode of drug inhalation on the degree of this suppression is not clear. Hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal function was assessed by measurement of 0900 h serum cortisol concentrations, a short tetracosactrin test, and 24 hour urine free cortisol excretion in 48 adults with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP taking 1500-2500 micrograms beclomethasone dipropionate daily via a metered dose aerosol. Twelve patients had hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal suppression, as judged by subnormal results from at least two of the three tests or (in one patient) by an abnormal insulin stress test response. These patients then changed to inhaling the same dose of beclomethasone dipropionate through a 750 ml spacer device (Volumatic). The endocrine tests were repeated from nine days to eight weeks later in 10 patients. Comparison with initial values showed that adding the spacing device caused an increase in the median 0900 h cortisol concentration from 126 nmol/l to 398 nmol/l, in the post-tetracosactrin cortisol concentration from 402 nmol/l to 613 nmol/l and in 24 hour urine free cortisol excretion from 54 nmol to 84 nmol. The rise in serum cortisol concentration in response to tetracosactrin did not change. Evidence of persisting hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression was present in only four of the 10 patients; the most pronounced improvements in function tended to occur in those who had never required long term oral corticosteroids. The results from this uncontrolled study suggest that asthmatic patients taking high dose beclomethasone dipropionate may minimise adverse effects by using a large volume spacer device.

[The prevalence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in a selected sample of the adult Prague population].The authors assessed the prevalence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in 8458 18-year-old and older inhabitants of an economic area in Prague 8. The population of the area up to December 31, 1987 was 90,458 adults. The health communities were selected in a random way to comprise the Central_HP as well as Peripheral_HP parts of Prague 8. By means of questionnaires information was assembled from 70.9% of the respondents and after supplementation of data by various doctors the scope of information was 89.9% (7605/8458). For detailed examination 902 subjects were selected with "confirmed" and suspect symptoms of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The anamnestic data were analyzed and pulmonary ventilation was examined (flow-volume), and depending on indication, also the provocation or bronchodilatation inhalation test, skin tests, and total IgE. The cumulative prevalence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was 2.3% +/- 0.3% (174/7605). The highest prevalence values were in subjects under 20 years--3.5% and under 30 years--3.6%. The contemporary prevalence was 2.0% +/- 0.3% (152/7605). Nonatopic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was recorded in 54%, atopic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in 46% of the subjects.
[The prevalence of bronchial asthma in a selected sample of the adult Prague population].The authors assessed the prevalence of bronchial asthma in 8458 18-year-old and older inhabitants of an economic area in Prague 8. The population of the area up to December 31, 1987 was 90,458 adults. The health communities were selected in a random way to comprise the central as well as peripheral parts of Prague 8.

Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Gastroesophageal_reflux_HP into the Distal_HP and Proximal_HP oesophagus.The prevalence of pathological gastro-oesophageal reflux in children and adolescents with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was studied by 24 hour two level oesophageal pH monitoring in 42 subjects aged 9-20 years with Moderate_HP or Severe_HP bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The importance of oesophagobronchial nerve reflexes and of Aspiration_HP of gastric acid as triggers in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was assessed by studying whether episodes of reflux into the Distal_HP and into the Proximal_HP oesophagus were followed by Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attacks. Twenty-one subjects (50%) had a pathological total reflux time in the Distal_HP oesophagus and six (16%) in the Proximal_HP oesophagus. Nine patients had pathological gastro-oesophageal reflux into the Distal_HP oesophagus together with symptoms of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP during the day on which the recording took place. In three of them the episodes of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP symptoms were significantly correlated with preceding episodes of reflux into the Distal_HP oesophagus, and in one subject to reflux into the Proximal_HP oesophagus. We conclude that pathological gastro-oesophageal reflux is common in children and adolescents with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, but it seems to provoke symptoms of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in only a few. Symptoms of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were more often elicited by exposure of the Distal_HP oesophagus to gastric acid, possibly by a vagal reflex, than by Aspiration_HP of gastric juice.
Bronchial asthma and acid reflux into the distal and proximal oesophagus.The prevalence of pathological gastro-oesophageal reflux in children and adolescents with asthma was studied by 24 hour two level oesophageal pH monitoring in 42 subjects aged 9-20 years with moderate or severe bronchial asthma. The importance of oesophagobronchial nerve reflexes and of aspiration of gastric acid as triggers in asthma was assessed by studying whether episodes of reflux into the distal and into the proximal oesophagus were followed by asthma attacks.

[Respiratory history in children and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, the respiratory history and possible disturbances of pulmonary function in teenage asthmatics. This aetiological study was carried out in 103 asthmatics and 1094 controls who were teenagers attending schools in Bordeaux. In addition to the data collected by the teenagers using a self administered questionnaire, parents also filled out a complementary questionnaire. Spirometry was performed in a sample of 112 subjects. The result showed a significant relationship between Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and respiratory history in childhood and infancy. Moreover there was a significant decrease of FEV1, (in girls only) and FEF 25-75 (boys and girls) amongst the asthmatic pupils.

[Childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and sports in school: a survey of teachers of sports and physical education].Exercise induced bronchial obstruction is very common in asthmatic children who represent at least 5% of the general paediatric population. 89 teachers of physical education at school replied to a questionnaire on Asthma_ASDPTO_HP: 82% knew the existence of exercise induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, all thought that asthmatics can do sport at school; however their knowledge of this disorder seemed insufficient to offer sporting activities in a satisfactory manner; the idea of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP as a psychological disorder is well ingrained (61.6%), they felt that necessarily the bronchial obstruction should be noticed by the asthmatic (58%) and finally a significant proportion (29%) thought that they had never seen a child in an asthmatic crisis during their lessons. The majority (88%) were favourable to information on Asthma_ASDPTO_HP given by an information film followed by a discussion.

[Practical diagnostic approach to anomalies of the aortic arch. Apropos of 31 pediatric cases].This analysis of 31 cases of anomalies of the aortic arch has confirmed the predominance of subclavian retro-oesophageal arteries and double aortic arches (74% of cases). The age at which the first clinical signs presented was less than one year in 75% of cases. Respiratory signs predominated with Recurrent_HP_Bronchitis_HP (16 cases) and bronchial congestion (9 cases). These signs were not specific for the type of aetiology and were characterised by their chronicity and Recurrent_HP nature. Inspiratory and expiratory Stridor_HP was found on 8 occasions and was very suggestive of the Diagnosis_ASDPTO. There was a Frequent_HP association of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and anomalies of the aortic arch in this series (13 cases) with 6 cases of atopic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in early childhood and 7 cases of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in infancy. The oesophago-gastroduodenal transit was the key Diagnosis_ASDPTO which enabled the vascular anomaly to be confirmed. There was, however, a failure on 5 occasions with 2 false negatives and 3 cases where the wrong type was suspected. Fibreoptic bronchoscopy enabled the topography to be established more precisely including the degree of compression (in 14 cases) and showed evidence of associated Tracheomalacia_HP in 7 cases. Nuclear magnetic resonance was very helpful, giving a better definition of the anatomical type and of the relationship of the vascular arch with the oesophago-tracheal axis. Broncho-fibroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance make strong contributions towards the indications for operation.

Cardiovascular anomalies associated with prenatal exposure to theophylline.Theophylline has been shown to be a potent cardiovascular teratogen in animals, but there has been no evidence linking theophylline with congenital anomalies in infants. The cardiovascular anomalies in our three patients were aortic anomalies, Double_outlet_Right_HP_ventricle_HP, Transposition_of_the_great_arteries_HP, Total_anomalous_pulmonary_venous_return_HP, and hypoplasia of the Left_HP ventricle. Some of these rare defects were also induced frequently in animal experiments with theophylline, which suggests that this drug can be a cardiovascular teratogen in a susceptible human fetus.

The prevalence of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in Cape Town schoolchildren.An attempt was made to determine: (i) the prevalence of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction among white and coloured schoolchildren in Cape Town; and (ii) the validity of an exercise test for the Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in the general population. Children (698 white and 494 coloured) were randomly drawn from schools in the northern suburbs of Cape Town. Each child participated in a standard 6-minute exercise test and spirometric measurements were taken before and 10 minutes after exercise with a portable spirometer. The Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was based on a questionnaire and personal questioning and included those children who, in the past or at present, suffered Episodic_HP or continuous airflow obstruction, which was responsive to a bronchodilator. The criterion for the Diagnosis_ASDPTO of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction was a 10% decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second after exercise. The prevalence of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction was significantly higher among white children (5.87%) than coloured children (4.05%). The sensitivity of the exercise test was 0.31 and the specificity 0.97. In contrast to the results of hospital-based studies, the negative predictive value of an exercise test (95%) was found to be greater than the positive predictive value (46%). It is therefore concluded that exercise testing is not a useful screening test for epidemiological use; it is probably useful as a challenge test for detecting Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in the individual patient when the likelihood of the disease is high.

Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Hyperthyroidism_HP. A report of 4 cases.For many years it has been known that thyrotoxicosis can worsen Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, increasing both the Frequency_HP and Severity_HP of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attacks and increasing requirements for medication. Clinical recognition of this association may be difficult. Thyrotoxic asthmatics frequently experience side-effects from Medications_ASDPTO, particularly beta-receptor agonists and theophyllines. Four case reports of asthmatics in whom thyrotoxicosis was diagnosed are presented. All 4 patients improved on returning to euthyroid status. The mechanism responsible for the harmful interaction is not known.

A report of 4 cases.For many years it has been known that thyrotoxicosis can worsen asthma, increasing both the frequency and severity of asthma attacks and increasing requirements for medication. Clinical recognition of this association may be difficult. Thyrotoxic asthmatics frequently experience side-effects from medications, particularly beta-receptor agonists and theophyllines. Four case reports of asthmatics in whom thyrotoxicosis was diagnosed are presented. All 4 patients improved on returning to euthyroid status. The mechanism responsible for the harmful interaction is not known.
[Glycosaminoglycans in leukocytes of children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].Content of hexuronic acids, hexoses and hexosamines was studied in lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes of 56 children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The disease step-dependent alterations of the patterns studied were detected. Treatment of these children with bronchospasmolytic drug clenbuterol and with immunomodulator taktivine Affected_HP positively the Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attack, which was followed by specific alterations in the carbohydrates content. Structural modifications of glycosaminoglycans in lymphocytes and phagocytes appear to be of importance for formation and development of allergic reactions in children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Secretory_IgA_deficiency_HP in pediatric patients: clinical and laboratory follow-up.This is a prospective three-year (1985-1988) clinical and laboratory follow-up study of 43 pediatric patients without any measurable secretory IgA, intending to describe the their natural course. We also intended to detect evidence which may allow to predict their future outcome, whether they would become asymptomatic or end up developing Chronic_HP disease. A direct statistical correlation was found between those patients who normalize their secretory IgA levels and their course in an asymptomatic state. Thus, if a child does not have any sIgA at all, the relative risk to get sick is 0.86 (86%), while in those having sIgA within normal ranges, the relative risk of disease decreases to 0.46 (46%), representing a p value less than or equal to 0.05. Among the analyzed variables and their influence on the fact that a patient may or may not synthesize sIgA, none of them showed a predictive value for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP by itself. However, when sIgA and total serum IgE levels, were analyzed together (being the two variables demonstrating to influence), the probability of becoming Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic is much greater in the ones with elevated total serum IgE and absent sIgA. This group is significantly different from the one with normal IgE and sIgA levels (p less than or equal to 0.001). According to our experience in evaluating and controlling a pediatric patient with repeated episodes of bronchial obstruction and lacking sIgA, an immediate strict environmental control should be established in order to avoid all possible contacts with allergens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Clinical significance of IgG subclass antibodies to wheat flour antigens in bakers.We measured the IgG subclass antibody levels to wheat flour in 42 bakers and 20 controls with an enzyme immunoassay. The levels of total IgG, IgG1 IgG2 and IgG4 antibodies were significantly higher in the bakers than in the unexposed controls. The presence of anti-wheat flour IgG subclass antibodies in the bakers was correlated with various clinical variables including IgE levels, duration of asthmatic or Rhinitis_HP symptoms, skin prick test response, Peripheral_HP blood eosinophil levels, bronchial histamine reactivity and responses to nasal challenge with wheat flour. The IgG subclass antibody levels of the total cohort of bakers did not correlate with any of the measured clinical variables. However, among men specific IgG4 and IgG1 antibody levels correlated negatively with total IgE levels and duration of Rhinitis_HP, respectively. We conclude that IgG and IgG subclass levels to wheat flour in bakers reflect exposure, but that it is not related to any specific clinical situation. The exact pathogenic role of these antibodies in the development of occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Rhinitis_HP is thus not clear.

Lowered platelet glutathione peroxidase activity in patients with intrinsic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Platelet glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity and serum selenium (Se) levels were determined in 20 patients with intrinsic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Nine of the patients had NSAID-intolerance. The mean value of GSH-Px activity in the patients was 47.0 +/- 7.1 U/10(11) platelets, which is significantly lower than that of 56.4 +/- 12 U/10(11) platelets in the controls (P less than 0.01). There was also a tendency towards lowered Se levels in the patients compared with controls. The results are discussed in view of the protective role of GSH-Px against Increased_reactive_oxygen_species_production_HP and the tentative regulatory function of GSH-Px in arachidonic acid metabolism.

Inspiratory flow dynamics during mechanical ventilation in patients with Respiratory_failure_HP.We studied the effect of inspiratory flow rate on respiratory resistance during mechanical ventilation in 15 patients with Acute_HP Respiratory_failure_HP (ARF). Resistance was measured by both constant flow inflation and occlusion methods as inspiratory flow rates were increased from 0.66 to 2.0 L/s. Endotracheal tube resistance was subtracted from total resistance to obtain respiratory resistance. In contrast to the flow-dependent increase in endotracheal tube resistance, respiratory resistance decreased continuously as flow rate and airway pressure increased, except in four of six patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in whom respiratory resistance increased as flow increased. Mechanical airway Dilatation_HP, tissue resistance, stress relaxation, and time-constant inequalities may contribute to the decrease in respiratory resistance. In status asthmaticus, however, the effects of turbulence, noncompliant airways, and/or "reflex" bronchoconstriction may be sufficient to cause a flow-dependent increase in resistance.

Genetics of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Allergic_rhinitis_HP in Australian twins.The occurrence of self-reported Asthma_ASDPTO_HP/Wheezing_HP and Allergic_rhinitis_HP among 3,808 pairs of twins from the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Twin Registry was examined for evidence of genetic transmission by path analytic methods. The cumulative prevalence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP or Wheezing_HP was 13.2% and of Allergic_rhinitis_HP, 32%. There were significant correlations in liability to reported disease among twins, and these were higher in monozygotic twins (MZ) (r = 0.65) than in dizygotic twins (DZ) (r = 0.25), and in male MZ twins (r = 0.75) compared with female MZ twins (r = 0.60). Analysis under the assumptions of the classic twin model suggested that there were genetic factors common to Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Allergic_rhinitis_HP, with a correlation in genetic liability to the traits of 0.52 for men and 0.65 for women. These genes acted substantially in a nonadditive fashion in men but not in women. As the genetic correlation was significantly less than unity, this implied additional genetic factors influencing either or both diseases individually. The estimated heritability of these diseases was 60 to 70% in this population. Environmental causes of both diseases also were correlated (r = 0.53 for men and 0.33 for women). Cigarette Smoking_ASDPTO was only weakly associated with Wheezing_HP.
Genetics of asthma and hay fever in Australian twins.The occurrence of self-reported asthma/wheezing and hay fever among 3,808 pairs of twins from the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Twin Registry was examined for evidence of genetic transmission by path analytic methods.

Prevalence of occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and immunologic sensitization to psyllium among health personnel in Chronic_HP care hospitals.Psyllium is a high molecular weight laxative that can cause occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP among health care workers who prepare this product for Chronic_HPally ill patients. The prevalence of immunologic sensitization and occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP to psyllium is unknown. We investigated the personnel of four Chronic_HP care hospitals, including two where four cases of occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP had been confirmed the year preceding the trial. A questionnaire and skin prick tests with psyllium and various inhalants were administered to 193 of 248 (78%) of the workers who agreed to participate. Seventy-five subjects (39%) had a history of respiratory symptoms in normal life and/or respiratory symptoms and/or rhinoconjunctivitis after handling psyllium. Six (3%) showed skin reactivity to psyllium. Increased specific IgE antibodies were found in 20 of 162 of the sera that were tested (12%). In the second part of the study, a histamine inhalation challenge was performed on 70 of 75 (93%) of the subjects with a history suggestive of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and/or occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and/or skin reactivity to psyllium. Twenty (29%) had significant bronchial hyperresponsiveness. The six subjects with a history suggestive of occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (n = 3) and/or Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (n = 6) and/or positive skin test results to psyllium (n = 6) had significant bronchial hyperresponsiveness and increased specific IgE levels. They all underwent specific inhalation challenges with psyllium in the laboratory. Four developed bronchospastic reactions (two immediate and two dual reactions). We conclude that by including the initial four cases reported in the year preceding the initiation of this trial, the prevalence of IgE sensitization to psyllium was between 5 (skin testing) and 12% (increased specific IgE levels).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Prevalence of occupational asthma and immunologic sensitization to psyllium among health personnel in chronic care hospitals.Psyllium is a high molecular weight laxative that can cause occupational asthma among health care workers who prepare this product for chronically ill patients.

Identification of activated T lymphocytes and eosinophils in bronchial biopsies in Stable_HP atopic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.We have used immunohistochemistry and monoclonal antibodies to analyze the phenotypic composition and activation status of the cellular infiltrate of bronchial biopsies obtained by fiber optic bronchoscopy of 11 atopic asthmatic subjects (FEV1% predicted range 78 to 114), 9 atopic nonasthmatic control subjects, and 10 normal Healthy_HP subjects. Examination of mucosal biopsies obtained from both Central_HP (level I) and subsegmental (level II) bronchi showed that the highest number of CD45-, DC3-, DC4-, and CD8-positive cells were found in the group with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. There was a significant increase in the number of interleukin-2 receptor (CD25)-positive cells (a marker of lymphocyte activation) at airway level I in the asthmatic group compared with both nonasthmatic atopic (p less than 0.05) and normal control subjects (p less than 0.01). Eosinophil numbers were significantly increased in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP at both airway levels and at airway level II in the nonasthmatic atopic group when compared with normal Healthy_HP control subjects (p less than 0.05). EG2-positive cells (an index of secretion of eosinophil cationic protein following activation) were found at both airway levels in the asthmatic group and at level I in the nonasthmatic atopic control group (p less than 0.05). When asthmatic subjects were compared with normal Healthy_HP subjects, there was a reduction in the number of neutrophil elastase-positive cells in the asthmatic subjects which, as a percentage of leukocytes, was significant (p = 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

[Status_asthmaticus_HP; experience in a pediatric intensive care unit].Thirty children presenting Status_asthmaticus_HP in fifty episodes were studied during a period of three and a half years. All of them showed Acute_HP Respiratory_failure_HP secondary to Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The purpose was to evaluate treatment results and complications compared with a previous similar study conducted in our unit. We have noticed that there is a lower number of admissions for SA in our ICU and a different seasonal tendency. Precious treatment of asthmatic crisis selective inhaled beta 2 bronchodilators can prevent the ICU admission of an asthmatic patient.

[The effect of endonasal paranasal sinus surgery on lung function of patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].Lung function tests of 13 patients suffering from manifest Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and of 4 patients showing only bronchial hyperreactivity were performed before and on an average of 12 months after endonasal surgery of the paranasal sinuses. In the four subjects, bronchial hyperreactivity was no longer detectable postoperatively by provocation with carbachol. Five Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics could stop medication of 1 to 3 of their drugs, five others were able to reduce the dosage of one of their drugs to 50% or more. Lung function and medication was unchanged in two Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients, one patient had to add a drug to his medication while showing an unchanged lung function. In patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Chronic_HP paranasal Sinusitis_HP, endoscopic endonasal sinus surgery (together with flanking measures, e.g. septal correction) is able to improve antiAsthma_ASDPTO_HPtic therapy in a high percentage.

Role of insects as inhalant allergens in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP with special reference to the clinical characteristics of patients.The whole body extracts (WBEs) of 13 common insects from Delhi, namely Musca domestica (house fly); Sitophilus oryzae (rice weevil); Callosobrochous maculatus (pulse beetle); Anopheles stephensi, Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes aegypti (mosquitoes); Blattella germanica and Periplaneta americana (cockroaches: male, female and nymph); Spodoptera litura and Heliothis armigera (moths), were prepared to evaluate their allergenic significance in patients with allergic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Intradermal (ID) tests were performed with these WBEs on 75 patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and 20 Healthy_HP non-allergic volunteers. An ID test was considered positive when the weal diameter was more than twice that of phosphate-buffered saline control and at least 6 mm in size and an Erythema_HP of more than 15 mm. In the patients 27.7% of the ID tests performed were total positive (1+ to 4+) as compared to 7.1% in the controls. Ten point two per cent of ID responses were markedly positive in Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics (2+ to 4+) as against none in controls. Of the 13 bronchial provocation tests (BPTs) performed on patients giving positive cutaneous responses, eight (61.5%) were positive. Similarly, RASTs were positive in 87.5% of the limited sera tested from the patients with positive ID responses. The patients with a positive Family_history_HP of allergic disorders gave higher percentages of positive ID responses as compared to the Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics with no Family_history_HP. Similarly, the ID positivity was significantly higher in patients with associated allergic diseases like Allergic_Rhinitis_HP as compared to the patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP alone. Interestingly, we observed significantly higher ID response to insects in seasonal Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Platelet activating factor does not cause a reproducible increase in bronchial responsiveness in normal man.The reproducibility of Acute_HP effects of inhaled PAF on airway calibre, circulating neutrophil count and any subsequent increase in bronchial responsiveness has been studied in six normal subjects and compared to the effects of inhaled lyso-PAF, the inactive precursor and metabolite of PAF. PAF caused Acute_HP bronchoconstriction and a Transient_HP fall in neutrophil count on two separate occasions in five out of six subjects (minimum percentage of baseline values (mean): first PAF challenge; sGaw 69%, Vmax30 72%; neutrophil count 70%; second PAF challenge; sGaw 61%, Vmax30 74%, neutrophil count 63%). In one subject inhaled PAF caused bronchoconstriction and a Transient_HP fall in neutrophil count once, but a second challenge resulted in no detectable changes. There was no significant increase in bronchial responsiveness to methacholine in any subject studied on five occasions over a 2-week period following each PAF challenge. Challenge with lyso-PAF did not cause Acute_HP effects or any subsequent changes in bronchial responsiveness. These findings demonstrate that any effects of inhaled PAF on bronchial responsiveness in normal man are small and probably not of clinical significance. It would also be inappropriate to use this human model to study the mechanisms of bronchial hyperresponsiveness or for the preliminary assessment of potential new anti-Asthma_ASDPTO_HP drugs.

House dust mite allergen levels and an anti-mite mattress spray (natamycin) in the treatment of childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Natamycin, a fungicide marketed as Tymasil, is claimed to reduce house dust mite numbers and would therefore be expected to improve Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in children with mite sensitivity. We have tested this assertion by a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. There was no significant effect on levels of Der p I in mattress dust between active and placebo groups at the end of the spraying period. Histamine inhalation challenge PC20, clinic visit symptom scores and lung function tests reflecting either large or small airways obstruction were also unchanged. Therefore this product is not a therapeutic option for mite-allergic patients using the manufacturer's recommended dose and method of administration. Other factors influencing the Der p I levels were also investigated. Of these, only month of measurement and bedroom wall humidity showed any association.

Nocturnal_HP oxygen saturation and body movement in asthmatics treated with controlled-release preparations of theophylline or terbutaline.Nine adult asthmatics with a history of Nocturnal_HP symptoms and with morning dips in peak expiratory flow (PEF) were treated for 10-14 days with 24-h controlled-release preparation of theophylline (Th), or a controlled-release preparation of terbutaline (Te), in a double-blind cross-over experiment. During treatment with 450-900 mg Th in the evening morning, plasma drug levels ranged from 53-95 (mean 73) mumol/l. The Te dose was 7.5 mg twice daily. Morning PEF values during Th (mean 338 l.min-1) and Te (316 l.min-1) were not significantly different. There were no significant differences between the treatments in average Nocturnal_HP oximetric O2 saturation (91.9% during Th and 91.0% during Te), or the amount of Nocturnal_HP body movement, recorded with a static charge sensitive bed (total number of movements 146 during Th and 120 during Te). No difference between the treatments was seen with respect to assessment by the subjects of sleep quality, which was considered fair or good. The findings suggest that in moderately Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, Nocturnal_HP oxygenation and sleep quality were similar during the two treatments.

There were no significant differences between the treatments in average nocturnal oximetric O2 saturation (91.9% during Th and 91.0% during Te), or the amount of nocturnal body movement, recorded with a static charge sensitive bed (total number of movements 146 during Th and 120 during Te). No difference between the treatments was seen with respect to assessment by the subjects of sleep quality, which was considered fair or good. The findings suggest that in moderately severe asthma, nocturnal oxygenation and sleep quality were similar during the two treatments.
Nocturnal oxygen saturation and body movement in asthmatics treated with controlled-release preparations of theophylline or terbutaline.Nine adult asthmatics with a history of nocturnal symptoms and with morning dips in peak expiratory flow (PEF) were treated for 10-14 days with 24-h controlled-release preparation of theophylline (Th), or a controlled-release preparation of terbutaline (Te), in a double-blind cross-over experiment. During treatment with 450-900 mg Th in the evening morning, plasma drug levels ranged from 53-95 (mean 73) mumol/l. The Te dose was 7.5 mg twice daily. Morning PEF values during Th (mean 338 l.min-1) and Te (316 l.min-1) were not significantly different.

The role of pulmonary Hypertension_HP in the pathogenesis of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.In patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, when blood pressure in the pulmonary artery is measured, very often Hypertension_HP is registered. This pulmonary Hypertension_HP is not secondary to Hypoventilation_HP, as in patients with Chronic_Bronchitis_HP or Emphysema_HP, since patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP are hyperventilating. The pulmonary Hypertension_HP in them must be therefore classified as primary. It is probable that its origin is in an allergic vasoconstriction of the pulmonary artery, occurring simultaneously with the well known bronchoconstriction.

Increased serum selenium levels in patients under corticosteroid treatment.The normal serum and tissue levels of many micronutrients are remarkably Affected_HP by the therapeutical administration of several substances. In the present study, we have evaluated the modifications of serum selenium levels in different groups of patients under corticosteroid treatment. Such therapy was significantly associated with increased serum selenium levels, with a dose-dependent relationship in subjects treated with methylprednisolone. The reasons for this association are unknown. However, a reduced renal excretion of selenium, due to the mineralcorticoid activity of the corticosteroids, can be inferred.

Bronchial hyperresponsiveness in young students of southern China: relation to respiratory symptoms, diagnosed Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, and risk factors.A cross sectional study was carried out to determine the prevalence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in 3067 students aged 11-17 years in an urban and a rural area of Guangzhou (Canton), China. The methods used included a self administered questionnaire, a histamine bronchial provocation test, and allergen skinprick tests. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness was defined as a 20% fall in FEV1 and peak expiratory flow at a provoking dose of histamine (PD20) less than 7.8 mumol on two occasions four weeks apart. The response rate was 98.0% and 99.2% in the two areas. The prevalence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness was 4.1% and of diagnosed Asthma_ASDPTO_HP 2.4% in the total population. There were no significant differences in prevalence between the urban and the rural area or between boys and girls. The 11-12 year group had a higher prevalence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness (7.6%) than the older groups. Of the 125 with bronchial hyperresponsiveness, 12.0% were defined as having Severe_HP or Moderate_HP (PD20 less than 0.8 mumol), 26% Mild_HP (0.9-3.2 mumol), and 62% slight bronchial hyperresponsiveness (3.3-7.8 mumol). The Severity_HP of bronchial hyperresponsiveness was closely related to diagnosed Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, Wheezing_HP, and Cough_HP, though half the students with bronchial hyperresponsiveness were symptom free. The most common allergens were house dust and house dust mite in the city, and hay dust, pollen, and feathers in the rural area. The odds ratios for having respectively slight, Mild_HP or Moderate_HP, and Severe_HP bronchial hyperresponsiveness were 5.9, 21.0, and 30.4 for atopy; 1.9, 1.9, and 7.3 for early Respiratory_tract_infection_HP; and 3.1, 2.5, and 5.6 for a history of parental Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

[Rising admission of children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].Admissions and readmissions of children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP to the Paediatric Department, Sentralsykehuset i Akershus, increased from 197 in 1986 to 318 in 1988. The hospitalization period for children under two years of age with more than one admission has increased, which may indicate more Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP within this age group. Admissions for Pneumonia_HP have increased from 35 to 90, while admissions for Bronchiolitis_HP and laryngitis have remained Stable_HP. The distribution of number of admissions per 1,000 of the population is irregular. The Frequency_HP of admissions is no higher for the large communities around Oslo, exposed to motorways, traffic and heavy industry, than for the more rural communities. This may suggest that air pollution is not the major cause of the observed increase in the numbers of admissions to our department.

Rice pollen Allergy_HP in Taiwan.A panel of tests including intracutaneous skin testing (ST), radioallergosorbent test (RAST), immunoblotting and allergen-induced lymphoproliferation was done to study rice pollen Allergy_HP in Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic children and to characterize the allergens. Of the 312 Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients skin tested, 29 (9.3%) had positive reactions (wheal greater than or equal to 6 mm) to rice pollen extract at a concentration of 10(-5) g/mL and the remaining 283 (90.7%) were negative. While eight (34.8%) of the 23 ST-positive patients were also RAST-positive, RAST was negative in all 34 ST-negative patients and 20 normals. Immunoblotting revealed three major allergens, with molecular weights of 16 kD, 26 kD, and 32 kD, respectively. Interestingly, RAST-positive patients showed IgE responses to most allergens but only a few of them had IgG antibodies, while normal controls had stronger IgG responses to the same allergens, particularly to 32 kD, but none had IgE antibody. The preliminary results of rice pollen protein induced-lymphoproliferation were not informative; thus, rice pollen proteins do elicit a specific response in Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic children and normals, but its pathogenic role in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP needs further study.

Relationship between Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and seasonal Allergic_Rhinitis_HP in schoolchildren.The relationship between sensitization to common allergens and the development of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and seasonal Allergic_Rhinitis_HP (SAR) was investigated in a total of 419 schoolchildren in a farming community where allergens of both Dermatophagoides farinae (Df) and orchard grass (OG) pollen predominate. Twelve subjects (2.9%) were found to have Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and 35 subjects (8.4%) SAR. There was no significant association between occurrences of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and SAR. The incidence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP correlated with DF-specific IgE levels but not with OG-specific IgE levels, whereas that of SAR correlated with OG-specific IgE levels but not with Df-specific IgE levels. No significant correlation was detected between IgE antibody levels against Df and OG. These results suggest that Asthma_ASDPTO_HP occurs independently of SAR.

Validation of an Asthma_ASDPTO_HP knowledge questionnaire.Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is responsible for much morbidity and mortality, which might be decreased by increasing parental and patient knowledge about Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. This report describes the development and validation of an Asthma_ASDPTO_HP knowledge questionnaire for use in the assessment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP knowledge. Two groups of respondents were examined. One group was designated 'high knowledge' and the other 'low knowledge'. The questionnaire had a maximum possible score of 31. The mean score of 69 'high' knowledge parents was 25.3 (median 25, range 18-31). By contrast, the mean score of 69 'low' knowledge parents was 13.0 (median 13, range 0-21). The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P less than 0.0001). The questionnaire results were reproducible (tau = 0.94, P less than 0.01). Demographic characteristics such as education and socio-economic status were not important confounding variables. Face and content validity of the questionnaire were based on reference to published experience. Concurrent validity was demonstrated by the ability of the questionnaire to distinguish low from high knowledge parents. The questionnaire should prove to be a valuable research tool for the assessment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP knowledge either as part of an educational intervention or in a clinical situation.

A system to capture physical examination data suitable for paediatric practice.A method is described to capture data on the physical examination of children. A personal computer with a keyboard, keypad and screen is used along with a menu driven software package. Little knowledge of computing is necessary and the system can be used to produce hard copy when a suitable printer is added. Accumulated data may be transferred to a statistical package for future analysis. The method used to capture data from children with respiratory disease, particularly Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, is described here, but it is stressed that the method can be adapted easily to data collection from the results of the physical examination of any system.

Once-daily theophylline in the treatment of Nocturnal_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The efficacy and side-effects of individually adjusted doses of controlled-release theophylline given once daily in the evening (average dose 650 mg) were compared with those of standard treatment with controlled-release terbutaline 7.5 mg b.d. Thirty-six asthmatics with regular morning obstruction ("morning dipping") were studied over two treatment periods each of two weeks, according to a crossover, randomized, double blind design. Morning peak expiratory flow (PEF) was slightly but significantly higher with theophylline (363 l.min-1) than terbutaline (342 l.min-1). Feelings of dyspnoea on waking in the morning were also less pronounced with theophylline. There were no other differences between the treatment periods during the day or night, with respect to dyspnoea or any the other symptoms. Side-effects were Mild_HP and were reported with similar frequencies during both treatments. It is concluded than an individually adjusted dose of once-daily theophylline administered in the evening is at least as effective as conventional therapy with controlled-release terbutaline in preventing Nocturnal_HP and early morning Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, when both drugs are added to regular medication with inhaled sympathomimetics and steroids.

Comparison of the efficacy and systemic effects of 4 mg and 8 mg formulations of salbutamol controlled release in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The purpose of the present study was to compare the efficacy and systemic effects of 4 mg and 8 mg doses of salbutamol controlled release (SCR) after single dosing and at steady state in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Fifteen asthmatic patients (Age 36 y, FEV1 85% predicted) were given SCR 4 mg and 8 mg twice daily for 7 days in a randomised double-blind cross-over design, with at least 7 days washout between treatments. There were no differences between the bronchodilator effects of 4 mg and 8 mg doses. There was no evidence of tolerance to the bronchodilator effects after Chronic_HP dosing. Morning and evening PEFR measurements also showed improvements during treatment with SCR 4 mg and SCR 8 mg, although there were no differences between the two formulations. Both doses of SCR caused significant objective Tremor_HP responses which were maintained after Chronic_HP dosing. The 8 mg dose produced a larger Tremor_HP response after single dosing, but not at steady-state. Subjective Tremor_HP occurred in 7 patients with SCR 8 mg, and in 2 patients with SCR 4 mg. There were no Arrhythmia_HP on Holter ECG monitoring. These results suggest that the 8 mg dose of SCR was no more effective than the 4 mg formulation, and was associated with more systemic adverse effects.

Investigation of the effect of ketotifen on alcohol-induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP: a case study.A male patient with bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP suffered Severe_HP exacerbation of symptoms after drinking alcohol and this was not prevented by treatment with bronchodilators. After taking 1 mg ketotifen twice daily for Nasal_obstruction_HP, within 1 month there was no longer any exacerbation of symptoms by alcohol. Blood samples were taken and Peripheral_HP eosinophils were purified and incubated with beer antigen. Using a chemiluminescence method, it was shown that pretreatment with ketotifen dose dependently inhibited the generation of the highly reactive oxygen metabolite superoxide (O2-) by the eosinophils. It is proposed that ketotifen prevented the alcohol-exacerbated Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attacks by inhibiting the release of tissue-damaging superoxide from eosinophils.

The effect of chlorpheniramine on Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Patients with Stable_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP can tolerate antihistamines without any significant deleterious effects both on a short- and a long-term basis. In addition, patients with steroid-dependent Asthma_ASDPTO_HP appear to tolerate antihistamines without any significant deleterious effects. Therefore, oral chlorpheniramine does not appear to have ill effects on patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Warning labels required by the FDA for antihistamine use in asthmatics are unnecessary.

Acetylator phenotype in patients with allergic diseases and its clinical significance.The genetic polymorphism of drug acetylation rate in man is an important determinant of the toxic and therapeutic response to certain drugs. This polymorphism can alter not only drug effects but may be a factor influencing the Frequency_HP of the occurrence of some disease states. The aim of our study was to establish whether there exists any correlation between the acetylator phenotype and the development of allergic diseases. In patients with allergic diseases and in Healthy_HP persons as a control group, the acetylation phenotype was determined by the sulfadimidinic method. In the group of patients with allergic diseases without infectional factor 76% slow and 24% rapid acetylators were found. This predominance of slow acetylators was statistically significant (by using chi 2 test) with comparison to the group of Healthy_HP persons, where 49% slow and 51% rapid acetylators were observed. Considerable predominance of slow acetylators in patients with allergic diseases suggest that phenotype of slow acetylation may be a factor playing some role in pathogenesis of allergic diseases and may be a factor predisposing to the development of these diseases.

Adherence issues in the medical management of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is a common Chronic_HP illness of childhood that requires coordinated efforts by children, families, and health care professionals for proper medical management. The medical management of pediatric Asthma_ASDPTO_HP involves pharmacological and behavioral recommendations to both prevent and control Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attacks. However, management of these attacks is hindered by failure to adhere to the prescribed recommendations. While the literature on adherence in pediatric Asthma_ASDPTO_HP has grown over the past 10 years, few definitive statements can be made about causes and treatment. Various issues related to adherence and pediatric Asthma_ASDPTO_HP are reviewed in this paper, including assessment methods, factors influencing adherence, and treatment strategies. Recommendations for future research are provided, starting with more controlled randomized studies.

Occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP due to spot-welding.A case of occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP from fumes due to spot-welding is described. The hazards from resistance welding have been considered minimal as compared to other types of welding. This paper illustrates the possible hazards of occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP among welders including those doing spot-welding. It also illustrates the difficulties encountered in identifying the specific causative agent in such cases.

[A novel liquid-phase enzyme immunoassay AlaSTAT for IgE antibody determination].To determine whether a novel liquid-phase enzyme immunoassay AlaSTAT for allergen-specific IgE antibody determination can be used to measure the absolute amounts of serum IgE antibodies, we examined the amounts of anti-house dust (HD) and anti-mite IgE antibodies in sera of 32 HD-sensitized allergic asthmatics and 14 normal subjects by this immunoassay. The amounts of anti-mite IgE antibody in serum measured by this immunoassay were found to be consistent with those assessed by the difference in serum total IgE proteins before and after the absorption with mite allergen (the value determined by this immunoassay was 113% of the latter one, n = 4). Neither nonspecific IgE protein (50 to 10000 IU/ml) nor the heat-inactivated blocking serum Affected_HP the measurement of allergen-specific IgE antibody by the liquid-phase immunoassay. There were strong correlations between the values of anti-HD and anti-mite IgE antibodies by RAST and those by AlaSTAT (r = 0.90, p less than 0.001 and r = 0.86, p less than 0.001, n = 46, respectively). Our results indicate that the commercially available liquid-phase allergen-specific IgE enzyme immunoassay can be used to measure the absolute amounts of serum IgE antibodies without interference of nonspecific IgE protein or IgG blocking antibody.

[Study on the Frequency_HP and clinical significance of positive RAST for mould allergen in Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients].Recently, moulds are considered to be important allergens for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. To confirm this fact, 76 Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients (mean age 12.5, range 6-17 years) admitted to National Chubu Hospital were investigated for 16 different mould allergens by Pharmacia RAST RIA to measure specific-IgE for moulds. The results were as follows. 1) The Frequency_HP of positive RASTs (score greater than or equal to 2) varied from 4% to 21% depending on the allergen. Because 21 patients were RAST positive to one or more allergens, ultimately 26 patients (34%) appeared to be RAST positive to more than one of the 16 mould allergens. 2) According to the number of positive RASTs, the patients were divided into 3 groups, i.e. group 1 with more than five, group 2 with less than four and group 3 with zero. The ratio of patients with Severe_HP and Moderate_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP to the total subjects was not significantly different between three groups before admission, but significantly high in group 1 and group 2 in order compared to groups 3 (chi 2(4)df = 18.81, p less than 0.005) one year after admission. This tendency was already apparent even one month after admission. 3) The Frequency_HP of positive RASTs for mould allergens was higher in patients with Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP than in those without it. From these results, positive RAST for mould allergen seems to have considerable influence to intractable Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP in young Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients.

From these results, positive RAST for mould allergen seems to have considerable influence to intractable asthma and atopic dermatitis in young asthmatic patients.
[Study on specific IgE antibodies in pediatric allergic patients by CAP system].The CAP system is a new method to detect specific IgE antibodies and is an advanced method of the traditional paper disc RAST. Our result suggests a significant correlation between scores obtained with the CAP system and those with the traditional RAST. Since specific IgE antibodies against multiple allergens can be measured with the CAP system, we studied 5 food allergen specific IgE antibodies (Fx5) in cases of infantile Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP. This study indicates a good correlation between the Fx5 scores and clinical symptoms of these patients. Thus, it is concluded that the CAP system is useful for screening IgE antibodies against multiple food allergens in cases of infantile Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP.

[Posture and circadian variations in serum theophylline concentrations].We have reported that the morning mean rate of absorption (ka) in immediate release aminophylline tablet is significantly faster than the evening one without any obvious change in AUC, the distribution (Vd), the rate of elimination (kel) or the elimination half-time (t1/2) and this altered absorption is a cause of circadian variation of theophylline concentrations with sustained-release preparations. Now, we examined the effect of posture on theophylline absorption. Seven asthmatic children were given immediate release aminophylline tablets at the same time in the morning on two separate occasions. On one day they remained standing and on the other lying. Serum theophylline concentration was measured at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 hours after dosing. Mean theophylline levels were higher in the standing Position_HP at all time and only the mean rate of absorption (ka) was significantly faster without any obvious change in parameters of pharmacokinetics. This result was almost consistent with differences of day and night theophylline kinetics. We conclude that slowness of absorption in the evening is mainly induced by difference in posture.

First-time treatment with steroids in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP: comparison of the effects of inhaled beclomethasone and of oral prednisone on airway function, bronchial reactivity and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.In a double-blind cross-over study of 12 Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients the effects of 1,000 micrograms.day-1 beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) on airway function, bronchial reactivity and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis have been compared to those of 15 mg.day-1 oral prednisone (PRD). None of the patients had ever received corticosteroids before. Fourteen days treatment with either of both steroids improved airway function, both subjectively and objectively. Both steroids slightly reduced the responsiveness to histamine. PRD suppressed the corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) stimulated cortisol release more than BDP did, whereas there was no significant change in adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) release. The results indicate that short-term treatment with 1,000 micrograms.day-1 BDP reduces bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR) in Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients, whilst having subtle effects on HPA axis.

The relationship between bronchial immunopathology and hyperresponsiveness in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Physiological and Immunopathological parameters were investigated in 15 patients with diagnosed Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, and 6 non-asthmatics presenting with other chest symptoms. The 15 symptom-free asthmatics expressed bronchohyperresponsiveness with a mean provocative dose producing a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (PD20FEV1) of 1 mg histamine. None of the non-asthmatics responded to 16 mg histamine. Twenty four hours later bronchoscopy was performed and endobronchial biopsies were obtained. Histological staining of frozen biopsy sections revealed a mononuclear cell infiltrate in all 15 asthmatics, while only 1 of the 6 non-asthmatics showed Mild_HP inflammation. Monoclonal antibodies were used to identify subsets of lymphocytes, activation markers, macrophages, and HLA-DR expression within the peribronchial infiltrates. In all samples, activated T-cells and macrophages were identified and HLA-DR expression was found to be raised, but the CD4: CD8 ratio was highly variable. No clear relationship was found between cellular distribution and measured lung function parameters. A highly significant correlation was found between the level of HLA-DR expression on the infiltrating cells (quantified microdensitometrically) and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. These results show for the first time that a Chronic_HP T-cell-mediated immune response is present in the bronchial tissue of asymptomatic asthmatics, and that the HLA-DR expression promoted correlates with the hyperresponsive status. These data promote the hypothesis that a T-cell-mediated response contributes to a predisposition to bronchial hyperresponsiveness in asthmatics.

Depression_ASDPTO, self-esteem, and life events in adolescents with Chronic_HP diseases.This study assesses whether nonhospitalized adolescents with Chronic_HP diseases differ from their Healthy_HP peers on standardized measurements of Depression_ASDPTO, self-esteem, and life events. The study group consisted of 80 patients (20 with sickle cell disease, 40 with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, and 20 with diabetes). All patients had been admitted at least twice in the preceding year, had their disease for at least 2 years, and were between the ages of 12 and 18. The control group consisted of 100 adolescents, matched for age and socioeconomic status, from local schools. All subjects completed a questionnaire compiled from the Beck Depression_ASDPTO Inventory (BDI), the Rosenberg Scale of Self-Esteem, and the McCutcheon Life Events Checklist. Adolescents with Chronic_HP disease had higher Depression_ASDPTO scores (p less than 0.001) and lower self-esteem (p less than 0.001) than their Healthy_HP age-matched controls. There was no statistically significant difference in life events between the Chronic_HP disease and control groups. Depression_ASDPTO, self-esteem, and life events did not differ significantly among the three disease groups. These findings suggest a need for intervention strategies to address Depression_ASDPTO and low self-esteem in adolescents with Chronic_HP disease.

Comparison of the effects of inhaled corticosteroids on the airway response to histamine, methacholine, Hyperventilation_HP, and sulfur dioxide in subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.To investigate whether inhaled steroids modulate the airway response to different bronchoconstrictive stimuli, we studied 25 subjects with Mild_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP with a double-blind, noncrossover design to compare the effect of a 3-week treatment with salbutamol (0.2 mg, four times a day [q.i.d.]) and placebo (N = 11) to the effect of salbutamol (0.2 mg q.i.d.) and inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP, 0.5 mg q.i.d.) (N = 14). Airway response to histamine and methacholine was assessed as the provocative concentration (in milligrams per milliliter) necessary to increase the specific airway resistance (SRaw) (in centimeters of H2O times second) by 100% (PC100 SRaw). Airway response to Hyperventilation_HP of air and to Hyperventilation_HP of 0.75 ppm of sulfur dioxide (SO2) was determined as the provocative ventilation (in liters per minute) necessary to increase SRaw by 75% (PV75 SRaw). Challenges were performed on separate days before and after treatment, and salbutamol inhalation was withheld at least 6 hours before each challenge. Salbutamol and placebo did not change perchallenge baseline SRaw nor did they have any significant effect on the airway response to the stimuli. Salbutamol and BDP decreased the mean prechallenge baseline SRaw (SEM) from 7.7 (0.37) to 5.9 (0.28) (p less than 0.01) and significantly (p less than 0.01) increased geometric mean (SEM) PC100 SRaw for histamine from 0.5 (1.42) to 0.9 (1.53) mg/ml; for methacholine, from 0.2 (1.47) to 0.5 (1.51) mg/ml; and mean (SEM) PV75 SRaw for Hyperventilation_HP of air from 51.8 (2.32) to 58.4 (1.86) L/min. In contrast, the change of PV75 SRaw during Hyperventilation_HP of SO2 from 26.2 (2.29) to 31.4 (3.30) L/min was not significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Status_asthmaticus_HP: an analysis of 560 episodes and comparison between mechanical and non-mechanical ventilation groups.An analysis and comparison of 286 adult patients involving 560 episodes of Status_asthmaticus_HP admitted to the Medical Service of Chulalongkorn Hospital during the years 1984 through 1988 were examined. There were 58 patients who required mechanical ventilation 75 times compared with 228 patients with 485 episodes of attack who did not require the use of mechanical ventilation. The increased risk factors for Status_asthmaticus_HP among those who required assisted ventilation were as follows: younger age at Onset_HP of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, younger age of Severe_HP attack, Chronic_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (especially unstable Asthma_ASDPTO_HP), previous history of intubation and mechanical ventilation, shorter duration of Severe_HP attack and extremely Severe_HP attack in the sitting Position_HP before arriving at the emergency room, receiving beta 2 adrenergic inhaler, mistakenly taking beta blockers, high Fever_HP (over 38 degrees C) as a result of Respiratory_tract_infection_HP, increased initial pulse rate (over 125 beats/minute) and white blood cell count of over 16,000/mm3, and Pneumothorax_HP on admission. Simple Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and history of taking franol or tedral in Status_asthmaticus_HP indicated a low risk for mechanical ventilation. The taking of glucocorticoids did not pose a risk to Status_asthmaticus_HP requiring mechanical ventilation.

An immunologic and genetic study of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in workers in an aluminum smelter.The cause or causes of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP among employees in aluminum smelters is unknown. We attempted to ascertain whether such workers who developed Asthma_ASDPTO_HP differed in respect to indices of immunological function and certain genetic markers. Data were collected from 33 asthmatic and 127 nonasthmatic potroom workers. asthmatic workers had significantly lower mean serum levels of immunoglobulin (Ig)M; however, mean levels of IgG and IgA, median levels of IgE, the capacity for recall of delayed type hypersensitivity, levels of immune complexes, and Frequency_HP of antinuclear or other autoantibodies did not differ from values for nonasthmatic workers. Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was found to develop on a background of atopy in 21 workers (64%), whereas there were no features of atopy in 12 workers (36%). Cigarette Smoking_ASDPTO had independent effects on immunological function. In respect to genetic markers, there was a higher Frequency_HP among asthmatic workers of the alpha-1-anti-trypsin deficiency phenotype MS, but the Frequency_HP of blood groups, Gm allotypes, or human leucocyte antigen types was similar. The study established that the profile of immune function, or genetic markers tested, did not differ essentially for workers in an aluminum smelter who did or did not develop Asthma_ASDPTO_HP; however, there was an indication of Heterogeneous_HP in causation, as judged by "atopy-related" and "non-atopy-related" groups in the Asthma_ASDPTO_HP population.

[Clinical characteristics of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in the elderly in relation to cell component in the airways].Cellular responses in the airways of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, which might be Affected_HP with aging, were compared between 28 elderly (60 years old or more) and 28 younger (40 years old or less) patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The cellular responses were observed to differentiate 500 cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), excluding epithelial cells. The average Frequency_HP of each type of cell in the BALF of the elderly Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics was 65.7% for macrophages, 15.5% for lymphocytes, 8.9% for neutrophils and 9.5% for eosinophils. In the younger Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics the average Frequency_HP was 61.8% for macrophages, 17.1% for lymphocytes, 4.1% for neutrophils and 16.1% for eosinophils. A significant increase in the Frequency_HP of neutrophils in BALF of the elderly cases was observed in steroid-dependent intractable Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics compared to the younger cases (p less than 0.05). An increase in Frequency_HP of eosinophils in the younger cases was also observed, although the difference in the Frequency_HP was not significant between the elderly and the younger intractable cases. A significant difference in the Frequency_HP of each type of cell in the clinical type of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was not present between the elderly and the younger cases. However, the Frequency_HP of neutrophils in elderly cases was significantly increased in Ib. Bronchospasm_HP + hypersecretion type compared to Ia. Bronchospasm_HP type (p less than 0.05), and was more elevated in II. bronchiolar obstruction type (p less than 0.01).

[Clinical characteristics of bronchial asthma in the elderly in relation to cell component in the airways].Cellular responses in the airways of bronchial asthma, which might be affected with aging, were compared between 28 elderly (60 years old or more) and 28 younger (40 years old or less) patients with bronchial asthma. The cellular responses were observed to differentiate 500 cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), excluding epithelial cells. The average frequency of each type of cell in the BALF of the elderly asthmatics was 65.7% for macrophages, 15.5% for lymphocytes, 8.9% for neutrophils and 9.5% for eosinophils. In the younger asthmatics the average frequency was 61.8% for macrophages, 17.1% for lymphocytes, 4.1% for neutrophils and 16.1% for eosinophils. A significant increase in the frequency of neutrophils in BALF of the elderly cases was observed in steroid-dependent intractable asthmatics compared to the younger cases (p less than 0.05). An increase in frequency of eosinophils in the younger cases was also observed, although the difference in the frequency was not significant between the elderly and the younger intractable cases.

Left_HP-handedness: association with college major, familial sinistrality, Allergies_ASDPTO, and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.366 juniors, seniors, and graduate students from seven departments at The Ohio State University were administered the 10-item Edinburgh Handedness Inventory and asked questions concerning familial handedness and personal incidence of Allergies_ASDPTO or Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The rate of Left_HP-handedness was 15.6% among the male students and 12.9% among the females. Maternal handedness was significantly related to female offspring handedness and to the incidence of Allergies_ASDPTO and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in both males and females. Departmental incidence of Left_HP-handedness ranged from a low of 7.5% (Microbiology) to a high of 21.7% (Law).

[Mortality of Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in Danish intensive care units in 1988. A questionnaire study].The mortality due to Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is gradually increasing in Denmark. In 1988, 209 patients died from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Of these patients, 108 were under 70 years. Information about patients who died from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in Danish intensive care units (ICU) in 1988 was obtained retrospectively by questionnaires. 99% of all the ICU's replied. Eleven of the abovementioned patients died in an ICU because of inadequate oxygenation or ventilation. In cases where an anaesthesiologist was called to a patient with Acute_HP Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, who subsequently died from the disease, the majority had developed Cardiac_arrest_HP, when the anaesthesiologist arrived. The use of objective monitoring of the degree of pulmonary obstruction by use of peak flow measurements and series of arterial blood gas values is recommended. Hypoxemia_HP, the main risk factor, might be revealed in time by measurements of pulseoximetry. If the arterial PCO2 is increasing, the patient should be monitored in an ICU in view of oxygenation and ventilation, and possibly mechanical ventilation.

[Environment of the asthmatic child].This work is in the purview of epidemiological studies that concern the environment of asthmatic children. Infantile Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is found especially in children who live in the country, in an electrically-heated house and who sleep in a badly orientated room. The environment is composed of feather-bedding, soft-toy animals and animals from the countryside. The role of tobacco and insufficient aeration has been shown in this enquiry. School attendance is not disturbed by development of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The majority of teachers do not understand infantile Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. This study is to emphasize the importance of the environment in the development of allergic infantile Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and the possibilities of its prevention. Information to the teachers, as well as the treating physicians, is also necessary for prevention.

[Food_Allergy_HP in childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].Food_Allergy_HP is responsible for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in 6% of cases, all ages together, with the same etiology. As in a adults, the influence of atopy is indisputable and is proved by the presence of familial and personal antecedents and rise in total IgE. Proof of Food_Allergy_HP is based only on tests of exclusion and reintroduction and/or provocation tests, under control of spirometry and plasma histamine. Eggs, milk, wheat, fish, potato, pork meat are the foods most frequently associated. A comparative study of Food_Allergy_HP in adult Asthma_ASDPTO_HP shows that cow milk and eggs are most frequently responsible, as in children. For Diagnosis_ASDPTO, specific IgE RAST is more often correlated (65%) with the clinical condition than skin tests (60%).

Acute_HP care of Mild_HP to moderately Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in 1990.When considering the Acute_HP treatment of Mild_HP to moderately Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in the outpatient or emergency room setting, the author indicates how older, effective modalities of care can be replaced with modalities which are at least as effective but also teach the patient how to care for himself. Older approaches including epinephrine injections, intravenous aminophylline, intravenous superhydration, nebulizer-generated aerosols, and oxygen have the disadvantage of binding the patient to the emergency room for future attacks. By stressing proper use of sympathomimetic metered-dose inhalers (often with a spacer), oral theophyllines, oral B-2 agonists, oral and inhaled corticosteroids, the 90% of patients well enough to go home after treatment will have had a lasting educational experience designed to increase their self-reliance and make further ER visits unnecessary.

[Immunoglobulin G subclass deficiency in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Chronic_HP obstructive Bronchitis_HP].In 99 patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP or Chronic_HP obstructive Bronchitis_HP immunoglobulins and immunoglobulin-G subclasses were measured to characterize the Frequency_HP of humoral immune deficiencies. 26 patients had decreased serum levels in one or two IgG subclasses. So IgG-subclass deficiency is a common finding in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and obstructive Bronchitis_HP. Treatment with corticosteroids seems to promote low IgG-subclass levels, but cannot fully explain alterations of IgG subclasses. Today IgG-subclass deficiencies are regarded as an important factor in the susceptibility to Recurrent_HP_infections_HP. We think, variation in IgG subclasses may have further effects on the noninfectious inflammatory processes of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and obstructive Bronchitis_HP.

Plasma prostaglandin levels from bronchial asthmatic patients assayed by 9-anthryldiazomethane-HPLC method.Plasma prostaglandin (PG) and thromboxane (Tx) levels from bronchial asthmatic patients were assayed by 9-anthryldiazomethane reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography method. TxB2 levels from Stable_HP bronchial asthmatic patients were significantly higher than those from normal Healthy_HP subjects. PGF2 alpha levels were significantly elevated in atopic patients compared with nonatopic ones. PG patterns differed between asthmatic and nonasthmatic conditions in the same patients. PGF2 alpha levels were significantly elevated in the patients with spontaneous attacks compared with those without attacks and 6-keto PGF1 alpha levels were significantly lower in bronchial asthmatic patients having attacks than in the patients without attacks. There were no significant differences of PG levels between Mild_HP and Moderate_HP asthmatic subjects. Aminophylline injection in patients with Mild_HP spontaneous attacks had no significant effects on PG levels which were compared before and after injection.

Environmental control of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP self-management.We describe a model of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP self-management based on environmental control of behavior. The model emphasizes aspects of the environment that either prompt or strengthen Asthma_ASDPTO_HP self-management behavior. In prompting behavior, environmental events function as behavioral cues; in strengthening behavior, they represent reinforcers. We describe concepts related to cueing and reinforcement, and how these operations might be incorporated in individualized self-management programs. Finally, we discuss evidence supporting Asthma_ASDPTO_HP self-management programs based on environmental control behavior.

Asthma_ASDPTO_HP education: the perceptions of family physicians.Education and training are important for people with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and for their family doctors in order to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease, but the most appropriate educational strategies have not been clarified. This study was conducted as a needs-assessment survey to examine the perceptions of 193 family physicians in Sydney (Australia) regarding various aspects of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP management and patient education. Part of this sample of physicians were subsequently involved in a communitywide Asthma_ASDPTO_HP education program. Although the measurement of airway function by doctors and patients is the cornerstone of the national Asthma_ASDPTO_HP strategy in Australia, only 43% of family physicians surveyed regularly measured airway function in their offices and most considered that their patients rarely used a peak flow meter. Most physicians agreed with statements suggesting that Asthma_ASDPTO_HP education was useful but some felt that education could be dangerous, or might result in fewer consultations by Asthma_ASDPTO_HP patients. These results have provided clear directions for educating family physicians about optimal Asthma_ASDPTO_HP management. They also provide some insight into potential barriers to the successful implementation of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP education programs.

A portable system for the spectral analysis of Cough_HP sounds in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.A practical and portable method is described to analyze the sound spectra of Cough_HPs. The system is based upon a personal computer and simultaneously collects the sounds of Cough_HP heard both at the mouth and through the chest wall together with the airflow at the mouth produced during the Cough_HP. Subsequent analysis produce spectrographs of the Cough_HP sound linked to the corresponding airflow. The system will be used initially to examine the effects of exercise on the sound of Cough_HP in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Further study of Cough_HP spectra in this way may be useful in the management of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP either diagnostically or in the assessment of therapeutic interventions.

[A case of successfully managed Acute_HP asthmatic attack by cervical epidural block during mechanical ventilation].A 47-year-old male suffering from an Acute_HP asthmatic attack was admitted in the morning. He was arrested on arrival. Following successful resuscitation, he was treated by using controlled ventilation with a Bennett 7200 respirator. Before starting mechanical ventilation, he was physically exhausted and had carbon dioxide retention (PaCO2 76.2 mmHg). The patient received dexamethasone 40 mg/day and theophylline 400 mg/day during the first 4 days. Despite the decrease in PaCO2 following mechanical ventilation, cycling pressure remained high (up to 50-70 cmH2O) even after 24 hours. Because of the risk of barotrauma due to high cycling pressure, we conducted cervical epidural block to reduce airway hyperreactivity to the endotracheal tube and endotracheal suctioning. Six to 10 ml of lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine was administered every 1 or 2 hours. Within 4 hours after epidural block, airway pressure decreased to 30-40 cmH2O. Since then, requirements of sedative (diazepam) have decreased greatly to 10 mg/day. The patient was successfully extubated 4 days after admission. Finally, epidural block was continued for 6 days without any complication. We do not know how cervical epidural block works to reduce airway pressure. It might be beneficial to manage patients artificially ventilated during asthmatic attack.

Placebo controlled trial of systemic corticosteroids in Acute_HP childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.In a randomised controlled trial 38 asthmatic children aged 2-11 yr who had not received regular oral or inhaled steroids during the previous year, were treated with a standard regime of nebulised salbutamol and intravenous aminophylline plus either hydrocortisone and oral prednisolone for 5 days, or placebo. The children were observed throughout their hospital stay and for 3 months afterwards. There was a greater fall in heart rates in the steroid treated group on the second day of treatment (mean diff. 16 beats/min) and at discharge (mean diff. 13 beats/min); p less than 0.025. Peak Expiratory Flow Rates recorded in 26 children, 13 in each group, showed more improvement on day 2 in those given steroids (mean diff 16% predicted); p less than 0.05. This difference was not apparent at discharge but 9 children treated with steroids were clinically wheeze-free when they Left_HP hospital compared with 3 in the placebo group, p less than 0.05. There were no differences in respiratory rate, pulsus paradoxus and arterial oxygen saturation. Trends in duration of hospital stay and relapse rate during the succeeding 3 months favoured active treatment. These findings support the use of systemic corticosteroids in addition to high dose bronchodilators to treat 'non steroid dependent' children hospitalised with Acute_HP Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Adenosine bronchoconstriction in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP: investigations into its possible mechanism of action.1. Inhaled adenosine and its parent nucleotide, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) provoke bronchoconstriction in atopic and asthmatic individuals but not in normal subjects. 2. In clinical studies, histamine H1-receptor antagonists, cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors and the mast cell 'stabilising' drugs, sodium cromoglycate and nedocromil, protect against the effects of adenosine bronchoprovocation suggesting the involvement of secondary mast cell mediator release. 3. Adenosine and its analogues potentiate histamine and leukotriene release from mast cells activated by other stimuli in vitro, and may also increase net mediator release from mast cells by counteracting the inhibitory effect of circulating adrenaline. 4. Although adenosine fulfils many of the criteria required for a mediator in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, its importance is not fully understood, and the mechanisms by which it provokes bronchoconstriction in asthmatic subjects is far from concluded. 5. Two possibilities are that either adenosine acts directly on luminal mast cells to upregulate histamine secretion, or it acts to initiate neuronal reflexes which stimulate histamine release indirectly and possibly activate peptidergic and/or cholinergic pathways.

[Effects of bronchial secretions of patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Chronic_Bronchitis_HP on the motility of ciliated cells of the ciliated epithelium].It has been shown that bronchial mucus from patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Chronic_Bronchitis_HP can produce a ciliostatic effect when incubated with strips of frog palate mucosa. This effect can more often be found during clinical exacerbation and is supposed to be reversible. The ciliostatically active samples of bronchial mucus taken from Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients markedly inhibit reactivation glycerol models of frog's ciliated epithelium. It can therefore be suggested that the found activity acts directly on tubulin-dynein complex of the cilia. In contrast to these findings, the ciliostatically active samples of bronchial of glycerol models and therefore possibly act through some other mechanism.

Cardiac Asthma_ASDPTO_HP presenting as status asthmaticus: deleterious effect of epinephrine therapy.Epinephrine is a potent bronchodilator currently used to treat Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, although there is no proven advantage of this drug over beta 2 adrenergic agonists. By contrast, as demonstrated here, the use of such a potent vasoconstrictor can worsen hemodynamic status when Left_HP_ventricular_dysfunction_HP is associated with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP or is the cause for Dyspnea_HP. We describe the case of a 60-year-old man with an history of Chronic_HP asthmatic Bronchitis_HP admitted for status asthmaticus. Bronchodilator therapy, including high dosages of intravenous epinephrine, failed to improve the patient and he was intubated and mechanically ventilated. Several hours later, a Right_HP heart catheterization revealed Severe_HP unexpected Left_HP heart dysfunction with a capillary wedge pressure of 45 mmHg and a cardiac index of 1.7 l/min/m2. Epinephrine was gradually stopped which resulted in a decrease in mean arterial blood pressure and an improvement of hemodynamic status. He was discharged on home mechanical ventilation. In this patient, ischemic Left_HP Congestive_heart_failure_HP was revealed by a clinical picture mimicking status asthmaticus. Epinephrine, given as bronchodilator therapy on an empiric basis precipitated the patient into Cardiogenic_Shock_HP. Therefore this drug should not be recommended in face of the possibility of cardiac Asthma_ASDPTO_HP or associated cardiac dysfunction.
Cardiac asthma presenting as status asthmaticus: deleterious effect of epinephrine therapy.Epinephrine is a potent bronchodilator currently used to treat severe asthma, although there is no proven advantage of this drug over beta 2 adrenergic agonists. By contrast, as demonstrated here, the use of such a potent vasoconstrictor can worsen hemodynamic status when left ventricular dysfunction is associated with asthma or is the cause for dyspnea. We describe the case of a 60-year-old man with an history of chronic asthmatic bronchitis admitted for status asthmaticus. Bronchodilator therapy, including high dosages of intravenous epinephrine, failed to improve the patient and he was intubated and mechanically ventilated.

In this patient, ischemic left heart failure was revealed by a clinical picture mimicking status asthmaticus.

[Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and air pollution. A study of admissions to the Hospital of Saint-Nazaire].To test the possible influence of atmospheric pollution on the Frequency_HP of asthmatic exacerbations we have looked to see whether there is a link between the number of daily admissions for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in hospitals in Saint-Nazaire and data from pollution sensors in the network of the Association for the Measurement of Atmospheric Pollution in the Loire estuary. The pollutions studied were sulphur dioxide, oxide of nitrogen (NOx) and non sedimenting dust (black smoke). The meteorological data (speed and direction of the wind and temperature) were also recorded. The study was carried out for 18 months in a retrospective fashion. During this period 372 hospital admissions were recorded in 229 subjects. The number of daily admissions correlated in a significant fashion with the level of black smoke (r = 0.149, p less than 0.001) and this result was particularly due to subjects who were less than 15 years old. In this group the Frequency_HP of hospital admission was doubled on those days when the level of smoke was at its most elevated. There was a weak link between the peaks of SO2 (r = 0.116, p less than 0.05). An analysis of the place of residence in those hospitals and the dominant direction of the wind did not enable us to confirm the role of the principal sources of industrial pollution, which were all situated to the east of Saint-Nazaire.

[Effects of individualized aerobic training in the readaptation of the asthmatic child to exercise].There have been few works studying the effects of training in asthmatics and there does not yet exist any study utilising the idea of the individualization of training. This is why the aim of this study was to assess the value of the effects of individualised aerobic training on cardio-respiratory aptitude in the asthmatic child. This study was carried out on two populations of asthmatics, swimmers and non-swimmers matched for age, height, degree of bronchial obstruction during a remission and baseline of physical fitness. Each child in the swimming group was trained to a metabolic level corresponding to the ventilatory threshold. After a period of 3 months a second cardio-respiratory evaluation was carried out. A clear cut improvement (20%) of VO2 max was observed as well as a proportional elevation of the ventilatory threshold in the swimming group. The VE max, the VT max, the VT/Timax, the FC max and the maximal oxygen uptake were also recorded. On the other hand aerobic training seems to be without effect on resting pulmonary function, even if the clinical state of the children improved. In conclusion this study shows that aerobic training closely adapted to the level of each child, obtains an important and rapid gain in cardio-respiratory fitness which leads to a better exercise adaptation. In addition the progression of the ventilatory threshold implies an increased capacity for work without the appearance of Hyperventilation_HP. This enables an understanding of how aerobic training is generally accompanied in the asthmatic with a better respiratory comfort and argues in favour of the perfect efficacy of this type of reconditioning in the re-adaptation to effort in these patients.

Increasing Asthma_ASDPTO_HP prevalence in a rural New Zealand adolescent population: 1975-89.A survey of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP symptoms and spirometry in 435 adolescent schoolchildren was undertaken in 1989 in a rural, largely Maori population. The survey questionnaires were identical to those used in a 1975 survey at the same school. The prevalence of reported Asthma_ASDPTO_HP or wheeze significantly increased from 26.2% to 34.0%. This increase occurred in groups reporting Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, and also those reporting wheeze unassociated with colds, but without a previous Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. There was a tendency for a rise in reported wheeze in Europeans (24.3% to 27.4%) and a significant rise in Maoris (27.1% to 36.2%). The reclassification of other respiratory problems did not account for the increase. Data from this study provides evidence that there has been a rise in the prevalence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in this New Zealand population over a time period of 14 years.

Long term outcome of ventilated asthmatics.Over a 25 year period, 31 asthmatic children received artificial ventilation for Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP at Alder Hey Children's Hospital on 48 occasions. Altogether 47 episodes occurred from 1971-89, with no decline in the number of episodes per year (mean 2.5) over this period. Eight children died during Recurrent_HP positive pressure ventilation (IPPV), and of the 23 survivors, three further children had subsequently died from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Seventeen children were followed up for more than a year after IPPV. Sixteen still had symptoms of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and over half had symptoms every day. Ten cooperated with pulmonary function tests: mean forced expiratory volume in one second was 83% of predicted and geometric mean provocative histamine concentration (PC20) was 2.1 mg/ml. Since the follow up study a fourth patient had died from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. IPPV continues to be required for a small number of asthmatic children each year. The survivors remain a high risk group with significant continuing morbidity and mortality.

Exposure to hydrogen sulphide and respiratory function.A study was carried out to assess possible effects of low concentrations of hydrogen sulphide on respiratory function. The cohort comprised 26 male pulp mill workers (mean age 40.3, range 22-60 years) with a daily exposure to hydrogen sulphide in the workplace, and 10 volunteers, who had Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (three men, mean age 40.7, range 33 to 50 years, and seven women, mean age 44.1, range 31 to 61 years). The respiratory function of the pulp mill workers was monitored by measuring forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and bronchial responsiveness after at least one day off work and at the end of a workday. Bronchial responsiveness was tested by challenge with histamine. The 10 asthmatic subjects were exposed in laboratory conditions to 2 ppm of hydrogen sulphide for 30 minutes in an exposure chamber. Airway resistance (Raw) and specific airway conductance (SGaw) were assessed by a body plethysmograph, and the ventilatory capacities were measured with a flow volume spirometer. No significant changes in respiratory function or bronchial responsiveness related to exposure to hydrogen sulphide in the pulp mill workers were found. In the asthmatic subjects, Raw was increased by 26.3% and SGaw was decreased by 8.4% on average after exposure to hydrogen sulphide. These changes were not statistically significant. In two subjects, however, changes were greater than 30% in both Raw and SGaw, indicating bronchial obstruction. It is concluded that exposure for a relatively short time to hydrogen sulphide concentrations appreciably higher than those existing in ambient air do not cause noticeable effects on respiratory function.

Adverse effects of inhaled corticosteroids.Corticosteroids have a significant role in the management of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP due to their powerful anti-inflammatory actions. However, when given orally, they cause significant and unwanted side-effects. Early attempts to circumvent these side-effects were largely unsuccessful. Recently, new synthetic corticosteroids have been developed that have powerful topical action but weak Generalized_HP effects due to rapid systemic metabolism. These new compounds provide adequate control of airways' obstruction in almost all asthmatics. Oral candidiasis may occur but can generally be controlled by adjusting the Frequency_HP of dosage and changing delivery systems. In high doses, there is biochemical evidence of adrenal suppression, but the clinical importance of this is not yet clear and there is no evidence of a significant effect on growth in children. High dose inhaled corticosteroids have been shown to Affect_ASDPTO biochemical indices of bone turnover in the short term. The long term clinical consequences of this are still under evaluation. Inhaled corticosteroids have provided a significant advance in the management of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, but physicians need to remain alert for the possibility of systemic side effects when used in high doses for long periods of time.

[Chronicle of an announced death: the end of intrinsic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].The word "intrinsic" Asthma_ASDPTO_HP which is not usually quoted by French authors should be eliminated from the medical vocabulary. Similar past history, clinical symptoms, house or occupational exposure are found in all varieties of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Histological features are the same in atopic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Late_Onset_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, apparently non allergic. On immunologic point of view there are two types of IgE receptors type I on mastocytes, type II on inflammatory cells, with immunomodulation by IL4 and T lymphocytes. On the other hand, atopic status is an autosomic dominant inherited trait, with a gene locus on the chromosome 11 Q and may be transferred with bone marrow cells graft. Finally Asthma_ASDPTO_HP appears to be a local variety of IgE hyperresponsiveness to environmental factors. These basic notions have practical consequences and legal aspects.

Changes in asthmatic patients' symptoms and lifestyles on institution of inhaled budesonide therapy.An open, multi-centre, general practice study was carried out in 1661 asthmatic patients to assess the efficacy, in terms of symptom relief and changes in lifestyle, of budesonide and to record objective lung function changes and any adverse events. After a 1-week run-in period on any pre-trial anti-Asthma_ASDPTO_HP medication, patients received either 200 micrograms or 400 micrograms budesonide twice daily by metered dose inhaler for 4 weeks. Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) was measured by the doctor on entry, after the run-in, and at the end of the study and patients were asked to complete diary cards on a daily basis to record compliance, bronchodilator usage and the Severity_HP of Cough_HP, wheeze and Sleep_disturbance_HP, and weekly to record 5 lifestyle assessments, e.g. physical activity. Analysis of data from the clinic visits and 1375 completed diary cards showed that PEFR increased significantly from 321 +/- 3 l/min at the end of the run-in to 368 +/- 3 l/min at the end of the trial; 77% of patients had an improved PEFR. Bronchodilator use decreased significantly from 4.2 +/- 0.1 times/day during the run-in period to 3.0 +/- 0.1 times/day at the end of the study; 65% of patients used less bronchodilator. Significant improvements were recorded in all the symptoms and lifestyle indices monitored; 76% of patients improved in at least 5 of the 11 assessments. Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 103 (6%) of patients: none was classified as serious or unexpected. No sub-group of patients was identified in which the results were at variance from the full sample. It is concluded that budesonide improves patients' lifestyle and ability to carry out normal activities, as well as improving PEFR and reducing bronchodilator use, in Mild_HP to moderately Severe_HP asthmatics treated in general practice.

[The role of eosinophils, neutrophils and lymphocytes for the development of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in a guinea pig model of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].To elucidate the role of eosinophils, neutrophils and lymphocytes for the development of bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) following antigen exposure, we have developed a guinea pig model of BHR. Guinea pigs immunized by repeated exposure to aerosolized ovalbumin (OA) were intravenously given metopirone, a cortisol synthesis inhibitor, 24 hrs before and 30 min before antigen challenge, and to prevent death from immediate Severe_HP bronchoconstriction, chlorpheniramine maleate was also injected. After antigen challenge with high dose of OA, LAR occurred in twelve of fifteen animals (80%) and the bronchial responsiveness to acetylcholine (Ach) was significantly increased. Histologic examination at 72 h showed a significant increase in the number of eosinophils but not neutrophils within the tracheal walls. However, there was no significant correlation between the change in bronchial responsiveness to Ach at 24 h and the number of eosinophil in the tracheal wall at 72 h. When guinea pigs were treated with Cyclosporin A or FK506, T-lymphocyte selective immunosuppressive agents, from the beginning of immunization period, both eosinophil infiltration and an increase in bronchial responsiveness were inhibited. These results suggest that eosinophils and T-lymphocytes may play an important role in the development of bronchial hyperresponsiveness.

[CA 19-9 in patients with benign pulmonary diseases].Although serum CA 19-9 is considered to be a useful and specific Neoplasm_HP marker for pancreatic Neoplasm_HP, some patients with benign pulmonary diseases show elevated serum CA 19-9 levels. We measured serum CA 19-9 levels of 156 patients with benign pulmonary diseases (55 with asbestosis, 11 with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, 32 with Bronchiectasis_HP, 16 with idiopathic Pulmonary_fibrosis_HP (IPF), 13 with healed Pulmonary_tuberculosis_HP (HPT) and 29 other benign diseases). The percentage of patients with positive serum CA 19-9 was 42.3% (14.5% in asbestosis, 27.3% in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, 59.4% in Bronchiectasis_HP, 81.3% in IPF, 61.5% in HPT and 51.7% in others). In some patients, serum CA 19-9 levels were as high as those found in malignant Gastrointestinal_Diseases_ASDPTO. Serum CA 19-9 levels correlated well with disease activity. Immunohistochemically, CA 19-9 was expressed in mucous cells of the bronchial gland and surface of the bronchiolar surface epithelium cells in benign pulmonary disease. Gel filtration study suggested some difference in molecular weight between the serum CA 19-9 antigen of lung Neoplasm_HP and that of benign pulmonary diseases. It is suggested that serum CA 19-9 increases in the case of hyperplasia of the bronchiolar epithelium cells or the mucous cells of the bronchial gland. We conclude that benign pulmonary disease is one of the factors that Affect_ASDPTO serum CA 19-9 levels.

[Bronchoconstriction in isocapnic Hyperventilation_HP-induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].It is well known that some asthmatic patients develop bronchoconstriction after exercise challenge (exercise-induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, EIA). Recently, it has been pointed out that isocapnic Hyperventilation_HP also induces similar bronchoconstriction (Hyperventilation_HP-induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, HIA) in the same asthmatic subjects. However, the mechanism of HIA has not yet been determined. In the present study, we performed exercise and Hyperventilation_HP challenge in the same patients and pulmonary function data and neutrophil chemotactic factor (NCF) in Peripheral_HP blood were examined before and after both challenges. Twelve asthmatic patients with normal pulmonary function data on testing days were subjected to exercise test on a bicycle ergometer and then isocapnic Hyperventilation_HP tests in subsequent days. Subjects breathed dry air from the cylinder. Isocapnic Hyperventilation_HP was performed by monitoring minute ventilation and each patient followed the same minute ventilation exercise. The reduction of FEV1.0 and time course of airway obstruction were almost the same after exercise and Hyperventilation_HP testing. All patients who developed EIA also developed HIA and other patients did not develop both EIA and HIA. Changes of Rrs, V50 and V25 and their time course after each test were also similar in EIA(+) and HIA(+), and in EIA(-) and HIA(-). NCF increased significantly after both challenges in EIA(+) and HIA(+) patient, although increment of NCF was much less these the increases of HIA(+). These data may suggest that the development of bronchoconstriction was compatible after exercise and Hyperventilation_HP in each asthmatic patient, however, the mechanism of HIA may differ from EIA, although NCF slightly but significantly increased in HIA, suggesting the possible role of a chemical mediator.

These data may suggest that the development of bronchoconstriction was compatible after exercise and hyperventilation in each asthmatic patient, however, the mechanism of HIA may differ from EIA, although NCF slightly but significantly increased in HIA, suggesting the possible role of a chemical mediator.
[Pulmonary infiltration with Eosinophilia_HP possibly induced by cefotiam in a case of steroid-dependent Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].A 37-year-old female with Refractory_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP taking betamethasone orally (1 mg/d), showed a Fever_HP of 38.5 degrees C, Productive_Cough_HP and Dyspnea_HP. The chest X-ray demonstrated Diffuse_HP infiltration in the Left_HP lower lung field. The WBC count was 16,000/mm3 with 6% eosinophils. She was treated with intravenous drip infusion of antibiotics (Cefotiam 2 mg/d and Sisomicin 150 mg/d) for 2 weeks, and her symptoms and the chest X-ray findings improved. However, at the end of the therapy Eosinophilia_HP was noticed. Sixteen days after the completion of antibiotic therapy, she again experienced Fever_HP, Cough_HP and Dyspnea_HP. The chest X-ray again demonstrated Diffuse_HP infiltrations in the Left_HP lower lung field. The total IgE level, histamine and circulating immune complex titers were elevated. The WBC count was 14,700/mm3 with 34% eosinophils. Although a sputum culture yielded no organisms, many eosinophils were observed in the sputum. There were no clinical or laboratory findings compatible with allergic broncho-pulmonary aspergillosis. After the administration of oral prednisolone (40 mg/d), the patient showed rapid improvement with resolution of all symptoms and normalization of the IgE, histamine and circulating immune complex levels. The chest X-ray revealed marked regression of the pulmonary infiltrations. A microscopic examination of a transbronchial biopsy specimen demonstrated Moderate_HP eosinophilic infiltrations. It was compatible with the Diagnosis_ASDPTO of pulmonary infiltration with Eosinophilia_HP. Treatment was performed with prednisolone. The result of a lymphocyte stimulation test was positive for Cefotiam. An in vitro test was performed to evaluate the Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Drug_Allergy_HP in this case.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

[Pump function of the Left_HP ventricle during the stages of Cor_pulmonale_HP development].Cluster analysis was used to examine the nature and magnitude of changes in Left_HP ventricular pump function in relation to the Severity_HP of primary bronchial obstruction in patients with non-atopic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (n = 45) and Chronic_HP obstructive Bronchitis_HP (n = 45). In the patients with Obstructive_lung_disease_HP, Central_HP hemodynamic changes were found to be determined by the bronchial patency and independent of the pathogenesis of the obstruction. During a remission there was a significant reduction in total Peripheral_HP resistance as compared to the values seen in Healthy_HP subjects, whereas in Moderate_HP or Severe_HP obstruction there was a marked increase in total Peripheral_HP resistance and a decrease in Stroke_HP volume and cardiac output. A drastic bronchial obstruction was followed not only by Central_HP hemodynamic changes, but a fall in ejection fraction and a rise in Left_HP ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes.

Nasal_polyposis_HP as a risk factor for Hypertension_HP.Arterial Hypertension_HP was found in 78 of 224 consecutive patients operated for Nasal_polyposis_HP. An exacerbated degree of Hypertension_HP was significant in groups aged above 50 years. In total, 46% of patients whose Nasal_polyposis_HP was of a duration of more than 10 years suffered from Hypertension_HP. Fifty of 78 patients developed Hypertension_HP after Nasal_polyposis_HP was established and the mean duration time from polyposis to Hypertension_HP was 11.1 years. Hypertension_HP was established in 50% of patients suffering from the triad Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, intolerance to acetylsalicylic acid and Nasal_polyposis_HP. In analogy with knowledge that Sleep_apnea_HP and Snoring_HP are aetiological factors for arterial Hypertension_HP, we propose that long-standing Nasal_obstruction_HP by Nasal_polyposis_HP be a risk factor for arterial Hypertension_HP.

[Diagnostic and prognostic significance of studying histocompatibility antigens in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].As a result of a comprehensive clinical and functional examination of 217 patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, including study of HLA-antigen composition of their tissues, a relationship between B13, B21 and B35 antigen carriers and susceptibility to Asthma_ASDPTO_HP as well as associations with the form of the disease, its Severity_HP and some features of its course were found. Clinical examples confirming these arguments are illustrated. Possibilities of individual prognosis at a clinic are grounded.

Effects of hydrocortisone and aminophylline on plasma leukotriene C4 levels in patients during an asthmatic attack.To study the role of leukotriene C4(LTC4) and the effect of hydrocortisone and aminophylline on plasma LTC4 levels in patients with asthmatic attacks, we measured LTC4 in plasma of 18 asthmatics during a Wheezing_HP attack and of 7 normal subjects. Blood samples were obtained before and after treatment with aminophylline and/or hydrocortisone injections. We extracted LTC4 using a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge for the measurement of LTC4 by radioimmunoassay. The plasma levels of immunoreactive LTC4 (i-LTC4) of the normal subjects were 142 +/- 25 pg/ml (n = 7), while those of nonatopic type asthmatic patients with Wheezing_HP attacks were 208 +/- 68 pg/ml (n = 15) (p less than 0.01). Before and after treatment with both hydrocortisone succinate (100 mg) and aminophylline (250 mg), 6 asthmatic patients with Wheezing_HP attacks had a mean plasma level of i-LTC4 181 +/- 24 and 132 +/- 18 pg/ml (p less than 0.01), respectively. On the other hand, the treatment with aminophylline 250 mg alone increased the i-LTC4 levels from 178 +/- 19 pg/mg to 213 +/- 16 pg/mg (n = 6)(p less than 0.05), while treatment with hydrocortisone succinate 100 mg decreased the i-LTC4 level 0.05 from 284 +/- 99 pg/ml to 249 +/- 85 pg/ml (n = 4)(p less than 0.05). In conclusion, the present study shows that the i-LTC4 level in venous blood of patients with asthmatic attacks is decreased significantly by treatment with hydrocortisone succinate.

Rising Asthma_ASDPTO_HP mortality in young males in Hong Kong, 1976-85.The trend in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP mortality in Hong Kong was estimated from published statistics for the years 1976-85. To avoid coding errors in death certifications, only Asthma_ASDPTO_HP deaths in the age group 5-34 years were analysed. Mortality rose annually by an average of 10.5% in male (P less than 0.02), but not female asthmatics. Such an increase was not due to a change in coding as a result of the revision of the International Classification of Diseases in 1979, or an exchange of diagnostic labelling from other respiratory diseases. The exact causes for the increase in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP mortality have yet to be determined.

[Mechanism of the antiAsthma_ASDPTO_HPtic effect of total coumarins in the fruit of Cnidium monnieri (L.)Cuss].Total coumarins in the fruit of Cnidium monnieri show a marked protective effect against Asthma_ASDPTO_HP induced by inhalation of histamine in conscious guinea pig. In vitro these total coumarins can relax the contraction of the isolated trachea in guinea pigs induced by histamine as well as increase the perfusion rate of isolated lung preparation of guinea pig. These actions, however, may be blocked by propranolol. Besides, these coumarins cannot increase the heart rate and arterial blood pressure in anesthetized rats. All this shows that the antiAsthma_ASDPTO_HPtic effect of total coumarins in the fruit of Cnidium monnieri is mediated by beta 2-receptor.

Effects of chest physical therapy on lung function in children recovering from Status_asthmaticus_HP.The effects of chest physical therapy in Status_asthmaticus_HP in children have been studied in 38 children aged 6 to 13 years in a randomized placebo controlled trial. The study began between 6 and 24 hours after admission to hospital; 19 children received chest physical therapy (PT) and 19 children received placebo visits. Each child had 4 treatments over 2 days which were preceded by nebulized salbutamol. Lung volumes and flow rates were measured in a body plethysmograph before salbutamol and before and after either PT or placebo on the first and fourth treatments. Throughout the study standard Asthma_ASDPTO_HP drug therapy was given. In both groups characteristics such as sex, race, age, height, weight, Severity_HP, and baseline lung function were similar. Taking into account the baseline, lung function at the end of the study was similar in both groups. Three 12 year old children in the PT group showed improvements in flows above those seen in any children in the placebo group. We conclude that chest PT, when combined with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP drug therapy, does not improve lung function in most children in this age group with Status_asthmaticus_HP.

Aerosolized budesonide in asthmatic infants: a double blind study.The efficacy of nebulized budesonide (0.5 mg b.i.d.) against placebo was evaluated in the management of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in 23 infants, aged 3 to 17 months, using a double blind crossover design. After an initial treatment period of 2 weeks placebo and budesonide were randomly administered during two consecutive treatment periods of 1 month. The progress of the patients was monitored using diary score cards, the number of salbutamol doses needed during the treatment periods, clinical examinations using standardized scoring cards, and registration of parents' preference period. Although there was a tendency toward fewer Wheezing_HP periods during budesonide, the results of the diary score cards were not significantly different between the budesonide period and the placebo period. The number of salbutamol doses used was also the same during both periods. Clinical examination after budesonide revealed less Rhinitis_HP and a less pathological lung auscultation, but the difference between the two periods was also not significant. Furthermore, the parents' preference could not distinguish between budesonide and placebo. We conclude that the trends in favor of nebulized budesonide are not significant and do not suggest that the suspension is effective in Severe_HP infantile Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

[Results of hardening in children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].In 40 girls between 10 and 16 years, 28 of them Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics, spirometry and body plethysmography was carried out before and after an air bath from the end of december at outside temperatures of -10 degrees C up to april at temperatures of +10 degrees C. In 50% of the Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic girls a Bronchospasm_HP occurred, which depended nearly linearly (r = 0.68) from the outside temperature. After the usual air bath at the beach in bathing suits in three quarters of these girls a regression of the Bronchospasm_HP nearly or completely to the initial values was observed. This change is interpreted as a sympathicotonic stimulation by the cutaneous system with Bronchospasm_HPolytic effect.

[The effect of the Finnish dry sauna on Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in childhood].More than 400,000 sauna baths have been built in Germany. Frequently, children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and their parents raise the question whether sauna bathing might be hazardous for the lungs. In present study the effects of sauna bathing on the ventilation have been evaluated by use of peak-flow meters. Only one 12-years old girl suffered an attack of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP while using a cold shower, probably as a result of breathing cold air. No other complications have been observed. Sauna bathing can be recommended for children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, since advantages in the resistance against infections and in psychosocial development can be expected.

[Sensitivity and specificity of multi-Frequency_HP oscillation methods, body plethysmography and spirometry in 5-8-year-old asthmatic patients].We compared specificity and sensitivity of the forced oscillation technique with the standard methods of body plethysmography and spirometry in children suffering from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (age 5-8 yrs). We investigated 60 Healthy_HP and 66 asthmatic children by forced oscillation, plethysmography and spirometry. Mean FEV1% pred was 99.7 and 82.4% in the Healthy_HP and asthmatic subjects, respectively, and mean SRaw was 0.68 and 1.18 kPa*s, respectively. Forced oscillation and plethysmography could be measured in all children, whereas 29% of the investigated children failed to perform valid spirometry. Discriminant analysis was used to compare the optimal classification which could be obtained from the measured data with the clinical one. Fixing specificity to 95%, we computed sensitivities of 66% (forced oscillation), 68% (body plethysmography), and 76% (spirometry). We conclude that the diagnostic value of the three methods in young children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is similar. However, the value of spirometry is limited by cooperation in these young children.

[Beyond normal values--practical experiences with the standard deviation score (SDS) for the assessment of lung function measurements in Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].Expressing results of pulmonary function tests as a percentage of the subject's predicted value (% predicted) has been widely adopted. This method has some serious disadvantages: The range of values % predicted in the reference population depends on the body height and varies from index to index. An alternative is to use the standard deviation score (SDS), which is derived by dividing the difference between the recorded and predicted value by the standard deviation of the residuals (SDS = (recorded-predicted)/SD).

[Pulmonary transfer factor for carbon monoxide (TLco) in Healthy_HP children and in children with Chronic_HP Abnormal_lung_morphology_HPs, measured with an improved rebreathing technique].TLco, FRC-He and IVC were tested in 86 subjects (5-29 years). 46 children were Healthy_HP, 21 patients had cystic fibrosis, 13 Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and 6 allergic alveolitis. The test gas included 14% helium and 0.3% CO. The wash in time was 18 s, the measuring time 20 s. All children were measured at rest and in a sitting Position_HP. The rebreathing volume was 3/4 of the VC plus 300 ml additional volume. The results showed a good reproducibility. The TLco increases with age, height, weight and body surface area, the correlation with VC, FRC and TLC was better. A differentiation between Healthy_HP children and patients suffering from Abnormal_lung_morphology_HP is possible. The clearest results were shown in the case of patients suffering from CF.

The effect of fresh orange juice on bronchial hyperreactivity in asthmatic subjects.We studied 16 Mild_HP Stable_HP asthmatic subjects to determine if orange juice increases nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivity (NSBH). In 9 subjects, bronchial responsiveness to histamine was assessed before and after water ingestion on the control day, and orange ingestion on a consecutive day. The mean (+/- SD) ratio of log10 PD20 FEV1 after water: log10 PD20 FEV1 before water (1.00 +/- 0.13) was not significantly different from the mean (+/- SD) ratio of log10 PD20 FEV1 after orange: log10 PD20 FEV1 before orange (0.97 +/- 0.12). To avoid the possibility of histamine tachyphylaxis, 7 subjects participated in a second protocol in which histamine PD20 FEV1 was determined on a control day (geometric mean 0.11 mg.) and again two days later, thirty minutes after ingestion of orange juice (geometric mean 0.06 mg). There was no significant difference in the PD20 FEV1 (p = 0.344). Our data show that ingestion of fresh orange juice per se did not heighten NSBH in our subjects. (PD20 FEV1 is the dose of histamine required to produce a twenty percent fall in forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1]).

The mean (+/- SD) ratio of log10 PD20 FEV1 after water: log10 PD20 FEV1 before water (1.00 +/- 0.13) was not significantly different from the mean (+/- SD) ratio of log10 PD20 FEV1 after orange: log10 PD20 FEV1 before orange (0.97 +/- 0.12). To avoid the possibility of histamine tachyphylaxis, 7 subjects participated in a second protocol in which histamine PD20 FEV1 was determined on a control day (geometric mean 0.11 mg.) and again two days later, thirty minutes after ingestion of orange juice (geometric mean 0.06 mg). There was no significant difference in the PD20 FEV1 (p = 0.344). Our data show that ingestion of fresh orange juice per se did not heighten NSBH in our subjects. (PD20 FEV1 is the dose of histamine required to produce a twenty percent fall in forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1]).
Perception of breathlessness during bronchoconstriction induced by antigen, exercise, and histamine challenges.Perception of breathlessness was studied in eight patients with Mild_HP, Stable_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP after a histamine and exercise challenge performed before and 24 and 48 hours respectively after an antigen challenge. FEV1 and perception of breathlessness, evaluated by Borg's 10 point category scale, were measured after each administration of doubling antigen or histamine concentrations to achieve a greater than 20% fall in FEV1, and after six minutes of steady state exercise at 80% of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max). The geometric mean provocative concentration of histamine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20) fell from 1.67 mg/ml before antigen challenge to 0.52 mg/ml 24 hours after the challenge. The median maximal % fall in FEV1 with exercise was 24.9% (range 10.5-40.5%) before and 30.6% (range 13.8-52.3%) 48 hours after antigen challenge. The median maximum % fall in FEV1 after antigen inhalation was 20.1% (range 13.3-35.2%) within the first hour; only two subjects had a late fall in FEV1 (23% and 58%). The median (range) of Borg scores obtained when FEV1 was reduced by 20% did not differ significantly for the three types of Acute_HP challenges: 1.25 (0.5-2.5) and 1.0 (0.5-3.0) after histamine tests, 1.0 (0.5-4.1) and 1.55 (0.5-2.0) after exercise, and 1.5 (0-3.0) after antigen challenge. In the two subjects who had a late response to antigen the Borg score was reduced for the same % fall in FEV1 as with the early response. It is concluded that the perception of breathlessness does not differ appreciably during the early response to histamine, antigen exposure, or exercise, but that it is reduced during the late asthmatic response. It was not influenced by previous antigen exposure, despite an increase in airway responsiveness.

Analysis of bronchial reactivity in epidemiological studies.The measurement of bronchial reactivity in epidemiological studies has the advantage of quantifying an objective physiological feature of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Bronchial reactivity was developed in a clinical setting and has been conventionally expressed as the dose of agonist producing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PD20). As PD20 can be estimated for less than 20% of subjects in general community surveys with the doses of agonist that are usually given, data from most subjects must be censored. Thus PD20 alone is a poor index of bronchial reactivity for epidemiological studies. Data from 809 aluminium smelter workers were used to evaluate alternative methods of analysing bronchial reactivity. Dose-response relationships were analysed by four methods: (1) PD20 by the conventional method of interpolating the dose on a logarithmic scale between the last two measurements of FEV1; (2) PD20 (with allowance for extrapolation), estimated by fitting an exponential curve to the dose-response data; (3) the linear regression slope between dose and FEV1 when significant; (4) the dose-response slope obtained in all subjects as the % change in FEV1 from baseline in response to total dose. When each of these measures was related to symptoms, Diagnosis_ASDPTO, and treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, all differentiated between "asthmatic" and "non-asthmatic" subjects. The dose-response slope (method 4) had the advantages of simplicity and no censored data, and was shown to be clinically relevant. It is suggested that the dose-response slope should be used for the analysis of bronchial reactivity in epidemiological studies.

Lung function 8-18 years after Recurrent_HP positive pressure ventilation for hyaline membrane disease.Lung function and respiratory symptoms were studied in 40 children aged 8-18 years who had been ventilated for hyaline membrane disease after birth; 11 had had bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Also studied were 38 age matched children who had had hyaline membrane disease but had not required ventilation, 25 unmatched children who were born prematurely but did not develop hyaline membrane disease, and 39 randomly selected pupils of similar age. There was no difference in thoracic gas volume, total lung capacity, inspiratory vital capacity, residual volume, or transfer factor for carbon monoxide between the groups. Respiratory symptoms during the three years before the study and the Frequency_HP of clinically diagnosed Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in patients and their family were similar in all the children with hyaline membrane disease irrespective of whether they had been ventilated or had had bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, however, had a lower forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) before bronchodilator (73% predicted) than the other groups (88-95% predicted). Children who had required ventilation had lower values for specific airways conductance (sGaw) and a greater increase in FEV1 (delta FEV1) after salbutamol (13%) than non-ventilated children (6%); delta FEV1 was associated with the peak pressure of Recurrent_HP positive pressure ventilation, a Family_history_HP of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and a history of Wheezing_HP, Recurrent_HP respiratory illnesses, and a doctor's Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP during the three years before the study. These findings indicate that after eight years of age patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia have more reversible airways obstruction, compatible with increased bronchial smooth muscle tone.

[The therapeutic effect of somofilin in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP patients].The sustained release theophylline drug Somophylline in capsules was applied in 21 Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients (12 women and 9 men), mean age 44.5 years in the course of 14 days in hospital conditions. The dose of the drug was 9-10 mg/kg body mass (24 h given in two equal doses in 12 h intervals). The effect was favourable in 17 patients (80.95%), weak--in 2 patients (9.52%) and no effect in 2 patients (9.52%). Somophylline is very well tolerated. The blood level remains in the therapeutic ranges during the treatment (about 10 micrograms/ml).

[Allergy_HP and bronchial hyperreactivity in Chronic_HP Obstructive_lung_disease_HP].In 630 patients with various forms of Chronic_HP obstructive pulmonary disease (Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP) an attempt was made to determine the nature of bronchial reactivity and to find out the participation of Allergy_HP in the pathogenesis of the disease with the help of clinical observations, skin-allergic test and inhalatory bronchial provocation test (specific and nonspecific). Clinical manifestations of hypersensitivity were found in a great number of patients (320). All of them were with nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivity and most of them were with specific skin hyperreactivity (75%) and with specific bronchial hyperreactivity (67.2%). These data show that Allergy_HP and bronchial hyperreactivity take part in the pathogenesis of Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP. The tests for Allergy_HP and bronchial hyperreactivity should find place in the diagnostic scheme for Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP.

[An epidemiological study of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in the Stara Zagora District].A cohort of 284 persons is included in the epidemiologic study of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP 105 men (36.97%) and 179 women (63.03%), mean age 47 +/- 13 years. The study includes a three-year period (1986-1983). A total of 23 indices are taken into consideration, 12 of which are social and 11 are medico-biological. A greater influence of the social factor "place of work" than that of the factor "residence" is established. The high percentage of persons on a disablement pension (27.72%), concerning mainly persons in active age, raises several problems which should be solved in the region in prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects. The highest percentage of the patients are with Moderate_HP and Severe_HP form of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP--82.04% (233) with Frequent_HP attacks and 76.06% (216) are with Respiratory_failure_HP. The index of glucocorticoid dependence (in percentage) leads to the conclusion of inefficient diagnostic and therapeutic approach to the disease in the district of Stara Zagora.

[The use of autogenic training in the combined therapy of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP patients].Since 1976 in the Allergologic Clinic autogenous training is applied in Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients as group therapy combined with respiratory exercises. In 10 Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients in the conditions of an Acute_HP experiment the forced vital capacity, forced expiratory flow for I s and maximum mean expiratory flow were followed up after autogenous training. An improvement of the ventilation indices was found. The autogenous training is a suitable nonmedicamentous method as a part of the total rehabilitation therapy in Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients.

[The use of the preparation defedrin in the therapy of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP patients].The therapeutic efficacy of the Soviet drug Dephedrin was tried in patients with Mild_HP and Moderate_HP form of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The drug was administered in a dose of 0.03 g 3 times daily for a period of 15 days. Out of 10 patients with Mild_HP form of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in patients the effect was very good, in 5 patients it was good and in patient it was poor. Out of 10 patients with Moderate_HP form of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in 3 patients the effect was very good, in 3 patients it was good and in 4 patients--poor. The ventilation indices improved but without reacting statistical significance. The conclusion is that Dephedrin is suitable for the Mild_HP form of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

[Pharmacological studies on dingchuanning].Dingchuanning has been found to increase markedly the perfusion of isolated lung of guinea-pig. It may produce a relaxing effect on the smooth muscles of the isolated trachea, bronchus and lung strips of guinea-pigs, as well as a prominent protective effect on the Asthma_ASDPTO_HP induced by inhalation of bronchoconstrictors in conscious guinea-pigs. It also has significant expectorant and antianaphylactic effects and helps to inhibit markedly the SRS-A release from lung tissues and to counteract directly the activity of SRS-A.

An audit of inhaler technique among Asthma_ASDPTO_HP patients of 34 general practitioners.Doctors from 34 practices participated in an audit study which examined inhaler technique in up to 20 of their patients. A new scoring system, applicable to all forms of device, was used. Although the majority of the 422 patients (63%) was using metered dose inhalers, a broad range of other devices was included; most frequently Rotahalers (15%) and spacer devices (9%). For analysis, technique scores were rated as 'good' (score 4 out of 4), 'adequate' (score 3 or 4) and 'inadequate' (score 2 or less). Overall, 25% of patients had inadequate technique. Of all devices, the Turbohaler had the highest proportion of patients with good technique (78%), and metered dose inhalers the lowest (45%). This audit confirms that technique is unsatisfactory for a significant proportion of patients, regardless of the device used. A simple scoring system promotes consistent testing of technique within a practice.

Why asthmatic patients should not sleep in the Right_HP Lateral_HP decubitus Position_HP.The topographical points Affect_ASDPTOing nasal resistance include the shoulders, upper thorax and buttocks, and we have demonstrated that vagal tone increases with Right_HP-sided pressure and decreases with Left_HP. We would therefore strongly recommend that asthmatic patients should avoid sleeping in the Right_HP Lateral_HP decubitus Position_HP. It would be interesting to speculate on a number of ramifications ensuing from the presence of increased vagal tone in asthmatic patients. If present, atrophic Rhinitis_HP, Nasal_polyposis_HP, and septal deviation may possibly Affect_ASDPTO incidence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP depending upon its presentation in the Left_HP or Right_HP nasal turbinate. We suggest that there should be increased incidence of Right_HP septal deviation and increased incidence of Right_HP turbinate Nasal_polyposis_HP in patients presenting with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP may possibly have certain nasal cycle patterns that could easily be measured using Podoshin plates. Finally, our animal model of forced uniLateral_HP nostril breathing may explain certain facets of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

The effect of peptidase inhibitors on bradykinin-induced bronchoconstriction in guinea-pigs in vivo.1. Bradykinin (BK) instilled directly into the airway lumen caused bronchoconstriction in anaesthetized, mechanically ventilated guinea-pigs in the presence of propranolol (1 mg kg-1 i.v.). The geometric mean dose of BK required to produce 100% increase in airway opening pressure (PD100) was 22.9 nmol (95% c.i. 11.7-44.6 nmol). 2. The dose-response curve for the effect of instilled BK was significantly shifted to the Left_HP by the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril (5 and 50 nmol instillation, PD100 = 3.0, 95% c.i. 0.98-8.9, and 2.0 nmol, 95% c.i. 0.65-6.2 nmol, respectively). 3. The neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitor, phosphoramidon (5 and 50 nmol instillation) also shifted the dose-response curve for the effect of instilled BK; the PD100 values = 2.2 (95% c.i. 0.40-11.7) and 1.8 nmol (95% c.i. 0.87-3.5 nmol), respectively. 4. After pretreatment with captopril (50 nmol) and phosphoramidon (50 nmol) in combination, the dose-response curve for the effect of instilled BK (PD100 = 1.1 nmol, 95% c.i. 0.37-3.2 nmol) was similar to that obtained in the presence of each inhibitor used alone. 5. The kinase I inhibitor, DL-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethylthiopropionic acid (50 nmol instillation) failed to alter the dose-response curve to instilled BK (PD100 = 14.6 nmol, 95% c.i. 6.7-32.0 nmol). 6. These data suggest that both ACE and NEP degrade BK in the airway lumen, but that kininase I is not involved.

[Contents of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha and thromboxane B2 in the blood of patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].There is a relationship between Severity_HP of bacterial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP clinical symptoms and plasma 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, TxB2: in Moderate_HP disease against grave one as well as in clinical versus subclinical forms (remission) relevant indices are reduced. On the one hand elevated content of blood 6-keto-PGF1 alpha seems compensatory rising in response to TxB2 bronchoconstriction. On the other hand, it impairs microcirculation and enhances mediators of inflammation, promotes exudation and Edema_HP of bronchoalveolar mucosa, thus contributing to obstruction.
[Contents of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha and thromboxane B2 in the blood of patients with bronchial asthma].There is a relationship between severity of bacterial bronchial asthma clinical symptoms and plasma 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, TxB2: in moderate disease against grave one as well as in clinical versus subclinical forms (remission) relevant indices are reduced. On the one hand elevated content of blood 6-keto-PGF1 alpha seems compensatory rising in response to TxB2 bronchoconstriction. On the other hand, it impairs microcirculation and enhances mediators of inflammation, promotes exudation and edema of bronchoalveolar mucosa, thus contributing to obstruction.
[Glucocorticoid receptors in Peripheral_HP blood lymphocytes of patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].Quantitation of glucocorticoid receptors (GCR) and the study of their affinity for glucocorticosteroids (GCS) were made in Peripheral_HP blood lymphocytes of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (BA) patients in consideration of GCR treatment and serum levels of endogenous cortisol. It is stated that GCR of Healthy_HP controls and GCS-untreated patients outnumbered those of cortisol-dependent BA patients on hormone therapy. Following discontinuation of glucocorticoid drugs GCR count in cortisol-dependent BA tends to rise. Endogenous cortisol has no effect on GCR level estimated by 3H-triamcinolone acetonide.

[Effects of magnesium sulfate aerosol on indices of external respiration in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].Plethysmography and pneumotachography were applied to measure bronchial permeability, and reactivity of the bronchi in 10 patients with pre-Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and 17 with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP upon administration of magnesium sulfate aerosol (solution osmolality 260 mmol/l, pH-6.6). Though the drug inhalation did not induce bronchial Dilatation_HP, it diminished both hypersensitivity and hyperreactivity of the bronchial tree to acetylcholine. These properties of magnesium sulfate in the absence of unwanted sequelae when introduced endobronchially allow its advocating in combined treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and pre-Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

[Nebulizing terbutaline therapy in children with Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].To evaluate the therapeutic effect of nebulized terbutaline in children with Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, 21 children, aged 1 year and 7 months to 10 years, with Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, were enrolled into this study, during the period from July to December 1989. Each patient received nebulized terbutaline (Bricanyl) 5 mg/dose over 10 minutes. The respiratory rate, pulse rate, blood pressure, peak expiratory flow rate and clinical Severity_HP score were recorded before, and at 10 minutes after treatment. Comparing with the data before treatment, respiratory rate, peak expiratory flow rate and clinical Severity_HP score at 10 minutes after treatment showed significant improvement (p value less than 0.05; less than 0.0005; less than 0.0001, respectively), but pulse rate and blood pressure did not differ significantly. It was concluded that administration of nebulized terbutaline, at a dose of 5 mg, was both safe and effective in treating Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, and may be used as the first line measure in treating Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in children.

T and B cell status in Bronchiolitis_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Immunologic status of 43 children, 13 with Bronchiolitis_HP and 30 with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was studied, and compared with 10 infants and 16 Healthy_HP children of respective control groups. Humoral immunity was assessed by absolute eosinophil count and B cell count (EAC Rosette_HP method) and cellular immunity by T cell count (E Rosette_HP method) and DNCB skin test. B cell subset of lymphocytes were raised in both the study groups but associated significant Eosinophilia_HP was seen only in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The study demonstrated significantly lower mean T cell count and depressed DNCB reactivity in children of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Children with Bronchiolitis_HP too had significantly lower mean T cell count. Thus both humoral and cellular immunity were altered in children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Bronchiolitis_HP.

[The assessment of the incidence of Food_Allergy_HP or intolerance in patients with respiratory Allergy_HP].In this study we have evaluated the possible relationship between food allergens and hypersensitivity to grass pollens. One hundred-thirty patients with grass pollen pollinosis and symptoms probably related to adverse reaction to foods were selected. Skin prick test for food allergens was positive in 79 patients (60.7%) Statistical analysis using chi-square test showed a high significant relationship between grass pollen and nuts, peanuts, beans and peas (p less than 0.0001). Elimination diet and challenge test allowed us to identify the responsible foods in 61 out 79 patients (77.2%). Twelve patients were Affected_HP by Food_Allergy_HP (challenge test, skin prick test and RAST positive and concordant); 49 patients suffered from intolerance. Possible causes of this high relationship are discussed.

Analysis of breathing pattern in children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The breathing pattern in children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was studied, using respiratory inductive plethysmography. The subjects were 31 children with Mild_HP to Moderate_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (15 males, 16 females; aged 6-15 years, average 11 years). The respiratory rate was 25.5 +/- 10.7/min. (mean +/- S.D.) during Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attacks and 18.4 +/- 5.0/min. between attacks with a significant increase during attacks (P less than 0.001). The expiratory time was 1.774 +/- 0.833 second during attacks, and 2.125 +/- 0.602 seconds between attacks. The expiratory time to total respiratory time ratio (TE/TTOT) was 0.631 +/- 0.056 during attacks and 0.608 +/- 0.035 between attacks. Thus there was a slight prolongation at the time of attack, but the difference was not significant. The tidal volume was increased slightly during Mild_HP and Moderate_HP attacks. VT/TI (mean inspiratory flow) was increased during attacks. The respiratory pattern was thoracic during attacks and changed to the abdominal pattern with improvement.

Double-blind evaluation of effectiveness and safety of flunisolide aerosol for treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in children.A double-blind study was carried out in 20 Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic children in order to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of inhaled corticosteroid flunisolide. 0.5 mg of the drug was administered by a jet nebulizer twice daily for 2 months. Respiratory symptoms, pulmonary function values and methacholine PC20-FEV1 were evaluated, as also morning cortisol levels, plasma cortisol increase after ACTH test, and 24-h urinary cortisol excretion. The data obtained show the efficacy of the drug in reducing symptoms. No significant difference was observed in pulmonary function values and in bronchial reactivity results between the two groups. No effect of flunisolide was observed on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function. This study confirms the efficacy and safety of flunisolide (0.5 mg b.i.d.) in the treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic children.

[Involvement of infections in asthmatic attack: with special reference to changes in leukocytes and eosinophils].Changes in leukocytes and eosinophils in 60 patients with non-infectious attack (NIA patients) were compared with those in 50 patients with infection-related attack (IRA patients). In 30 (50%) of the 60 NIA patients, Eosinophilia_HP without Leukocytosis_HP was observed on admission, and in 23 (76%) of these 30 patients Eosinophilia_HP disappeared within 2 weeks of admission. In 36 (72%) of the 50 IRA patients, Leukocytosis_HP without Eosinophilia_HP was observed on admission, and the periods from the Onset_HP of infection to admission were inversely correlated with leukocyte counts. In 22 Eosinophilia_HP patients among the 50 IRA patients, the periods from the Onset_HP of infection to admission were correlated with eosinophil counts for up to 40 days, and in 13 (76%) of 17 Eosinophilia_HP patients not receiving a long-term steroid therapy during admission, Eosinophilia_HP continued for more than 2 weeks even after anti-asthmatic and anti-infectious therapies. There was no significant difference in serum IgE levels between the two groups on admission. These results suggest that evaluations of leukocytes/eosinophils on admission and clinical courses are very useful in the management of asthmatic patients with or without Bacterial_Infections_ASDPTO.

[Suppressive effect of azelastine on the induction of Df antigen specific IL-2 responsiveness in lymphocytes from patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].Effect of azelastine on the induction of Dermatophagoides farinae (Df)-antigen specific IL-2 responsiveness of the lymphocytes was examined. Azelastine suppressed the induction of IL-2 responsiveness induced by Df antigen in Peripheral_HP blood mononuclear cells from patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in a dose dependent manner. Azelastine suppressed antigen presenting adherent cells but not non-adherent responder cells (T cell rich fraction). The antigen specific IL-2 responsiveness induced by purified protein derivative (PPD) in Healthy_HP adults was also suppressed by this drug, but not by concanavalin A (Con A). These data suggest that Azelastine suppresses the antigen specific lymphocyte reactions, and that these effects are based on the weak suppressive effect on antigen presenting and/or processing pathway.

[Relationship between bronchial reactivity to inhaled acetylcholine, eosinophil infiltration and a widening of the intercellular space in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].The hypothesis that epithelial damage is related to the development of bronchial hyperreactivity has been supported by many studies. Therefore, we further examined whether or not subjects with bronchial epithelium damage showed increased bronchial responsiveness. We took biopsy specimens of the airway mucosa from 20 asthmatic patients with various degrees of disease Severity_HP and bronchial hyperreactivity by using a bronchofiber scope. The morphology of the biopsy specimens was studied by electron microscopy. Bronchoscopy was carried out after local anesthesia. Specimens of bronchial mucosa were obtained from 20 asthmatic patients (14 males, 6 females) in remission. The electronmicroscopic studies showed widening of the intercellular space between the epithelial cells and openings of the tight junctions, as well as infiltrations of eosinophils and their granules beneath and between epithelial cells. The tight junction refers to the space between epithelial cells exposed to the airway surface, leading down to the intercellular space. The intercellular space refers to the space between epithelial cells, below the tight junction. Interestingly, eosinophils and their granules were found mainly in the widened intercellular space. The incidence of a widening of the intercellular space was higher in specimens showing eosinophil infiltration than in those not showing eosinophil infiltration. A significant correlation was found between the respiratory threshold to acetylcholine and the percentage of opened tight junctions (r = -0.47, p less than 0.05) and/or the widening of the space between epithelial cells (r = -0.65, p less than 0.01). These results suggest that widening of the intercellular space may be caused by infiltrations of eosinophils and that this widening increases bronchial reactivity.

Aerosol addiction.A case of dependency on prescribed pressurised aerosols in a patient with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Mild_HP mental handicap is reported. The majority of reported cases involve young asthmatics, abuse being reported mainly using salbutamol inhalers although other inhalers have also given cause for concern. The agent of addition is uncertain although it may be the fluorinated hydrocarbons used as propellants, rather than the active substance itself.

Treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP with tulobuterol or albuterol in school-age children.The subjects were 40 children aged 6 to 16 years with Stable_HP Chronic_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP; 20 were randomly assigned to receive 40 micrograms/kg of tulobuterol twice daily and 20 received 100 micrograms/kg of albuterol three times daily for three months. Patients were assessed by spirometry after the morning dose of medication at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment. After initial dosing, the mean percentage increases in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) were significantly higher in the tulobuterol-treated patients than in the albuterol-treated patients: at 30 minutes after dosing, the mean increase was 17.2% in the tulobuterol group and 5% in the albuterol group; at one hour, 20.3% and 6.8%. Similar results were found at 12 weeks. Mean changes in forced vital capacity and peak expiratory flow rate were similar to the changes in FEV1. Treatment side effects were reported by seven tulobuterol-treated patients and by four albuterol-treated patients. Tulobuterol treatment was withdrawn in one patient because of Severe_HP Vomiting_HP and Headache_HP of unknown cause. No changes in cardiovascular function were found in any patient. It is concluded that tulobuterol taken twice daily was more effective than albuterol taken three times daily in the treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in children.

Generation of oxygen free radicals from blood eosinophils from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP patients after stimulation with PAF or phorbol ester.Eosinophils (EOS) may play an important role in the pathophysiology of bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP because they can release oxygen free radicals and several basic proteins which are cytotoxic to bronchial epithelium. We have studied the response of EOS isolated from the blood of atopic subjects with symptoms of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (AS, n = 7) or Rhinitis_HP (AR, n = 4) or without symptoms (AA, n = 5) and of subjects with the hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES, n = 5). EOS were separated using metrizamide density gradients and activated in vitro with platelet-activating factor (PAF, 100 nM) or phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA, 100 nM). Oxygen free radical generation was assessed by a lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence (CL) assay. EOS purity was 83 +/- 1.7% (mean +/- SEM) with greater than 95% viability. Background CL responses of EOS from HES were significantly higher than those from AA (p less than 0.01) and AR (p less than 0.05). Normodense EOS from AS (PAF-induced CL = 90 +/- 27 mV) were more responsive to PAF than were those from AR (17 +/- 13 mV, p less than 0.01) and from AA (23 +/- 14 mV, p less than 0.01). Similar results were obtained with PMA. Hypodense EOS from HES subjects were as responsive as normodense EOS from AS to PMA and PFA. Thus, EOS from AS have an enhanced potential for activation, particularly by PAF; this may represent an important mechanism for the perpetuation of the inflammatory response in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, since EOS can also release PAF.

The relative contribution of bronchoalveolar macrophages and neutrophils to lucigenin- and luminol-amplified chemiluminescence.The relationship between differential cell counts and latex-stimulated luminol and lucigenin-amplified chemiluminescence (CL) was investigated by mixing alveolar macrophages (AM) obtained at bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) with allogeneic Peripheral_HP blood neutrophils (PMN) in varying proportions. In 5 non-asthmatic subjects, the mean luminol-amplified CL increased linearly from 2.1 (0.9 SEM) x 10(5) counts per second (cps) with less than 2% PMN, greater than 96% AM to 47.3 (11.1 SEM) x 10(5) cps with greater than 94% PMN, 0% AM (r = 0.996, p less than 0.001). The regression had a y-intercept indistinguishable from 0 cps, suggesting that luminol-amplified CL exclusively reflected PMN activity. Using the same technique, the mean lucigenin-amplified CL showed a fall from 35 (2.3 SEM) x 10(5) cps with a cell population of greater than 96% AM, less than 2% PMN to 20 (2.3 SEM) x 10(5) cps with 0% AM, greater than 94% PMN. Both PMN and AM appeared to contribute to lucigenin-amplified CL, with AM contributing approximately 1.7 times as much activity per cell as PMN. Lucigenin-amplified CL appeared to be an appropriate technique for measuring AM activity when the proportion of PMN in mixed cell populations was small. A linear relationship was found between percent PMN count and luminol-amplified CL measured in a mixed BAL cell population from asthmatic subjects (p less than 0.01) and non-asthmatic controls (p less than 0.01). The slope of this regression line was significantly greater for subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP than for control subjects (p less than 0.01), suggesting a uniform increase in PMN activity in cells obtained from asthmatic airways.

In 5 non-asthmatic subjects, the mean luminol-amplified CL increased linearly from 2.1 (0.9 SEM) x 10(5) counts per second (cps) with less than 2% PMN, greater than 96% AM to 47.3 (11.1 SEM) x 10(5) cps with greater than 94% PMN, 0% AM (r = 0.996, p less than 0.001). The regression had a y-intercept indistinguishable from 0 cps, suggesting that luminol-amplified CL exclusively reflected PMN activity. Using the same technique, the mean lucigenin-amplified CL showed a fall from 35 (2.3 SEM) x 10(5) cps with a cell population of greater than 96% AM, less than 2% PMN to 20 (2.3 SEM) x 10(5) cps with 0% AM, greater than 94% PMN. Both PMN and AM appeared to contribute to lucigenin-amplified CL, with AM contributing approximately 1.7 times as much activity per cell as PMN. Lucigenin-amplified CL appeared to be an appropriate technique for measuring AM activity when the proportion of PMN in mixed cell populations was small. A linear relationship was found between percent PMN count and luminol-amplified CL measured in a mixed BAL cell population from asthmatic subjects (p less than 0.01) and non-asthmatic controls (p less than 0.01). The slope of this regression line was significantly greater for subjects with asthma than for control subjects (p less than 0.01), suggesting a uniform increase in PMN activity in cells obtained from asthmatic airways.
Bronchial epithelium in humans recently recovering from Respiratory_tract_infection_HP caused by influenza or mycoplasma.Sixty three bronchial mucosal biopsies were collected from 12 patients recovering from Respiratory_tract_infection_HP with influenza virus (n = 8) and Mycoplasma (n = 4). The bronchoscopy was performed within 1-6 wks from the Onset_HP_of_Symptoms_ASDPTO. Of the 63 biopsies prepared for light microscopy, 27 biopsies from the influenza patients and 10 from the Mycoplasia patients were further analysed at the light and electron microscope level. The epithelium and the underlying stroma was analysed morphometrically and the results were compared to those of 39 biopsies from 27 Healthy_HP subjects. A slightly raised bronchial reactivity was noted in two patients. In the influenza patients the epithelial height was greater compared to that of the Healthy_HP subjects and subepithelial Lymphocytosis_HP was noted. Areas with damaged epithelium, epithelium shedding, and occasionally a thickened basement membrane, considered typical for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, occurred in both infected groups, and in the biopsies of the Healthy_HP subjects.

Peak inspiratory flow and inspiratory vital capacity of patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP measured with and without a new dry-powder inhaler device (Turbuhaler).In 101 asthmatic adults with varying degrees of bronchial obstruction, lung function tests including peak inspiratory flow (PIF), inspiratory vital capacity (IVC), peak expiratory flow (PEF), forced vital capacity (FVC), and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) measurements were made. Significant correlations between inspiratory and expiratory volumes were found. In most patients, PIF was less reduced than the expiratory parameters of pulmonary function. When inhalation was performed through the new multi-dose, dry-powder inhalation device, Turbuhaler (PIF-TBH), it was significantly lower than PIF measured without Turbuhaler. In previous studies, PIF-TBH of 30 l.min-1 or more has proven sufficient to produce a therapeutic dose of terbutaline, and to produce significant bronchodilatation. Of 101 asthmatics in the present study, only four had PIF-TBH of less than 30 l.min-1. Although no parameters of spirometry could accurately predict PIF-TBH, there was a tendency for patients with severely impaired ventilatory capacity to produce lower PIF-TBH than patients with normal or near-normal ventilatory capacity. If patients with severely impaired ventilatory capacity are to receive inhalation therapy through Turbuhaler, either PIF or PIF-TBH should be measured, or the effect should be carefully monitored.

[Use of stethoscope by mothers of asthmatic children ages 1-5].The mothers of 24 asthmatic children aged 1-5 years, who visited a department of family medicine at the time of the attacks, were assigned alternately to 2 groups. The experimental study group got guidance and instruction in the use of the stethoscope, and also participated in a self-management educational program led by the family physician. The control group only got guidance and participated in the latter program. The purpose of the study was to determine whether mothers could assume more responsibility in decision-making with regard to their children's asthmatic attacks after basic technical guidance in the use of the stethoscope and in the interpretation of auscultatory findings. The results show that the initial steps in self-management were adequate in the 2 groups. These included recognition of the first signs of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in the child, a relaxed attitude (not to panic), the dispensing of suitable amounts of fluid, and the administration of bronchodilator medication without waiting for the physician's examination. Instructions to continue bronchodilator drugs, both oral and by inhaler, were more detailed in the experimental group. During the year of follow-up there were fewer visits to the clinic and the emergency room and no hospital admissions by those in the experimental group. The main conclusion of this study is that in conjunction with a self-management program, it is possible to teach mothers to use a stethoscope, to correctly interpret the auscultatory findings and accordingly, to give adequate treatment. This reduces clinic and emergency room visits and hospital admissions, relieves Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP, and increases confidence in coping with this illness.

Relationship between the airway response to inhaled sulfur dioxide, isocapnic Hyperventilation_HP, and histamine in asthmatic subjects.To determine whether bronchoconstriction induced by sulfur dioxide can be predicted by the airway response to inhaled histamine, we exposed on two days 46 patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP to air or 0.5 ppm SO2. The exposure protocol consisted of 10 min of tidal breathing followed by 10 min of isocapnic Hyperventilation_HP at a rate of 30 l/min. Airway response was measured before (baseline) and after Hyperventilation_HP in terms of specific airway resistance, SRaw. Exposure to air increased baseline mean (SD) SRaw from 6.27 (2.12) to mean (SD) maximum post-Hyperventilation_HP SRaw of 9.10 (4.38) cmH2O*s (P less than 0.0001). Exposure to SO2 increased mean (SD) baseline SRaw from 6.93 (3.29) to mean (SD) maximum post-Hyperventilation_HP SRaw of 18.21 (18.69) cmH2O*s (P less than 0.0001). Mean (SD) effect of SO2 defined as difference between maximum post-Hyperventilation_HP SRaw after SO2 versus air was 9.11 (16.14) cm H2O*s. When evaluated individually, 26 and 34 of the 46 patients showed an airway response to Hyperventilation_HP of air and SO2, respectively. Airway response to histamine was determined as the histamine concentration necessary to increase specific airway resistance by 100%, PC100SRaw. The airway response after SO2 and PC100SRaw showed a weak but significant correlation (R = -0.48), whereas the responses to Hyperventilation_HP and SO2 did not correlate. We suggest that the mechanisms by which histamine and SO2 exert their bronchomotor effects are different and that in asthmatic patients the risk of pollutant-induced asthmatic symptoms can be poorly predicted by histamine responsiveness.

[Distribution and site of action of inhaled aerosols].Intrapulmonary distribution of nebulized aerosols and sites of air way Dilatation_HP following metered-dose aerosol delivery were studied by radionuclide methods. Aerosols penetrate to more Peripheral_HP site in slow inhalation and deposition of aerosols in diseased area was enhanced by release at a high lung volume. Pulmonary deposition of radioaerosols released from spacers was over 50% of activity in the spacer. Predominant site of bronchoDilatation_HP (beta-stimulant) was on large airways, though action on small airways was also noted.

[Corticosteroid--effects of beclomethasone dipropionate 800 micrograms/day].The effects of beclomethasone dipropionate (BD) 800 micrograms on steroid-dependent adult asthmatics were examined. The study consisted of two groups; 20 patients on 800 micrograms and another 20 patients on 400 micrograms. In addition, 800 micrograms was administered to an additional 12 patients receiving 400 micrograms with insufficient effects. After two weeks of observation period, BD was administered for 12 weeks, and its effects adverse reactions were analyzed on the basis of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP patients' diary etc. As the results, effects appeared earlier in the 800 micrograms group than in the 400 micrograms group and marked efficacy was seen. The 800 micrograms group was much better than the 400 micrograms group in the achievement of weaning from or of dose reduction of systemic steroid. A significant increase of serum cortisol levels which was considered to be due to the decrease of the systemic steroid usage was noted. Considerable efficacy was also observed in patients whose dosage had been increased from 400 micrograms to 800 micrograms. High dose administration usually increases topical side effects such as Hoarse_voice_HP and Stomatitis_HP, however the use of spacers was effective in the prophylaxis and treatment of those symptoms.

[Inhalation therapy for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. A. Bronchodilator--beta 2-stimulant].In the treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, usefulness of beta 2-agonists aerosol inhalation are emphasized as well as sustained theophylline tablets recently. In this study, the effectiveness of procaterol metered dose inhalor on Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients were examined compared with procaterol tables. The effect of procaterol inhalor together with sustained-theophylline on Holter ECG were also examined. When procaterol was exchanged to inhalation from tablets, 41% of the patients were improved symptomatically. Procaterol inhalor had no effect on Holter ECG. Procaterol inhalation regularly was expected to be more useful in treating Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic patients than tablets.

[Effect of a spacer device used with metered dose inhaler].Metered dose inhaler (MDI) is widely used in treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. But adequate efficacy is not obtained if the patients use an improper technique of inhalation. The spacer device was designed to reduce such inhalation errors. Three types of spacers (pear type, tube type, paper spacer) were studied to confirm their usefulness in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Bronchodilating effect of procaterol (10 micrograms/puff X 2) in conventional MDI or MDI with a spacer was evaluated. There were no significant difference in the effect on the pulmonary function after single inhalation of MDI with or without a spacer for 60 minutes. In regular use of MDI with a spacer for two weeks, PEFR and FEV1.0 were slightly improved. These results suggest that effect of MDI with a spacer may be more effective than MDI alone in regular use.

[A case of antithrombin III abnormality presenting as Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic symptom due to pulmonary Thromboembolism_HP].A 32-year-old housewife with AT III abnormality visited our out-patient clinic because of Dyspnea_HP on April 14, 1988, and was diagnosed as Asthma_ASDPTO_HP of non-atopic type. In spite of treatment, her Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic symptom did not improve. Therefore, she was admitted to our department on August 12 for a detailed examination and more effective therapy. Xanthine derivatives and beta 2 stimulant were ineffective, and only steroid hormone was effective to some degree. Pulmonary perfusion scan revealed that her pulmonary Thromboembolism_HP had become worse. Then she was treated with AT III concentrate and urokinase and her Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic symptom was significantly improved and steroid hormone could be easily reduced. Her Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic symptom was suggested to be due to progression of pulmonary Thromboembolism_HP. We were not able to find any other report of a case with AT III abnormality presenting as Asthma_ASDPTO_HP due to pulmonary Thromboembolism_HP.

Respiratory_distress_HP in a child in the office.We have reviewed Respiratory_distress_HP from a pathophysiologic approach. Two specific disease entities, epiglottitis and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, which commonly present with Respiratory_distress_HP, are reviewed. The office management of Respiratory_distress_HP encompasses early recognition of disease to prevent symptoms from progressing. Referral should be considered in any difficult cases.

Communication within low income families and the management of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.This study examines the effects of communication between low income urban parents and children about a Chronic_HP disease on the extent to which parent and child effectively manage the illness. Four Asthma_ASDPTO_HP communication factors were identified by principal component analysis. We found that mothers whose preferred language was Spanish, and families who were not receiving public assistance, communicated more frequently about Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in general. Spanish speaking mothers and their children communicated more about potential home treatments for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, and the more adults in the household the less there was communication about the need for emergency services for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Mothers who preferred to speak Spanish had higher levels of management of the most recent Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attack. Those whose children communicated with them about Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in general were higher level managers. Children who influenced their parents' decisions about school attendance, and those whose mothers were more highly educated, had higher levels of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attack management. More educated mothers, ones whose children were younger at the time of the Onset_HP of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, and one who received public assistance, were more involved "in general" in their child's Asthma_ASDPTO_HP care.

[Hemolytic_Anemia_HP induced by Chelidonium majus. Clinical case].A case of Hemolytic_Anemia_HP secondary to oral ingestion of a Chelidonium majus extract is presented. It coursed with intravascular haemolysis, Renal_insufficiency_HP, liver cytolysis and Thrombocytopenia_HP. The direct Antiglobulin test was positive (4+), IgG+C'. The patient was treated with steroids, red cell and platelet transfusion and also twice with an haemodialytic treatment, with complete resolution of the clinical features about the 12th day. A complete bibliographic revision from 1966-1989 was performed and no cases like this one were found during that period, so this could the first one reported.

[Consensus conference. The management of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in children].At this international consensus conference, a number of conclusions concerning the Diagnosis_ASDPTO and management of childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were reached. The following practical definition was given to Asthma_ASDPTO_HP: Recurrent_HP Wheezing_HP and/or Cough_HP in a clinical situation where Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is likely and less common diseases have been outruled. A thorough clinical history is essential to the Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Additional tests are used only to confirm the clinical impression and to provide objective evidence supporting therapeutic recommendations. Multidisciplinary management includes an evaluation of psychosocial factors and patient information. Drugs should be selected according to the Severity_HP of the condition: beta-2-agonists for Recurrent_HP Mild_HP Wheezing_HP; cromolyn sodium for Moderate_HP to Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP; xanthines, ipratropium bromide, and oral corticosteroids in more persistent and Severe_HP forms. The child and parents should be told that a normal, physically active life is quite possible if the disease is correctly controlled. The reward for correct management of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is resumption, in nearly every case, of a normal life including active participation in sports.

Using pulmonary function testing in the Diagnosis_ASDPTO and treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.asthmatics have remarkable changes in their pulmonary function in response to numerous external stimuli and internal controls. Serial pulmonary function testing in the office, hospital, at home, or the work place allows the objective measurement that is necessary to intelligently diagnose and treat these patients. Once the patient and the physician understand how to use the techniques for monitoring the degree of airways obstruction, they become a key in medical management decisions.

Diagnosis_ASDPTO of sulfite and aspirin sensitivity.In addition to the well-recognized allergic responses of individuals to high mol wt substances, such as pollens, molds, and animal dander, susceptible asthmatics may also experience adverse reactions to low mol wt substances such as sulfites, ASA, and NSAIDs. The Diagnosis_ASDPTO of sulfite and aspirin sensitivity can only be made by appropriately conducted provocative challenge. Every precaution should be taken to assure the safety of the patients, since life-threatening reactions can occur. A better understanding of the mechanism or mechanisms involved in the adverse reactions to these substances will not only provide information to better diagnose the reaction, but also improve our understanding of the treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Actual usage of medical facilities by asthmatics in two French rural settings: a preliminary study.Until recently the medical management of asthmatic patients with respect to their socio-cultural environment had only been superficially studied. Four hundred and fifty eight adult asthmatics were identified through a two-stage questionnaire in two rural districts of south west France. The study has mainly demonstrated: 1) the large number of subjects experiencing more than one attack per week (33% in Gironde, 40% in Lot et Garonne); 2) the large number of subjects feeling disabled in their occupational and day-to-day life (52% in Gironde, 54% in Lot et Garonne); 3) the absence of a relationship between the Severity_HP of the disease and the use of medical facilities in the community. Despite the Frequency_HP of the attacks and the perceived disability, 27% of the patients felt that their Asthma_ASDPTO_HP did not require any treatment and up to 60% did not seek medical help even during an attack; 4) the role of population density, type of dwelling and social status in the management of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. We conclude that under-treatment is widespread in these two rural settings and is closely related with the association of at least two of these three characteristics: 1) living in a low population density area; 2) living in an isolated dwelling; and 3) being a farm owner.

Clinical assessment after a life-threatening attack of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP; the role of bronchial hyperreactivity.Between 1973 and 1986, 19 patients were treated on 21 occasions for life-threatening attacks of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Twelve times mechanical ventilation was needed. None of the patients died. Most of the patients had been recognized as Severe_HPly asthmatic before the life-threatening attack. Thirteen out of the 19 patients had previously been admitted with a Severe_HP asthmatic attack. All patients, except one, were already using maintenance treatment, and 17 had previously been referred to a pulmonologist. During follow-up the bronchial obstruction was, in most cases, fully reversible while using a rather extensive maintenance treatment (maximum forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), 69-138% of predicted). Recently, 17 of the 19 patients were reinvestigated, while in Stable_HP phase. The patients who had been mechanically ventilated were significantly more sensitive to inhaled histamine than the patients who had not been mechanically ventilated. This was not explained by any difference in basal FEV1 % pred or dosage of corticosteroids. A very low provocation concentration of histamine producing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20) may indicate the risk of a Severe_HP, life-threatening attack of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

The daily variability of bronchial responsiveness to methacholine.Ten Mild_HP atopic asthmatics on inhaled beta 2-agonists alone were studied in order to determine the repeatability of methacholine inhalation provocation tests at 24 h intervals over a period of 5 days. Such patients are most frequently studied in therapeutic trials of anti-asthmatic Medications_ASDPTO. There were no significant differences in results obtained on any of the days and no evidence for the development of tolerance to methacholine in this group of patients at one day intervals. The 95% confidence interval for repeatability of the results was +/- 1.05 doubling doses of methacholine, and 95% range +/- 2.36 doubling doses, comparable to the results obtained by other investigators on similar patients. Some investigators have produced more highly repeatable results but these have generally been obtained using highly selected groups of patients.

Intravenous enprofylline in the treatment of patients with Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The safety and efficacy of enprofylline were studied in 55 moderately Severe_HP asthmatic patients [forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) no more than 50% of predicted values] presenting with an Acute_HP attack. A bolus injection of 1.5 mg/kg enprofylline was given over 20 min and then maintenance infusion of 0.4 mg/kg.h enprofylline for up to 24 h. On admission, 200 mg hydrocortisone was administered intravenously and additional oxygen and/or inhaled beta 2-agonist therapy was permitted after 1 h; this additional therapy was given to 39 patients. The bolus injection increased the PEFR from 121 +/- 44 l/min to 164 +/- 49 l/min at 20 min, with a further improvement during the maintenance infusion to 200 +/- 79 l/min at 24 h. Heart rate and blood pressure decreased towards normal in parallel with the improvement in lung function. The mean steady-state enprofylline plasma concentration was slightly higher than predicted. The mean renal clearance and recovery of enprofylline from urine were in good agreement with results previously obtained from Healthy_HP Caucasian subjects.

Clinical evaluation of tulobuterol aerosol in childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.An open clinical trial was performed to assess the efficacy and safety of 400 micrograms tulobuterol aerosol given four times daily in childhood bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. A total of 54 children were enrolled with bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP shown to be reversible by an increase of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) of more than 15% following 200 micrograms of salbutamol. Tulobuterol was administered for 3 weeks and regular use of salbutamol was continued for 12 patients during the 7-day lead-in period and six patients took theophylline throughout the study; other drugs were discontinued. The mean FEV1, mean adjusted FEV1, mean peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and mean forced vital capacity (FVC) were significantly increased (P less than 0.001) following treatment. Mean FEV1 increases ranged from 9.2% to 14.0%, with 24.5-43.4% of patients showing clinically significant increases of at least 15%. Globally, there was improvement in 46 patients (85%). Headache_HP and nervous system complaints were the most common side-effects. Although this was an uncontrolled study, the indications are that tulobuterol aerosol is effective and safe for use in children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Allergens and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.In many medical textbooks allergens are still listed as one of the "trigger factors" for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, with the implication that Irritability_HP of the lungs is an underlying physiologic property of the lungs. Over the last few years it has become clear that Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is an inflammatory disease. In addition, it has been shown that changes in allergen exposure can lead to changes in bronchial reactivity. These results lead to the view that continued allergen exposure of the lungs of allergic individuals with resulting "inflammation" is an important primary cause of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. In parallel with this has come a Progressive_HP increase in awareness and understanding of the importance of house dust allergens. In many parts of the world, the dust mite dominates house dust Allergy_HP and appears to be responsible for up to 85% of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. In the United States three indoor allergens appear to play an equal role: dust mites, cats, and cockroaches. In the future, management of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP will increasingly focus on allergen avoidance both as a method of treating symptomatic allergic patients and also as an approach to controlling the development of a disease which currently has increasing morbidity and mortality.

Recalcitrant Asthma_ASDPTO_HP: an allergist's approach.Patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP who have incomplete control of their symptoms or require regular systemic steroidal therapy are said to have recalcitrant Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. A systematic approach may significantly improve quality of life. Factors that should be evaluated include living with an antigen, occupational exposure, use of beta-adrenoreceptor blockers, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, sensitivity to dietary chemicals, endocrinopathies, Gastroesophageal_reflux_HP, Sinusitis_HP, bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and noncompliance. Other diseases may mimic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP or exacerbate nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivity. These include Congestive_heart_failure_HP, Chronic_HP infectious Bronchitis_HP resulting from cystic fibrosis, ciliary dysfunction syndrome, and Immunodeficiency_HP syndromes, Upper_airway_obstruction_HP, pertussis syndrome, psychogenic coughs, Bronchiolitis_HP_obliterans_HP, Chronic_HP eosinophilic Pneumonia_HP, and vasculitides. A systematic approach to the evaluation of coexisting factors and potential exacerbating diseases is presented.

[Pharmacokinetics of Teolin 300 tablets and Teotard 350 capsules in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP patients].Pharmacokinetics of tablets Teolin 300 (TT) and capsules Teotard 350 (TC) was studied in 7 Asthma_ASDPTO_HP patients. Serum theophylline concentrations (SCT) were measured in 2-h intervals over 2 consecutive days for each theophylline formulation. A randomized, crossover design was used. In 12-h one dose of TT was absorbed 89.76 +/- 32.76% (means +/- SD) and TC 83.76 +/- 49.48%; between them there were statistically no differences. Amplitudes of SCT (AMP) were in the range 0.31 to 2.7 and mean 24-h SCT in the range 19.8 to 119.3 mumol/L. AMP were reproducible only to TT (r = 0.97, p less than 0.001). Fourier's harmonic analysis applied to mean SCT disclosed statistically significant 12-h oscillations only for TT (p less than 0.05). Continuous therapy with slow-release theophylline should always be monitored with measurements of SCT which should be interpreted by pharmacokinetics data of applied sustained theophylline formulation.

[Calcium-regulating system in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP].Calcium homeostasis was determined from ionized calcium (Ca2+), total calcium (Cat) and bound calcium (Cab) levels, content of calcium-regulating hormones: calcitonin (CT) and parathyroid hormone (PTH). Lipid peroxidation (LPO) Severity_HP was assessed from the blood plasma hydroperoxide level in 71 patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Chronic_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic Bronchitis_HP. The findings evidence that high blood serum levels of Ca2+ and Cab and a tendency to reduction of PTH content are characteristic of nonsevere and medium-Severity_HP atopic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. In bacterial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Ca2+ level increases at the expense of Cab, that is parallelled by elevation of CT content, as the disease progresses in Severity_HP. Blood CT level gradually decreases until it disappears completely in Stage III bacterial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, whereas PTH level grows. CT/PTH ratio may be an indicator of disturbed equilibrium in the CT-PTH hormonal system. In the course of treatment Ca2+ binding, most manifest in bacterial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, increases, CT level grows and PTH one reduces. A tendency to normalization of hormonal levels resultant from therapy does not eventuate in their complete recovery; hormonal levels remain shifted, this pointing to the essential contribution of endocrine mechanisms to calcium homeostasis disorders in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

[Evaluation of individual sensitivity to levamisole in children with asthmatic Bronchitis_HP].Individual sensitivity to levamisole, an immunostimulant, may be tested by measurement of the blood plasma cyclic nucleotides and computation of the cAMP/cGMP coefficient. Detection of individual sensitivity to this drug in children suffering from asthmatic Bronchitis_HP contributes to the therapy efficacy.

The epidemiology of idiopathic Dilated_Cardiomyopathy_HP in a biracial community.An epidemiologic study of idiopathic Dilated_Cardiomyopathy_HP was carried out in order to identify possible risk factors for this often fatal cause of Congestive_heart_failure_HP in young adults. Possible associations with black race and other genetic and environmental factors were examined by comparing newly diagnosed cases ascertained from four Baltimore hospitals (n = 95) with neighborhood controls (n = 95), matched on sex and 5-year age intervals. Matched and unmatched relative odds and conditional logistic regression coefficients were obtained to describe the associations. Statistically significant, independent associations were observed between idiopathic Dilated_Cardiomyopathy_HP and black race, low annual income, and history of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (p less than 0.05). The black predominance (relative odds = 2.7, 95% confidence interval 2.0-3.4) was not explained by income, alcohol consumption, cigarette usage, body mass index, Hypertension_HP, or Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. A possible interactive effect was observed between black race and history of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and other atopic diseases. Thus, blacks, especially those with a history of hypersensitivity, may represent a high-risk subgroup in need of preventive care or early intervention.

The effect of a patient education program on emergency room use for inner-city children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.An educational program for children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP designed to reduce emergency room (ER) use enrolled all eligible children (n = 253 primarily low-income Black) within a health maintenance organization (HMO) who had used the hospital or ER for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP during the pre-enrollment period and randomized them into two groups. Twenty-four of the experimental group patients had 55 ER visits and 18 of the control patients had 39 ER visits during the first 12 months post-intervention. This program did not achieve its goal.

Increased paediatric admissions with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in Western Australia--a problem of Diagnosis_ASDPTO?A study of hospital admissions of paediatric cases with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP over a 17-year period (1971-1987) in Western Australia was performed retrospectively. Hospital admission rates for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP increased in all paediatric age-groups with the most dramatic increase occurring in the youngest (zero- to four-years') age-group. This increase in hospital admissions for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP has been accompanied by a rapid decline in admissions for other paediatric respiratory conditions that share a potential diagnostic overlap with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Hospital admission rates for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP have reached a plateau at the major paediatric teaching hospital in the State from 1977 and Statewide from 1983. Diagnostic transfer has contributed significantly to the reported increase in hospital admissions for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP over the past two decades.

Mortality from Chronic_HP obstructive pulmonary diseases and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in France, 1969-1983. Comparisons with the United States and Canada.This article focuses on international similarities and differences in levels and trends of mortality for Chronic_HP obstructive pulmonary disease (Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP) and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in the US, Canada and France from 1969 to 1983. Comparisons have been made of national vital statistics data for age groups 55-64 years, 65-74 years and 75-84 years. From 1969 to 1978, under the 8th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), the Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP category included the codes 490-493 and, for the US and Canada, a special code 519.3. From 1979, under the 9th revision, Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP codes 490-493, 496 were in use in all three countries. The analyses of US, Canadian and French data show lower death rates for Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in France. The ratio of male to female deaths from Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP increased with age in the US and Canada, but not in France. The proportion of Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP and Asthma_ASDPTO_HP deaths attributed to Bronchitis_HP was higher in France. An increased use of code 496 (under 9th revision) was observed in the US and above all in Canada. In the three countries, death rates increased faster between 1979 and 1983 in women than in men and increases in women were steeper in the US and Canada than in France. Intercountry comparability is better for Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_HP mortality in the 9th revision than the 8th revision. Some differences observed between the three countries can be partly explained by coding practices and ICD revisions, but, allowing for differences in coding and classifying respiratory causes of death as well as ICD revisions, death rates are obviously higher in the US and Canada than in France. This suggests that the difference is real.
Mortality from chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and asthma in France, 1969-1983. Comparisons with the United States and Canada.This article focuses on international similarities and differences in levels and trends of mortality for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma in the US, Canada and France from 1969 to 1983. Comparisons have been made of national vital statistics data for age groups 55-64 years, 65-74 years and 75-84 years. From 1969 to 1978, under the 8th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), the COPD and asthma category included the codes 490-493 and, for the US and Canada, a special code 519.3. From 1979, under the 9th revision, COPD and asthma codes 490-493, 496 were in use in all three countries. The analyses of US, Canadian and French data show lower death rates for COPD and asthma in France. The ratio of male to female deaths from COPD increased with age in the US and Canada, but not in France. The proportion of COPD and asthma deaths attributed to bronchitis was higher in France. An increased use of code 496 (under 9th revision) was observed in the US and above all in Canada. In the three countries, death rates increased faster between 1979 and 1983 in women than in men and increases in women were steeper in the US and Canada than in France.

A double-blind trial of oral immunotherapy for Artemisia pollen Asthma_ASDPTO_HP with evaluation of bronchial response to the pollen allergen and serum-specific IgE antibody.Eighteen asymptomatic Artemisia pollen Asthma_ASDPTO_HP patients with normal pulmonary function were selected for a double-blind trial of oral immunotherapy. Each patient had a positive skin test to Artemisia pollen extract and also a positive bronchial challenge response to the same extract. The patients were randomly assigned to active treatment or placebo group and received intensive oral administration of Artemisia pollen extract over a 50-day course. The nine patients who received the active treatment ingested a cumulative dose of 396,652 PNU and showed a significant decrease in serum-specific IgE antibodies (P less than .05) and a significant reduction in bronchial sensitivity to the same extract (P less than .01). The changes in these two variables correlated well (r = .8787, P less than .01). The nine patients who received the placebo showed no significant changes in serum-specific IgE or bronchial sensitivity to Artemisia pollen extract. Follow-up of two cases with the same extract showed that the reductions in serum-specific IgE as well as bronchial sensitivity induced by oral immunotherapy were maintained for 3 months.

Hemothorax_HP in a patient with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Treatment of Chronic_HP illnesses such as Asthma_ASDPTO_HP can often become routine. This is a case report that emphasizes the importance of a thorough history and physical examination for each exacerbation of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. An 11-year-old girl with a history of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP presented to the emergency room with Wheezing_HP and Dyspnea_HP that was assumed to be an exacerbation of her Chronic_HP illness. After careful history taking and physical examination, a chest radiograph was recommended. The x-ray revealed a Hemothorax_HP and a new Diagnosis_ASDPTO was made, thoracic Ewing_Sarcoma_HP.

Frequency_HP of inhaled metaproterenol in the treatment of Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP exacerbation.Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP exacerbations are common complaints in patients who present to the emergency department. A prospective, double-blinded study was designed to evaluate how Frequency_HP of dosing of an inhaled beta-agonist, metaproterenol (Alupent inhalation solution) would Affect_ASDPTO patient response, length of stay in the ED, and admission rates. Forty-one patients initially received a 0.3-mL dose of nebulized metaproterenol followed by two additional doses of either metaproterenol or saline every 20 minutes. While there was no difference in response (forced expiratory volume in one second) in patients at 30 minutes after their arrival, there was an improved response in the metaproterenol group at 60 and 120 minutes. The length of stay in the ED was approximately the same for both groups. There was no significant difference in admission rates. No increase in undesirable side effects (eg, Nausea_HP, Tremor_HP, Palpitations_HP) was seen in the metaproterenol-treated group. Frequent_HP dosing of metaproterenol is useful in asthmatics having Acute_HP exacerbations and leads to rapid improvement without an increase in toxicity.

Respiratory and skeletal muscle function in steroid-dependent Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Respiratory and skeletal (deltoid) muscle strength were evaluated in 34 oral steroid-dependent Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics by use of maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures and a myometer. The patients were compared to age- and sex-matched Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics who had never been on continuous oral steroid treatment. Endurance time was also studied in ten steroid-dependent Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics and ten controls using a pressure threshold breathing device. Nutritional status was assessed from body weight, midarm circumference, triceps skinfold (TSF), prealbumin, albumin, and total protein. An open biopsy from deltoid muscle was taken from nine steroid-dependent Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics and the diameter of type 1 and type 2 fibers was measured by a morphometric study. No differences were found between study and control groups either in respiratory and skeletal muscle strength or in endurance time. Steroid-dependent Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtics showed a decrease in TSF, total protein, albumin, and potassium serum levels when compared with the control group but differences were not statistically significant after Bonferroni's adjustment for multiple comparison studies. Transversal diameter of type 2 fibers was significantly correlated with the percentage of ideal weight (r = 0.75 p less than 0.05), but not with average daily dose of steroids nor with the length of steroid treatment. Our results support the clinical impression that steroids, at the doses usually administered in Chronic_HP Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, do not cause Muscle_weakness_HP. We also found that Malnutrition_HP rather than corticosteroids is the most important contributory factor to Type_2_muscle_fiber_atrophy_HP in steroid-dependent Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Effects of a PAF-antagonist (BN 52063) on bronchoconstriction and platelet activation during exercise induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.1. The effects of a specific PAF acether antagonist (BN 52063) on the response to isocapnic Hyperventilation_HP with dry cold air (ISH study) and exercise (EIA study) were assessed in a single dose and short term treatment study in 10 patients with exercise induced Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. 2. ISH challenge was performed twice within 1 h after administration of either placebo, 240 mg BN 52063 p.o. or inhalation of 2.4 mg BN 52063. Hyperventilation_HP increased Raw from 0.30 +/- 0.02 to 0.89 kPa s l-1 (P less than 0.001) after the first challenge and from 0.28 +/- 0.04 to 0.84 +/- 0.06 kPa s l-1 (P less than 0.001) after the second challenge. Oral pretreatment with BN 52063 did not result in a reduction of bronchoconstriction during both challenges. A significant increase of Raw was noted immediately after inhalation of BN 52063. An inhibition of PAF induced platelet aggregation (by a factor of 2) occurred after oral administration of BN 52063 after both ISH challenges (P less than 0.05). No significant inhibition of PAF induced platelet aggregation was seen after inhalation of BN 52063. At concentrations up to 30 microM in vitro, BN 52063 inhibited PAF induced platelet aggregation in a dose dependent manner. The IC50 of BN 52063 against the aggregating effect of 1 microM PAF was 7.0 +/- 2.1 microM. 3. In the EIA study the patients were challenged on the third day of treatment with either placebo or 240 mg BN 52063 p.o. or 5 mg BN 52063 by inhalation. Peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) fell by 155 +/- 37 1 min-1 after exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Bronchodilating effect of intravenous magnesium sulfate in Acute_HP Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.We investigated the bronchodilating effect of intravenous MgSO4 in Acute_HP Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Infusion of MgSO4 caused a significant improvement in FEV1 (0.94 +/- 0.39L to 1.3 +/- 0.44 L) and an improvement in clinical signs and symptoms in ten out of 12 administrations. The bronchodilating effect of MgSO4, however, was significantly less than that of subsequent albuterol inhalation (FEV1 improvement from 1.13 +/- 0.41 L to 1.72 +/- 0.49 L). These findings confirm that intravenous MgSO4 may be used as an adjunct to classic beta 2-agonist therapy in cases of Severe_HP Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP; its exact place in the treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP remains to be determined in large-scale studies.

Decreased paradoxic pulse from increased venous return in Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.During Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, paradoxic pulse may result from increased impedance to Left_HP ventricular ejection, mechanical impairment of Left_HP ventricular filling by ventricular interdependence or decreased pulmonary venous return augmented by Hypovolemia_HP. We studied the effect of reversible blood volume expansion by MAST inflation during Severe_HP attacks of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Ten patients with clinically detectable paradoxic pulse of more than 20 mm Hg were studied. All had a history of reversible bronchial Asthma_ASDPTO_HP with evidence of respiratory and circulatory failure. Standard therapy for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was started. We observed no difference in respiratory and heart rates during MAST inflation. Paradoxic pulse was consistently decreased during MAST inflation; paradoxic pulse returned to baseline values after MAST deflation. The decrease in paradoxic pulse was produced by an increased inspiratory systolic arterial pressure. We conclude that a reduction in pulmonary venous return is more important than ventricular interdependence in producing paradoxic pulse during Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

[Bowmaker's disease: an occupational disease in the manufacture of bows for string instruments].Inhalation of wood dust from the tropical tree Fernambouc (Caesalpinia echinata) in the manufacture of string bows can cause characteristic symptoms (bow-makers disease). To confirm this observation, 177 bow-makers, working in a village near Erlangen (Bavaria), the centre of this manufacture, filled in questionnaires. Of these 36 worked with Fernambouc, 141 with other types of wood. Twelve out of these 36 suffered from dyspnoea, Cough_HP, sneezing impulses, Epiphora_HP and coryza, which would disappear quickly at weekends and during holidays. 14 of those working with other types of wood merely had sneezing, irritation of the mucosa, a few also Cough_HP, dyspnoea and Epiphora_HP. Extracts of Fernambouc splinters were made for serological testing. However, neither experimental sensitization in animals nor skin tests in the twelve gave allergic reactions. A 51-year-old woman with long-standing Asthma_ASDPTO_HP developed dyspnoea five minutes after an inhalative provocation test; a prick test brought about slight infiltration. Thus, no evidence of an allergic origin of symptoms from Fernambouc dust inhalation could be elicited.

Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attack periodicity: a study of hospital emergency visits in Vancouver.Attendances at the emergency departments of the nine Acute_HP care hospitals serving the Vancouver region, with a population of just under a million people, were recorded from July 1, 1984 to October 31, 1986. Of about 25,500 visits a month, 2.7% were for respiratory conditions; and of these, 41.3% were for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Data from 11 air monitoring stations were also tabulated on a daily basis, giving mean maximal hourly values for SO2, NO2, and O3; daily aerosol sulfate measurements from one station were also analyzed, together with daily temperature data and measurements of the coefficient of haze. In 3 consecutive years, a peak in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attendances was noted, starting in the last week of September, and continuing for 3 weeks. In these periods, weekly visits for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP reached 130 patients; during the rest of the year, the weekly visits for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP varied between 30 and 90. This peak Affected_HP children and adults between the ages of 15 and 60, but no increase was seen in those over 60 years. Although pollution levels increased sharply in the fall, a day-by-day analysis showed that the rise in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attendances preceded the increase in NO chi and SO2 levels for the region, expressed as the mean of the hourly maxima across all stations. It seems unlikely that a specific pollen is responsible for this, or that house mite replication is the cause. Soya beans are not shipped out of Vancouver. The cause of the peak has not been identified. Variations in emergency visits by day of the week have been recorded; in children and in those aged 15-60, more visits occur on Sundays than on other days, but this does not occur in those over 60. There is no significant variation in environmental data by day of the week. Intercorrelations between environmental variables and emergency visits have been calculated separately for the periods May 1 to October 31, and November 1 to April 31. SO2, NO2, and SO4 are strongly intercorrelated in both periods; ozone is strongly related to temperature, but less strongly correlated to sulfate than is the case in Southern Ontario. In summer, total emergency visits (but not respiratory visits) are strongly correlated with temperature in all age groups (the hotter the day, the more visits occur); but respiratory visits are not related to temperature, ozone, or NO2 levels. However, in the 15-60 age group, Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and respiratory visits are correlated in summer with SO2 and SO4 levels (P = less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

Allergy_HP in subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP from childhood to adulthood.We studied the change from childhood to adulthood in skin test reactivity to house dust, animal dander, grass pollen, and molds, and, in addition, the change in number of blood eosinophils. The study was carried out in a group of 119 children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, aged 6 to 14 years first observed between 1966 and 1969. In the present study, 101 subjects (85%) were reinvestigated after a mean period of 16 years; 43% had current symptoms. Skin test reactivity to all allergens and the number of subjects with positive skin tests to more than one allergen increased from childhood to adulthood. Subjects with Allergic_Rhinitis_HP (38%) had a higher number of positive skin tests to grass pollen in both childhood and adulthood than subjects without Allergic_Rhinitis_HP. Fifty-three children and 10 adults had Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP. Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP occurred with equal Frequency_HP in children who did and in children who did not have current symptoms later in life. No differences in skin test reactivity to allergens were found between Smoking_ASDPTO and nonSmoking_ASDPTO subjects. Although the Smoking_ASDPTO period was relatively short, Smoking_ASDPTO was correlated with Eosinophilia_HP in adulthood. The mean number of eosinophils decreased significantly between the first and second survey. The outcome of childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP as defined by current symptoms was not predicted by skin reactivity to allergens, Eosinophilia_HP, Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP, or Allergic_Rhinitis_HP in childhood.
Allergy_HP in subjects with asthma from childhood to adulthood.We studied the change from childhood to adulthood in skin test reactivity to house dust, animal dander, grass pollen, and molds, and, in addition, the change in number of blood eosinophils. The study was carried out in a group of 119 children with asthma, aged 6 to 14 years first observed between 1966 and 1969. In the present study, 101 subjects (85%) were reinvestigated after a mean period of 16 years; 43% had current symptoms. Skin test reactivity to all allergens and the number of subjects with positive skin tests to more than one allergen increased from childhood to adulthood. Subjects with allergic rhinitis (38%) had a higher number of positive skin tests to grass pollen in both childhood and adulthood than subjects without allergic rhinitis. Fifty-three children and 10 adults had atopic dermatitis. Atopic dermatitis occurred with equal frequency in children who did and in children who did not have current symptoms later in life. No differences in skin test reactivity to allergens were found between smoking and nonsmoking subjects. Although the smoking period was relatively short, smoking was correlated with eosinophilia in adulthood. The mean number of eosinophils decreased significantly between the first and second survey. The outcome of childhood asthma as defined by current symptoms was not predicted by skin reactivity to allergens, eosinophilia, atopic dermatitis, or allergic rhinitis in childhood.

Exposure-response relationships in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP caused by tetrachlorophthalic anhydride.Four patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP caused by occupational exposure to tetrachlorophthalic anhydride (TCPA) had dust-challenge tests that used eight different levels of TCPA exposure. Measurements of TCPA in the test-cubicle air ranged from 1.3 to 961.1 micrograms/m3. The higher Exposures_ASDPTO provoked definite late or dual asthmatic responses. Smaller, but statistically significant, responses were observed at low Exposures_ASDPTO. The late asthmatic-response area had a linear relation to the logarithm of TCPA exposure, but the immediate asthmatic response was less closely related to exposure.

Long-term effects of aspirin desensitization--treatment for aspirin-sensitive rhinoSinusitis_HP-Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.One hundred seven known aspirin (ASA)-sensitive patients with rhinoSinusitis_HP-Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were studied from 1975 to 1988. Forty-two of the patients avoided ASA and served as the control group. Thirty-five patients were desensitized to ASA and treated with daily ASA treatment (Rx) for as long as 8 years (mean, 3.75 years) to May 1988 and were designated the continuous group. Thirty patients, initially desensitized to ASA and treated with daily ASA, who stopped Rx permanently after a mean duration of 2 years, were designated the discontinued group. Retrospective analyses of baselines revealed that both continuous and discontinued groups during ASA Rx demonstrated statistically significant reduction in number of Hospitalizations_ASDPTO per year, emergency room visits per year, outpatient visits per year, upper Respiratory_tract_infection_HP-Sinusitis_HP-antibiotics per year, need for nasal polypectomies and additional sinus operations, and improvement in sense of smell compared to the control group. Simultaneously, the ASA-Rx groups were able to significantly reduce systemic corticosteroid dosage, corticosteroid bursts per year, and, in the continuous group only, significantly reduce inhaled corticosteroids. All three groups maintained control of respiratory symptoms. ASA desensitization followed by long-term daily ASA Rx appears to improve ASA-sensitive rhinoSinusitis_HP-Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and concomitantly allows reduction of systemic corticosteroids.

Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and heterozygous alpha 1-antichymotrypsin deficiency: a possible association.During studies of families with alpha 1-antichymotrypsin deficiency heterozygotes, an apparently increased prevalence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP among first degree relatives was noticed. In a case control study, the prevalence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP among first degree relatives of 12 women with heterozygous alpha 1-antichymotrypsin deficiency was compared with that of first degree relatives of 58 matched controls. Secondly, the strength of association between Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and low or subnormal plasma ACT concentration, in first and second degree relatives to heterozygotes, was assessed. The prevalence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP among first degree relatives of women with heterozygous alpha 1-antichymotrypsin deficiency was significantly higher [prevalence ratio 3.22 (1.06-9.83), P = 0.04]. Among heterozygotes, the prevalence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in first and second degree relatives with low plasma alpha 1-antichymotrypsin concentration was higher than in relatives with normal plasma ACT concentration, but the difference in prevalence did not reach statistical significance [prevalence ratio 3.1 (0.96-9.83), P = 0.059]. The findings are in agreement with previous studies and suggest a possible association between Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and heterozygous alpha 1-antichymotrypsin deficiency.

Diagnostic value of body plethysmographic parameters in Healthy_HP and asthmatic young children is not influenced by breathing Frequency_HP.In 16 Healthy_HP and 16 asymptomatic asthmatic children (age range 5-8 yr; 8 girls, 24 boys) we studied the influence of breathing Frequency_HP on the results and the diagnostic value of body plethysmographic measurements. Airway resistance (Raw), specific airway resistance (SRaw), and thoracic gas volume (TGV) were measured during breathing (or breathing efforts against a closed shutter) at 0.4, 1, and 2 Hz. SRaw was computed by a simplified procedure directly from flow at the mouth vs. box volume-curves. The diagnostic value of each parameter was assessed as the percentage of correctly classified Healthy_HP and asthmatic subjects by means of discriminant analysis. When Frequency_HP was increased from 0.4 to 1 and 2 Hz mean TGV rose by 5 and 14% in Healthy_HP children and by 11 and 21% in asthmatic children, respectively. From 0.4 to 1 Hz mean Raw decreased by 16% (P = 0.002) in Healthy_HP children and by 25% (P = 0.0004) in asthmatic children. The differences in Raw between both groups decreased with Frequency_HP (3.5, 1.8, and 1.5 cm H2O.L-1.s at 0.4, 1, and 2 Hz, respectively) and those of TGV increased (0.13, 0.21, and 0.23 L). SRaw showed similar Frequency_HP characteristics as Raw. As intra-group variability changed in parallel with the differences the diagnostic value of the parameters remained constant with Frequency_HP. Simplified SRaw alone and TGV combined with Raw exhibited no differences in their diagnostic values (81-84% correctly classified).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Combination of atropine and isoetharine aerosol therapy in pediatric Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Seventeen hospitalized children with Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, ages 7 to 15 years, were studied to determine the efficacy of simultaneous administration of atropine sulfate and isoetharine. Combination therapy was superior in 11/17 (65%) patients while isoetharine alone was superior in 4/17 (23%) patients (P = .037). We conclude that simultaneous administration of combination therapy is safe and beneficial in some children with Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Effect of inhaled triamcinolone on bronchial hyperreactivity and airways obstruction in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.We measured changes in methacholine bronchial hyperreactivity and airways obstruction in 37 asthmatics treated with inhaled triamcinolone for 6 weeks. All received regular bronchodilator therapy but not steroids or cromolyn. Initial studies included spirometry and the provocative concentration of methacholine required to decrease the FEV1 by 20% (PC20). Patients were randomized into two groups: those given inhaled triamcinolone, 200 micrograms four times daily (T) by metered dose inhaler, and those given a placebo inhaler (P). Daily AM and PM peak flow measurements were recorded, while PC20 and pulmonary function tests were obtained at 3 and 6 weeks. Change in canister weight was used to determine treatment compliance. The PC20 of T increased from a baseline 1.00 mg/mL to 2.90 mg/mL at 6 weeks, whereas in P it decreased from 1.15 mg/mL to 1.05 mg/mL. Percent change in PC20 (delta PC20) for each patient was defined as: [(PC20(week 6)--PC20(baseline]/PC20 (baseline)] X 100. At 6 weeks, this was 290% in T versus 65% in P (P less than .05). Likewise, at 6 weeks T was significantly greater than P with respect to: delta FEV1 (4.1% versus -3.8%, P less than .05) and delta FEF25-75% (20.3% versus -5.6%, P less than .01). Patients were further separated into higher and lower complier subgroups. In T, higher compliers showed more improvement at 6 weeks than lower compliers in: delta PC20 (533.3 versus 67.8%, P less than .05), delta FEV1 (8.7 versus -1.7%, P less than .01), and delta FEF25-75% (31.9 versus 1.1%, P less than .01). These data suggest that triamcinolone improves bronchial hyperreactivity as well as airways obstruction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Safety of Frequent_HP high dose nebulized terbutaline in children with Status_asthmaticus_HP.Forty-four Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) admissions for Status_asthmaticus_HP in 27 children between 8/80 and 10/86 were reviewed to determine the safety of Prolonged_HP administration of Frequent_HPly nebulized terbutaline. The mean dose of nebulized terbutaline was 0.2 mg/kg/dose (range = 0.1 to 0.4 mg/kg/dose) given at a mean Frequency_HP of 2.4 +/- 1.2 hours. Seven patients received continuous nebulization at a dose of 0.4 +/- 0.2 mg/kg/h. All patients were placed on continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring. Emergency room therapy was determined by the primary emergency room physicians. Upon admission to the PICU, the mean +/- SD heart rate was 150 +/- 21 bpm and the respiratory rate was 44 +/- 16 bpm. After institution of therapy, these parameters decreased to a similar degree in parallel. The maximum decrease after 36 hours was 28% and 37% for heart rate and respiratory rate, respectively. No Arrhythmia_HP were noted. The initial PaCO2 upon admission to the PICU was 32 mm Hg (range = 24 to 44 mm Hg), the maximum decrease in PaCO2 generally occurred during the 6-hour to 12-hour time interval following admission. We conclude that Frequent_HP administration of high doses of nebulized terbutaline is safe in the management of Acute_HP Severe_HP childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP even in the setting of Prolonged_HP administration to the hospitalized child.

Dose-response effects of two sizes of monodisperse isoproterenol in Mild_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The dose-response effect of monodispersed isoproterenol of two different sizes (diameters 2.5 and 5 microns) was examined in eight Mild_HP asthmatic subjects (baseline FEV, 81.5% of predicted). Pulmonary and cardiovascular variables were measured before and following 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 cumulative min of aerosol inhalation. Subjects inhaled 1 to 30 micrograms (2.5-microns particles) or 2 to 50 micrograms (5-microns particles) of isoproterenol. Pulmonary but not cardiac responses were significantly greater for the 2.5-microns particles as compared to equivalent doses of 5-microns particles. Pulmonary dose-related response differences were particularly marked for variables associated with small airway function (FEF25-75 and FEF75-85). These findings suggest that small particles penetrate more deeply into the lung and thereby more effectively dilate small airways and that small amounts of appropriately sized inhaled bronchodilator may produce considerable therapeutic effects.

Prior exposure to ozone potentiates subsequent response to sulfur dioxide in adolescent asthmatic subjects.The objective of this study was to test whether prior exposure to a low concentration of ozone (120 ppb) would condition airways in asthmatic subjects to respond to a subthreshold concentration of sulfur dioxide (100 ppb). Eight male and five female subjects 12 to 18 yr of age participated. They all had allergic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and exercise-induced Bronchospasm_HP. Subjects were exposed to three test atmosphere sequences during Recurrent_HP Moderate_HP exercise (a 45-min exposure to one pollutant followed by a 15-min exposure to the second pollutant). The sequences were: air followed by 100 ppb SO2, 120 ppb O3 followed by 120 ppb O3, and 120 ppb O3 followed by 100 ppb SO2. The pulmonary function measurements assessed were FEV1, total respiratory resistance (RT), and maximal flow (Vmax50). Air-SO2 and O3-O3 Exposures_ASDPTO did not cause significant changes in pulmonary function. On the other hand, exposure to 100 ppb SO2 after a 45-min exposure to 120 ppb O3 caused a significant (8%) decrease in FEV1 (p = 0.046), a significant (19%) increase in RT (p = 0.048), and a significant (15%) decrease in Vmax50 (p = 0.008). It is concluded that prior O3 exposure increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness in these subjects such that they responded to an ordinarily subthreshold concentration of SO2. These data suggest that assessment of pulmonary changes to single pollutant challenges overlooks the interactive effects of common coexisting or sequentially occurring air pollutants.

Short-term exposure to 0.3 ppm nitrogen dioxide does not potentiate airway responsiveness to sulfur dioxide in asthmatic subjects.Whether short-term exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) enhances airway responsiveness in asthmatic subjects is controversial. Because it is well established that Asthma_ASDPTO_HP is associated with increased airway responsiveness to another common air pollutant, sulfur dioxide (SO2), we examined whether short-term exposure of asthmatic subjects to 0.3 ppm NO2 potentiates airway responsiveness to inhaled SO2. We exposed nine subjects with clinically Stable_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP to 0.3 ppm NO2 or filtered air in an environmental room for 30 min on 2 separate days at least 1 wk apart in a double-blind, randomized fashion. A questionnaire about common symptoms related to inhaled irritants was completed before and immediately after each exposure. Each subject exercised (60 to 80 W) on a cycloergometer during the first 20 min of each exposure. We measured specific airway resistance (SRaw) and FEV1/FVC before, 5 min after, and 1 h after completion of the air or NO2 exposure. The single-breath nitrogen test (SBN2) was also performed before and 1 h after completion of the air or NO2 Exposures_ASDPTO and closing volume was determined; subsequently, SO2 dose-response curves (0.25 to 4.0 ppm) were performed via a mouthpiece. Each dose of SO2 was inhaled at a minute ventilation of 20 L/min for 4 min and was doubled until SRaw increased by at least 8 U above baseline. The dose of SO2 required to provoke an increase in SRaw of 8 U above baseline was determined by linear interpolation from the dose-response curve (PD8Uso2).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Acute_HP topical steroid administration blocks mast cell increase and the late asthmatic response of the canine Peripheral_HP airways.Previous studies indicated that mast cell number increased after airway exposure to Ascaris suum antigen (Ag). The following two series of experiments were performed to test the hypothesis that this phenomenon may be associated with the Ag-induced late-phase bronchoconstriction (LAR). In the first, two bronchoscopes wedged in airway segments of two contralateral lobes of 16 dogs were used to deliver 0.26, 2.6, or 26 micrograms of Ag to one lobe; the other served as a control. After the observation of a LAR, Ag and control lobes plus one unexposed tissue sample were collected and prepared for histologic examination. The data showed that the incidence, time of Onset_HP, and magnitude of the LAR were dose-related. In the second series of experiments, performed in 14 dogs, the tracheal mucosal surface was surgically exposed to allow 80 micrograms of beclomethasone dipropionate to be sprayed on one half while the other half was Left_HP untreated. Pledgets saturated with 0.2 microgram of Ag were placed on both sides 1 h later. Then two bronchoscopes were used to pretreat airways of two contralateral lobes to 40 micrograms of either the steroid or the vehicle. One hour later, both airways were exposed to 2.6 micrograms of aerosolized Ag. Of these 14 dogs monitored for Peripheral_HP airway responses, seven demonstrated a LAR in the vehicle-treated airway. In all seven dogs, the LAR was absent in the steroid-treated airway even though the cellular profiles of the two airways did not significantly differ. In seven additional dogs, the bronchoscopic procedure was performed as previously described. However, these dogs were killed 1 h after Ag exposure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Acute_HP topical steroid administration blocks mast cell increase and the late asthmatic response of the canine peripheral airways.Previous studies indicated that mast cell number increased after airway exposure to Ascaris suum antigen (Ag). The following two series of experiments were performed to test the hypothesis that this phenomenon may be associated with the Ag-induced late-phase bronchoconstriction (LAR). In the first, two bronchoscopes wedged in airway segments of two contralateral lobes of 16 dogs were used to deliver 0.26, 2.6, or 26 micrograms of Ag to one lobe; the other served as a control. After the observation of a LAR, Ag and control lobes plus one unexposed tissue sample were collected and prepared for histologic examination. The data showed that the incidence, time of onset, and magnitude of the LAR were dose-related. In the second series of experiments, performed in 14 dogs, the tracheal mucosal surface was surgically exposed to allow 80 micrograms of beclomethasone dipropionate to be sprayed on one half while the other half was left untreated.

Massive theophylline overdose with atypical metabolic abnormalities.We report a case of fatal theophylline overdose in a 16-year-old asthmatic boy who presented with Seizures_ASDPTO_HP, Respiratory_arrest_HP, and a theophylline concentration of 117 mg/L in serum. His hospital course was complicated by Refractory_HP Hypotension_HP and Severe_HP ischemic necrosis of skeletal muscle, bowel, and liver. The metabolic abnormalities observed early in his hospital course included Severe_HP Hyperkalemia_HP, Hyperphosphatemia_HP, Hypermagnesemia_HP, Hypocalcemia_HP, and Profound_HP Metabolic_Acidosis_HP. These metabolic abnormalities differ from those previously reported in cases of massive theophylline overdose. The metabolic abnormalities observed in this patient probably reflected his extensive ischemic tissue damage with release of intracellular ions and associated Acidosis_HP. Markedly increased catalytic activities of creatine kinase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase in serum were also noted.

Strain differences in guinea pigs' bronchial sensitivity to acetylcholine.The bronchial sensitivity to acetylcholine (ACh) of guinea pigs of various strains was investigated to clarify strain differences. Inbred Strain 2, Strain 13 and JY-1 and non-inbred Hartley strain (two colonies) were used in this experiment. (1) Guinea pigs were exposed to 0.08% ACh aerosol and the time needed to produce falling down (TNPFD) was determined. Mean +/- standard error of TNPFD (n = 14 per group) of animals was 182 +/- 28 sec, 148 +/- 22 sec, 210 +/- 30 sec, 342 +/- 24 sec and 406 +/- 36 sec in Strain 2, Strain 13, JY-1, Hartley (Japan SLC) and Hartley (Hitachi), respectively. There was a significant difference in TNPFD between inbred strains and non-inbred strains (P less than 0.05 or P less than 0.01), indicating that inbred strains had higher sensitivity. (2) Guinea pigs were exposed to 20-5000 micrograms/ml ACh for 2 min. The mean dose threshold as determined by transcutaneous oxygen pressure was 524 micrograms/ml, 424 micrograms/ml, 614 micrograms/ml, 1317 micrograms/ml and 1651 micrograms/ml (n = 14 per group) in Strain 2, Strain 13, JY-1, Hartley (Japan SLC) and Hartley (Hitachi), respectively. Inbred strains showed lower dose thresholds than non-inbred strains. (3) Isolated trachea-lungs of 5 guinea pigs were perfused with 10(-9)-10(-5) g/ml ACh to determine strain differences. Dose response curves of animals of inbred strains shifted to the Left_HP (lower concentrations), unlike those of non-inbred strains, suggesting that inbred strains had higher sensitivity to ACh than non-inbred strains.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

[Inhibitory effects of OKY-046.HCl, a selective thromboxane (TX) A2 synthetase inhibitor, on platelet activating factor (PAF)-induced airway hyperresponsiveness in guinea pigs].We studied the inhibitory effects of OKY-046.HCl on PAF-induced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in guinea pigs. 1) Inhalation of PAF (1 or 10 micrograms/ml) caused AHR to acetylcholine (ACh) aerosol and increased TXB2 generation in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) at 30 min and 60 min, but the AHR and the TXB2 generation disappeared at 2 hr. OKY-046.HCl (100 mg/kg, intraduodenally) inhibited the AHR, which was accompanied by its inhibition of the TXB2 generation. However, no changes of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha in BALF were found. 2) There were no changes in the number of leukocytes; the activities of alkaline phosphatase, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, and lactate dehydrogenase; and the LTC4/D4/E4 in BALF. 3) In bronchus-lung preparations, PAF (1 microgram/min) also caused the AHR and increased TXB2 generation. OKY-046.HCl (100 micrograms/min) inhibited the AHR and TXB2 generation. 4) PAF (1 microgram/ml) evoked TXB2 generation in BALF from normal guinea pigs. OKY-046.HCl (10(-4)M) inhibited its increase. 5) Stable_HP TXA2 (STA2, 1 ng/ml) inhalation also caused AHR to ACh at 30 min. STA2 (0.45 ng/min) also caused the AHR in bronchus-lung preparations. These results suggest that OKY-046.HCl can inhibit PAF-induced AHR by suppressing the generation of TXA2. We also supposed that TXA2 is released from lung parenchyma, airway epithelium and cell components in BALF.

Problems in defining normal limits for serum IgE.Recommended "normal limits" for serum IgE generally assume that a single upper limit of normal can be applied to all adults. The present article describes the distribution of IgE levels in 2657 subjects in a general population sample in Tucson, Ariz. Limits of IgE defining the lower 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, and 95% in 1569 subjects with negative Allergy_HP skin tests and without current Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, considered a reference group, are provided by age and sex. These cutoffs are then used to compare groups with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and with positive Allergy_HP skin tests with the reference population. Distributions of IgE levels in these groups are vastly different, but defining an upper "limit of normal" for serum IgE is of doubtful clinical value because there is no single level of IgE that distinguishes different groups with any precision. The spread of IgE values is extremely wide in subjects with and without known allergic diseases.

Bronchial reactivity and atopy in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP discordant monozygotic twins.Bronchial reactivity was studied in six Asthma_ASDPTO_HP-discordant monozygotic twin pairs. In four pairs, atopy was confirmed in the asthmatic twin. It was not confirmed in any of the nonasthmatics. In five pairs, the asthmatic twin was markedly more reactive than the nonasthmatic partner. Bronchial reactivity correlated significantly with total IgE. The results indicate that hyperreactivity and atopy were acquired.

Continuous nebulization of albuterol (salbutamol) in Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.We studied the safety and efficacy of albuterol (salbutamol) delivered by continuous nebulization (CN) in the initial emergency department treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. In a randomized fashion 21 patients received 5 mg of albuterol by bolus nebulization (BN) at time 0 and again 60 minutes later. Twenty-one others received albuterol (0.2 mg/ml) by CN using a calibrated nebulizer with a known output of 25 ml/h. Thus, each patient had received 10 mg of albuterol over two hours. FEV1, blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and Hand_Tremor_HP were recorded at 30-minute intervals. The FEV1 was 1.48 +/- 0.64 L prior to BN and increased to a maximum of 2.20 +/- 0.94 L (p less than 0.05) 90 minutes later. The FEV1 prior to CN was 1.13 +/- 0.51 L and improved to 2.20 +/- 1.02 L (p less than 0.05) at 120 minutes. The FEV1 did not differ significantly between regimens over the 2-hour period. Both modes of therapy were well tolerated. There was a slight but significant increase in HR at 30 and 90 minutes in the BN group when compared with CN. There was no significant difference in BP, RR, or Tremor_HP between the groups. Thus, albuterol by CN was found to be equally effective as the same medication by BN in the early treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in patients seen in the emergency department.

Isoflurane therapy for Status_asthmaticus_HP in children and adults.Two adults and two children with life-threatening Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Refractory_HP to maximal standard therapy were treated with the inhalational anesthetic agent isoflurane. In each case, the temporal response to the initiation of therapy was striking. All patients survived and none experienced adverse reactions attributable to the drug. Rapid therapeutic benefit, minimal side effects, absence of cumulative toxicity, and ease of administration are factors supporting the use of isoflurane for patients with Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Members of the alpha-amylase inhibitors family from wheat endosperm are major allergens associated with baker's Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.We have identified the major antigens or IgE binding components from wheat flour. Thirty-five sera from patients with baker's Asthma_ASDPTO_HP were used to analyze the reaction with wheat salt-soluble proteins. We found a 15 kDa SDS-PAGE band which reacted with all sera tested. Purified members of the alpha-amylase inhibitor family, which are the main components of the 15 kDa band, were recognized by specific IgE when tested with a pool of reactive sera. Immunodetection after two-dimensional electrophoretic fractionation of crude inhibitor preparations from wheat endosperms also detected several inhibitor subunits as major low-molecular-weight allergens.

Effect of verapamil inhalation on Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The effect of inhaled verapamil 20 mg on pulmonary functions and arterial blood gases in 15 patients with extrinsic Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was studied in single-blind fashion. A significant decrease (p less than 0.05) in airway resistance and a significant increase (p less than 0.01) in specific conductance was observed after verapamil inhalation. A small increase (p less than 0.1) was observed in forced vital capacity and peak expiratory flow rate after verapamil inhalation; however, this was not statistically significant. None of the parameters of pulmonary function tests showed a significant change after normal saline inhalation. A significant fall in PaO2 (p less than 0.05) and PaCO2 (p less than 0.05) was noted after normal saline inhalation. PaCO2 showed a significant fall (p less than 0.01) after verapamil inhalation. Alveolar arterial oxygen gradient P(A-a)O2 widened significantly (p less than 0.001) after normal saline inhalation. A larger dose (20 mg) of verapamil inhalation produces a significant bronchodilator effect on large airways, but does not produce a significant change in arterial oxygen tension from the baseline value in patients with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Description of a delivery method for continuously aerosolized albuterol in Status_asthmaticus_HP.The use of continuously nebulized beta agonists may be considered in the treatment of Status_asthmaticus_HP, particularly when conventional therapy is failing. Methods of administration of continuously nebulized beta agonists may be cumbersome. We describe a delivery method which allowed simplification of this process, yielded accurate delivery of a specified dose of albuterol, and was beneficial in a reported case of Status_asthmaticus_HP.

Tracheal_stenosis_HP caused by congenital Vascular_ring_HP anomaly misinterpreted as Asthma_ASDPTO_HP for 45 years.Dyspnoeic conditions simulating Asthma_ASDPTO_HP are not uncommon in adult and paediatric practice. Vascular_ring_HP anomalies in particular may be misdiagnosed, resulting in unnecessary delay before corrective surgery. We report a rare case of symptomatic Double_aortic_arch_HP in an adult which emphasises the above points.

Evaluation of a capsulated hydrophilic carrier polymer (the ImmunoCAP) for measurement of specific IgE antibodies.The Pharmacia CAP System is a new assay for serum specific IgE, utilising a solid phase capable of binding more antigen than conventional systems. The CAP System has been evaluated in 69 consecutive patients referred to one Allergy_HP clinic in relation to skin prick test (SPT), radioallergosorbent test (Phadebas RAST) and specific Allergy_HP Diagnosis_ASDPTO for five inhalant allergens, D.pteronyssinus, timothy grass pollen, cat epithelium/dander, Cladosporium and Alternaria. Good correlation was obtained between RAST and CAP for all allergens, e.g. r = 0.974 for D.pteronyssinus and r = 0.964 for grass pollen. When sensitivity and specificity were examined for both CAP and RAST versus SPT, CAP was usually found to be of greater sensitivity than RAST, and of similar or slightly lower specificity. SPT gave more positive reactions than either in vitro test, but CAP gave more positives than RAST. Twenty-two of 336 (6.6%) tests were CAP positive/RAST negative, whereas a negative CAP with a positive RAST occurred in only 2/336 (0.6%) tests. Of patients with any test (SPT or RAST or CAP) for specific IgE positive, up to 20-30% did not have clinical Allergy_HP, confirming the importance of the history in interpreting these tests. Our results suggest that, for the allergens tested, the Pharmacia CAP System is more sensitive than the RAST, identifying more positive tests and approximating more closely to the SPT.

The CAP System has been evaluated in 69 consecutive patients referred to one allergy clinic in relation to skin prick test (SPT), radioallergosorbent test (Phadebas RAST) and specific allergy diagnosis for five inhalant allergens, D.pteronyssinus, timothy grass pollen, cat epithelium/dander, Cladosporium and Alternaria. Good correlation was obtained between RAST and CAP for all allergens, e.g. r = 0.974 for D.pteronyssinus and r = 0.964 for grass pollen. When sensitivity and specificity were examined for both CAP and RAST versus SPT, CAP was usually found to be of greater sensitivity than RAST, and of similar or slightly lower specificity. SPT gave more positive reactions than either in vitro test, but CAP gave more positives than RAST. Twenty-two of 336 (6.6%) tests were CAP positive/RAST negative, whereas a negative CAP with a positive RAST occurred in only 2/336 (0.6%) tests. Of patients with any test (SPT or RAST or CAP) for specific IgE positive, up to 20-30% did not have clinical allergy, confirming the importance of the history in interpreting these tests. Our results suggest that, for the allergens tested, the Pharmacia CAP System is more sensitive than the RAST, identifying more positive tests and approximating more closely to the SPT. It offers the additional advantages of speed and efficiency.
Predictive value of monitoring expiratory peak flow rates in hospitalized adult Asthma_ASDPTO_HP patients.This prospective single-blind study monitored the progress and outcome of 18 hospitalized asthmatic patients on intravenous corticosteroids by daily peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) measurements to determine whether daily flow monitoring was useful as a guide for predicting response to therapy over the short- and long-term course posthospitalization. Daily monitoring of PEFR was helpful in demonstrating the response to therapy during hospitalization and at follow-up visit (1 to 2 weeks) posthospitalization. This change in PEFR during Acute_HP hospitalization and at initial follow-up visit did not correlate well with relapse or repeat hospitalization during the 5- to 17-month follow-up period.

Abnormalities in airway smooth muscle in fatal Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.The characteristics of asthmatic airway smooth muscle are poorly described. Using standard organ bath techniques, the in vitro isometric contractile and relaxant responses of tracheal strips obtained from seven asthmatics (A) (mean age, 48 +/- 6 SEM yr) dying during Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP attacks outside hospital were studied 7.6 +/- 1.3 h after death. Drug therapy had varied, but it had always included inhaled beta 2-agonists. Control data (C) were obtained from 31 subjects (54 +/- 2 yr) studied 9.5 +/- 0.4 h after sudden nonrespiratory death. Cholinergic contractile and nonadrenergic noncholinergic inhibitory (NANCI) neural responses were studied with electrical field stimulation (EFS); histamine, isoproterenol (ISO), and theophylline (THEO) responses were studied using cumulative techniques. The maximal response (Tmax, g/g tissue) to histamine, cholinergic EFS (A = 61.3 +/- 13.2, C = 33.6 +/- 3.6, p less than 0.0001), (A = 70.3 +/- 11.8, C = 47.3 +/- 4.5, p = 0.041), and acetylcholine (ACh) (A = 101.9 +/- 17.4, C = 62.7 +/- 7.5, p = 0.012) was greater in the asthmatics but NANCI responses were similar. Cholinergic Tmax (EFS) as a percentage of Tmax (ACh), EC50 (histamine), and EF50 (EFS) were similar in the two groups. With tissues contracted to 60% of maximum with histamine, the concentrations of ISO (A = 60.3 nM, C = 12.7, p = 0.01) and THEO (A = 31.9 microM, C = 5.7, p = 0.041) to reduce tension by 50% (IC50) were greater in asthmatics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Pulmonary gas exchange in Severe_HP Chronic_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Response to 100% oxygen and salbutamol.Ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) inequality has been evaluated using the multiple inert gas technique in nine nonsmoking patients (mean +/- SD, age 56 +/- 10 yr) with Stable_HP, Severe_HP, Chronic_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (partially reversible airway obstruction; baseline FEV1, 39 +/- 10% predicted) before and during 100% O2 breathing and then 15 min after three puffs (300 micrograms) of inhaled salbutamol. The aim of this study was to investigate whether this type of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP was associated with a different pattern of VA/Q inequality from that observed in Acute_HP episodes and in particular to determine whether the VA/Q pattern was fixed or could be altered by bronchodilator agents or O2 breathing. The predominant pattern of VA/Q distribution was broad and unimodal but without shunt (VA/Q = 0) or low VA/Q areas (VA/Q less than 0.1 to greater than 0.005). The amount of VA/Q inequality as assessed by the dispersion of the distribution of pulmonary bloodflow (log SDQ) was not great (log SDQ, 0.77 +/- 0.09), and no correlation was found with the degree of airway obstruction, PaO2 or AaPO2. During 100% O2 breathing, VA/Q inequality worsened (from log SDQ of 0.77 +/- 0.09 to 1.11 +/- 0.21, p = 0.01) with an increase in the perfusion of low VA/Q units (from 0.43 +/- 0.66% to 6.3 +/- 6.5%, p = 0.02) but still no development of shunt. This suggests the presence of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction breathing air, possibly contributing to the preservation of VA/Q relationships.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

The prevalence of allergic disease and IgE antibodies to house dust mite in schoolchildren in Taiwan.The prevalence of positive specific IgE antibodies to house dust mites (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus; D. farinae) was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 5097 (61%) volunteers of 8345 schoolchildren aged between 7 and 14 yr from two government schools. All of them filled out a questionnaire concerning allergic symptoms. Among them, 412 (8.1%) children showed a positive reaction to at least one of the two mite allergens, the range varying between 5.6 and 11.2% according to the child's age. Boys had higher prevalence of positive mite specific IgE than girls (9.8% vs. 6.4%, P less than 0.01), with the overall male to female ratio 1.5:1. The prevalence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in boys and girls was 5.3% and 3.3% respectively. The positive mite specific IgE antibody in children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Allergic_Rhinitis_HP was 52% (103 of 198) and 28.7% (193 of 673) respectively. The mean levels of mite specific IgE were not significantly related to the Onset_HP and Severity_HP of Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic symptoms (P greater than 0.1), but were significantly different among subjects with current and past Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (P less than 0.001). It is suggested that the mite-specific IgE may play a role in the pathogenesis of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in children.

The positive mite specific IgE antibody in children with asthma and allergic rhinitis was 52% (103 of 198) and 28.7% (193 of 673) respectively. The mean levels of mite specific IgE were not significantly related to the age of onset and severity of asthmatic symptoms (P greater than 0.1), but were significantly different among subjects with current and past asthma (P less than 0.001).

Development of serum Dermatophagoides farinae-, ovalbumin- and lactalbumin-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG4, IgA and IgM in children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP/Allergic_Rhinitis_HP or Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP.Dermatophagoides farinae-, ovalbumin- and lactalbumin-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG4, IgA and IgM were evaluated in 161 Healthy_HP children [Group 1], 84 children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and/or Allergic_Rhinitis_HP but without Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP [Group 2], and 54 children with Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP but without Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Allergic_Rhinitis_HP [Group 3]. We also studied D. farinae-, egg-white-, and milk-specific IgE of children with allergic diseases. D. farinae-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG4 and IgA in Groups 2 and 3 increased until 5 years of age and thereafter they remained constant. After 2 years of age, D. farinae-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG4 and IgA in Group 2 were higher than those in Groups 1 and 3. Ovalbumin- and lactalbumin-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG4 and IgA in Groups 2 and 3 increased until 1 year of age and thereafter decreased. Until 1 year of age, ovalbumin- and lactalbumin-specific IgG, IgG1 and IgG4 in Groups 3 were higher than those in Groups 1 and 2. D. farinae-, ovalbumin- and lactalbumin-specific IgM were constant in all ages of all groups. These results suggest that Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP in young children is related to food-specific immunoglobulins and that respiratory allergic diseases in older children is related to D. farinae-specific immunoglobulins.
Development of serum Dermatophagoides farinae-, ovalbumin- and lactalbumin-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG4, IgA and IgM in children with bronchial asthma/allergic rhinitis or atopic dermatitis.Dermatophagoides farinae-, ovalbumin- and lactalbumin-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG4, IgA and IgM were evaluated in 161 healthy children [Group 1], 84 children with bronchial asthma and/or allergic rhinitis but without atopic dermatitis [Group 2], and 54 children with atopic dermatitis but without bronchial asthma and allergic rhinitis [Group 3].

Shared and specific allergenic and antigenic components in the two sexes of American cockroach--Periplaneta americana.The whole body extracts (WBEs) of female and male cockroaches (Periplaneta americana; Pa) were prepared separately to study the specific and/or shared allergenic and antigenic components in the two sexes. These two extracts were skin-tested on 170 respiratory Allergy_HP patients and 52 (30.6%) of them elicited a markedly positive cutaneous reaction (2+ to 4+) to any one or both the WBEs. Of these 52 patients, 32 (61.5%) produced a 2+ to 4+ response to only one, and the remaining 20 (38.5%) to both the extracts. In female and male RASTs to Pa both the extracts produced dose-related inhibition. Using rabbit anti-Pa female serum: (1) immuno-diffusion experiments resulted in lines of identity with the two extracts, and (2) the two-dimensional immunoelectrophoresis of Pa female and Pa male WBEs elicited 12 and nine precipitin peaks, respectively. In partial purification studies, only fraction Pa(F)III (approximately 50 kD) of Pa female WBE and Pa(M)I (greater than or equal to 600 kD) and Pa(M)III (approximately 50 kD) fractions of Pa male WBE revealed significant allergen activity both on skin testing and also in RAST inhibition studies. These results provide evidence for the presence of shared as well as specific allergenic and antigenic components in the two sexes of American cockroach.

The bronchodilator response from increasing doses of terbutaline inhaled from a multi-dose powder inhaler (Turbuhaler).Twelve adult asthmatics inhaled single doses of 0.5, 2.0 or 4.0 mg of terbutaline, respectively, via Turbuhaler, on three separate days. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and pulse rate were measured 15, 30, 45 and 60 min after inhalation from the inhaler and then hourly up to 8 h. The results showed that a more rapid Onset_HP of action, a greater maximal response and a longer duration of action can be achieved by exceeding the standard dose of terbutaline of 0.5 mg. The incidence of adverse effects was very low even at the highest dose, 4 mg. This study emphasizes the need for individual dosing of inhaled bronchodilators.

Comparison between theophylline and an adenosine non-blocking xanthine in Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.Enprofylline, a drug without adenosine antagonism and theophylline, a potent adenosine antagonist, were compared, double-blind, randomized, in Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP (n = 33). The drugs were given intravenously as loading over 10 min followed by maintenance infusion for 24 h. Mean final plasma levels were very high with enprofylline (14 mg.l), and larger than calculated with theophylline (16 mg.l). Seven patients had maximum levels of enprofylline ranging between 16 and 42 mg.l. Extreme plasma levels of enprofylline were not associated with any theophylline-like Central_HP nervous system excitatory effects related to Seizures_HP-inducing ability. Some irregularities in the heart rhythm did not raise clinical problems and no significant difference between enprofylline and theophylline was recorded. At 1 h patients on enprofylline (mean plasma level: 5.7 mg.l) and theophylline (12.2 mg.l) had improved their peak expiratory flow rates by 31% and 15% (p less than 0.05), respectively. The improvement in lung function after 24 hours did not differ between treatments suggesting that the high levels of enprofylline were supramaximal for its anti-Asthma_ASDPTO_HP effects in this situation. In conclusion, with enprofylline it is demonstrated that an adenosine non-blocking xanthine derivative may lack CNS-excitatory effects, but be more potent than theophylline in the treatment of Acute_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

Education of adult patients at an "Asthma_ASDPTO_HP school": effects on quality of life, knowledge and need for nursing.The effect of education of adult Asthma_ASDPTO_HP patients at a special "Asthma_ASDPTO_HP school" was studied with regard to knowledge of the disease and its treatment and quality of life measured by leisure activities, social interaction and psychological well being. We also studied if there were any differences in number of days in hospital and emergency visits before and one year after the Asthma_ASDPTO_HP-school. Patients were randomised to an intervention group (7 men and 13 women) and a control group (7 men and 11 women). The age-range was 22-66 yrs. Both groups answered the same standardized and quantified questionnaires on three occasions, before the start of the Asthma_ASDPTO_HP school, after five months and after twelve months. Both groups increased their knowledge of the disease and how to treat it, with slightly better results in the intervention group. The self-assessments all showed that patients in the intervention group felt better than those in the control group. The number of days in hospital as well as Acute_HP visits to out patients clinics were reduced significantly after the Asthma_ASDPTO_HP school. The intervention did not influence spirometric variables.

Airways response of asthmatics after a 30 min exposure, at resting ventilation, to 0.25 ppm NO2 or 0.5 ppm SO2.We compared the effect of inhaled NO2 and SO2 on airway tone and airway responsiveness in 14 nonsmoking Mild_HP asthmatics (mean +/- SD age 34 +/- 14 yrs; mean +/- SD baseline forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), 86 +/- 17% pred). On 3 separate days, 30 min tidal breathing (average minute ventilation 10.6 l.min-1) of either filtered air, 0.25 ppm NO2, or 0.5 ppm SO2 was followed by an isocapnic Hyperventilation_HP test with 0.75 ppm SO2. To determine the provocative ventilation necessary to increase specific airway resistance (sRaw) by 100% (PV100sRaw) ventilation was increased in steps of 15 l.min-1, each step lasting 3 min. Resting ventilation of filtered air, NO2, or SO2 was followed by a slight but significant overall decrease of sRaw from 8.8 to 7.7 cmH20.s-1, with no differences between the study days. Mean +/- SEM PV100sRaw(SO2) was 46.5 +/- 5.1, 37.7 +/- 3.5 and 45.4 +/- 4.2 l.min-1 after tidal breathing of filtered air, NO2, and SO2, respectively. PV100sRaw(SO2) was significantly lower after NO2 as compared to filtered air or SO2 (p less than 0.01). There was a significant correlation (rs = 0.86) between the individual shift of PV100sRaw(SO2) after NO2 and the shift after SO2 as compared to filtered air. From these individual comparisons we suggest that in asthmatics short-term exposure to NO2 at rest enhances airway responsiveness to Hyperventilation_HP of SO2 without altering airway tone, whereas short-term exposure with low concentrations of SO2 does not.

RAST and PRIST in children with Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP.The study was carried out in 535 children. The Frequency_HP of positive RAST for food allergens decreased with age, whereas the Frequency_HP of positive RAST for inhalant allergens increased with age. Coexistence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and/or Rhinitis_HP was not related to the results of RAST with food allergens. Positive RAST and multiple sensitivity for inhalant allergens were significantly greater in children with coexistence atopic respiratory disease. Total IgE was significantly higher in children with coexistent atopic respiratory disease in all age groups. This study provides information for the critical analysis of a RAST in Atopic_Inflammatory_abnormality_of_the_skin_HP.

Coexistence of asthma and/or rhinitis was not related to the results of RAST with food allergens. Positive RAST and multiple sensitivity for inhalant allergens were significantly greater in children with coexistence atopic respiratory disease. Total IgE was significantly higher in children with coexistent atopic respiratory disease in all age groups. This study provides information for the critical analysis of a RAST in atopic dermatitis.
Effects of increasing doses of beta-agonists on airway and parenchymal hysteresis.We examined the effects of a deep inhalation on airway caliber before and after increasing doses of a beta-agonist in eight subjects, including one former and two current but Mild_HP asthmatics. With bronchodilation the increase in maximal flow on the partial flow-volume curve (P), initiated from functional residual capacity, exceeded that seen on the maximal curve (M), initiated from total lung capacity, such that isovolumic maximal flows diminished after a deep inhalation; i.e., M/P ratios fell with bronchodilation, as we and others have found. Five of eight reversed this downward trend in M/P ratios at higher cumulative doses. Quasistatic pressure-volume curves (QSPV) were simultaneously performed on two of these five and demonstrated a decrease in pressure-volume hysteresis (PVH) at the higher doses associated with a rising M/P ratio. Three of eight had continuing low and diminishing M/P ratio up to the highest dose given. QSPV were performed in two of these three and indicated no change in PVH at any of the doses. One of these two had a repeat study using a subcutaneous beta-agonist after the inhaled drug was given, and the M/P ratio rose as QSPV PVH fell. These data support the relative hysteresis analysis of airway and parenchyma as an explanation for volume history effects on airway caliber.

Atopy in subjects with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP followed to the age of 28 years.The relationship between markers of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and atopy was examined in 323 subjects at the age of 28 years who have been followed since the age of 7 years. Allergic_rhinitis_HP was common in all groups with Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, increasing from 25% of the control group to 67% of the group with the most Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, class V. Eczema_HP was uncommon at this age in all groups. IgE levels, Peripheral_HP blood eosinophil counts, and skin reactions were significantly (p less than 0.05) higher in class V than in the control group. Increasing age was associated with a Progressive_HP fall in eosinophil counts and an increase in skin reactivity to common allergens. No change in IgE levels was observed from 21 to 28 years. A general relationship between bronchial hyperreactivity and atopic markers was found. However, only the occurrence of Allergic_rhinitis_HP was significantly related to reactivity when account was taken of Severity_HP of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The results indicate that the relationship between Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and atopy observed at earlier reviews continues into adult life and that bronchial hyperreactivity and atopy are not directly linked.
Atopy in subjects with asthma followed to the age of 28 years.The relationship between markers of asthma and atopy was examined in 323 subjects at the age of 28 years who have been followed since the age of 7 years.

Occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP caused by latex in a surgical glove manufacturing plant.A 33-year-old latex glove inspector was diagnosed as having occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP on the basis of peak flow and methacholine-responsiveness changes related to workplace exposure. She had latex sensitivity by skin prick testing. This finding led to a survey of her workplace. Of the 81 workers, 84% completed a questionnaire to assess work-related respiratory symptoms, 79% underwent skin prick testing to latex and six other workplace chemicals, and 62% performed workshift spirometry. Seven workers had spirometric changes consistent with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, of whom five had greater than or equal to 15% fall in FEV1 during the workshift. Six of these workers underwent methacholine-challenge testing, and three were found to have a significant improvement in responsiveness to methacholine away from work, suggestive of occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Two of these workers had positive skin test responses to latex. Including the index case, 6% of workers who had pulmonary function testing had findings of latex-related occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Skin test responses to latex occurred in 11% of workers tested. Our findings suggest that latex should be considered among the causes of occupational Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.

[Bamifylline in the therapy of Asthma_ASDPTO_HPtic syndromes. Efficacy and side effects vs delayed-action theophylline anhydride].Two homogeneous groups of 8 patients suffering from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP or Chronic_HP obstructive bronchial Pneumonia_HP were treated with slow release theophylline anhydride or bamiphylline respectively, both products being given orally twice a day. The results showed that both drugs possess a powerful bronchodilatory action and therefore have a beneficial effect on subjective symptoms. Statistical analysis confirmed the absence of any significant difference between the two xanthine derivatives, both of which were well-tolerated though bamiphylline offered a slight advantage in this respect. In fact there were no side effects at all in the bamiphylline group whereas there was one case of Moderate_HP gastric intolerance in the group given theophylline anhydride, though it was not Severe_HP enough to warrant suspension of the treatment or reduction of the dose.

[Mononuclear cell activation in Status_asthmaticus_HP].Evidence was provided by the authors, that the activity of circulating mononuclear cells is increased in Status_asthmaticus_HP. An increased spontaneous secretion of chemotactic cytokin was found into the culture medium. There was no further increase in neutrophil chemotactic activity after 24 hours. In all patients a reduction was observed in the amount of neutrophil chemotactic activity after one week therapy, which is probably due to steroid treatment. No eosinophil chemotactic activity could be detected in the mononuclear cell supernatant derived from patients with Status_asthmaticus_HP. The chemotactic activity was measured using a 48-well microchemotactic chamber. This mononuclear cell derived cytokin may play a role in genesis of asthmatic bronchial inflammation and provides further evidence that mononuclear cell activation is a feature of Status_asthmaticus_HP.

Maternal Smoking_ASDPTO and childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP.According to a substantial literature, passive Smoking_ASDPTO by children is associated with an increased incidence of lower respiratory illness and diminished pulmonary function. The relationship between passive Smoking_ASDPTO and childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, however, is not clear. Data from the Child Health Supplement to the 1981 National Health Interview Survey were analyzed with information about 4331 children aged 0 to 5 years to study the relationship between maternal Smoking_ASDPTO and (1) the prevalence of childhood Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, (1) the likelihood of taking Asthma_ASDPTO_HP medication, (3) the Onset_HP of children's Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, and (4) the number of Hospitalizations_ASDPTO among children with and without Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. An odds ratio for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP of 2.1 was shown by multivariate logistic regressions among children whose mothers smoke 0.5 packs of cigarettes or more per day compared with children of nonsmokers (P = .001). In similar analyses maternal Smoking_ASDPTO of 0.5 packs per day was identified as an independent risk for children's use of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Medications_ASDPTO (odds ratio 4.6, P = .0006) and for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP developing in the first year of life (odds ratio 2.6, P = .0006). Maternal Smoking_ASDPTO is also associated with increased numbers of Hospitalizations_ASDPTO by its association with an increased risk of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP as well as by contributing to Hospitalizations_ASDPTO independently of a child having Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Among children with Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, however, maternal Smoking_ASDPTO is not associated with increased numbers of Hospitalizations_ASDPTO. It was concluded that maternal Smoking_ASDPTO is associated with higher rates of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, an increased likelihood of using Asthma_ASDPTO_HP Medications_ASDPTO, and an earlier Onset_HP of the disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Treatment of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. New and time-tested strategies.Early, aggressive therapy in conjunction with good communication with a knowledgeable, caring physician may reverse the trends of increasing morbidity and mortality from Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. Allergen avoidance and immunotherapy are helpful in some patients. For those who need medication, bronchodilation with a beta 2-adrenergic drug, often in conjunction with an anticholinergic and theophylline, is the current treatment of choice for Acute_HP symptoms. For prophylaxis of Chronic_HP symptoms, sustained-release theophylline is still an excellent drug. However, an anti-inflammatory agent (eg, cromolyn sodium [Intal]) or, in some cases, an inhaled corticosteroid, may be an effective alternative. Whatever treatment is used, its success depends on effective self-management, which begins with education of the patient and family.

Changes in hospital management of Status_asthmaticus_HP by thoracic and general physicians in Birmingham and Manchester during 1978 and 1985.Hospital management of Status_asthmaticus_HP in 14 large hospitals in Birmingham and Manchester was audited in a random 20% of 1196 patients aged 15-45 years admitted in 1985. Of the 239 admissions randomised, 192 were suitable for study. Results were compared with those from a study in the same hospitals using the same methods in 1978. The age and sex of the patients and their Smoking_ASDPTO history, duration of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP, and hospital attendance were similar in 1978 and 1985. A much smaller proportion of patients presented with symptoms of over seven days' duration in 1985 (8.5%) than in 1978 (26%). The inpatient management of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP appears to have improved in both thoracic and general units, with more thorough functional assessments, more Frequent_HP performance of relevant investigations (arterial blood gases and peak expiratory flow rates) and more Frequent_HP use of recommended treatment (nebulised bronchodilators, oral and intravenous corticosteroids). Less difference was found in 1985 between units with a specialist thoracic interest and those without, though some differences remained in 1985 in monitoring of peak expiratory flow rate and arterial blood gases, outpatient prescribing, and follow up arrangements. Inhaled preventive medication was prescribed more Frequent_HPly than in 1978. In 1985 there was a 56% increase in admissions for Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. The proportion of Severe_HPly ill patients was similar to that in 1978, but in the most Severe_HP functional grade mean arterial carbon dioxide tension was higher in 1985 and more patients were ventilated. Our results suggest that hospital management by thoracic and general physicians has improved over the period 1978-85. Patients presented earlier in 1985, though there seems to have been an increase in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP of all grades of Severity_HP.

Reduced selenium in asthmatic subjects in New Zealand.Selenium is an essential component of glutathione peroxidase, an enzyme that helps protect cells against oxidation damage and modulates the lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism. Low selenium concentrations might therefore influence the inflammatory process in Asthma_ASDPTO_HP by reducing the activity of glutathione peroxidase. Whole blood and plasma selenium concentrations and glutathione peroxidase activity have been measured in 56 asthmatic patients and 59 non-asthmatic control subjects in New Zealand, a country with a low dietary selenium intake and a high prevalence of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP. When compared with control subjects the asthmatic patients had lower values for whole blood selenium concentrations (-4.9, 95% confidence interval -10.2 to 0.4 ng/ml) and glutathione peroxidase activity (-3.3, 95% CI -5.8 to -0.8 units/g Hb). There was a 1.9 and 5.8 fold increased risk of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in subjects with the lowest range of whole blood selenium concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity respectively (95% CI 0.6 to 5.6 and 1.6 to 21.2). Levels were lower in patients and control subjects without an atopic predisposition, but were not Affected_HP by prednisone use. Similar differences between the asthmatic and control subjects were not observed for selenium concentration or glutathione peroxidase activity measured in plasma, which reflects short term rather than long term selenium content. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that low selenium concentrations may have a role in the pathogenesis of Asthma_ASDPTO_HP in New Zealand.

Hyposensitization in asthmatics with mPEG-modified and unmodified house dust mite extract. IV. Occurrence and prediction of side effects.A double-blind study on hyposensitization (HS) with two extracts prepared from the house dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Dp) was performed on a group of asthmatics with bronchial sensitivity to Dp. In 18 patients, aluminium-hydroxide was added to the Dp-extract to give a depot effect (Dp-group). Nineteen patients were treated with a similar extract in which allergenicity had been reduced by coupling to monomethoxypolyethylene glycol (mPEG-Dp-group). This extract had previously been shown to have less effect on clinical symptoms and skin sensitivity compared to the Dp-extract. In the Dp- and mPEG-Dp-groups, 778 and 675 injections were administered. Fifteen and 12 patients in the Dp- and mPEG-Dp-groups had systemic reactions (P greater than 0.05). The Frequency_HP of injections giving systemic reactions was reduced in the mPEG-Dp-group: 5.1% compared to 9.0% in the Dp-group (P less than 0.01). In the mPEG-Dp-group, reactions were Mild_HP to Moderate_HP, mainly late-occurring Asthma_ASDPTO_HP and Urticaria_HP, whereas two episodes of Anaphylactic_shock_HP and four of Severe_HP Asthma_ASDPTO_HP occurred in the Dp-group. The reduction in side effects seems promising, but a further dose increase in the mPEG-Dp-group would be necessary to compare the side effects of doses with equal therapeutic effectiveness. High Frequency_HP of late local reactions made dose increase impossible with the present slightly modified extract. The systemic side effects occurred more frequently in patients highly skin test-sensitive to Dp prior to treatment. All patients skin test-positive to less than or equal to 100 BU had systemic reactions. Systemic side effects could not be predicted from the size of previous local reactions.
