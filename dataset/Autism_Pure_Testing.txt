Priorities for Advancing Research on Youth with Autism Spectrum Disorder and Co-occurring Anxiety.Research on anxiety disorders in youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has burgeoned in the past two decades. Yet, critical gaps exist with respect to measuring and treating anxiety in this population. This study used the nominal group technique to identify the most important research priorities on co-occurring anxiety in ASD. An international group of researchers and clinicians with experience in ASD and anxiety participated in the process. Topics ranked as most important focused on understanding how ASD symptoms affect treatment response, implementing treatments in real world settings, developing methods to disentangle overlapping symptoms between anxiety and ASD, and developing objective measures to assess anxiety. Collectively, these priorities can lead to collaborative studies to accelerate research in the field.
Individualized Levels System and Systematic Stimulus Pairing to Reduce Multiply Controlled Aggression of a Child With Autism Spectrum Disorder.Research has shown that physical aggression is common in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Interventions for multiply controlled aggression may be complex and difficult to implement with fidelity. As a result, the probability of treatment efficacy for this class of behavior may suffer. We designed an individualized levels system to reduce the physical aggression of an 11-year-old female with ASD. We then employed a systematic stimulus pairing procedure to facilitate generalization. Results suggest individualized levels systems can suppress multiply controlled aggression and that systematic stimulus pairing is an effective way to transfer treatment effects from trained therapists to caregivers.
Staff views on supporting evidence based practice for children with ASD.A variety of empirically supported interventions are available for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but previous research suggests that their selection and use within an evidence-based practice (EBP) framework in clinical settings is challenging. To date, research has primarily focused on identifying individual, organisational, and contextual barriers to EBP rather than identifying collaborative solutions to these barriers through consultation with staff. The aim of our study was to explore staff views on supporting EBP in their work with children with ASD.
A novel Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by recurrent attacks of dyskinetic movements without alteration of consciousness that are often triggered by the initiation of voluntary movements. Whole-exome sequencing has revealed a cluster of pathogenic variants in
What Are You Doing With That Object? Comparing the Neural Responses of Action Understanding in Adolescents With and Without Autism.Understanding another's actions, including what they are doing and why they are doing it, can be difficult for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This understanding is supported by the action observation (AON) and mentalizing (MZN) networks, as well as the superior temporal sulcus. We examined these areas in children with ASD and typically developing controls by having participants view eating and placing actions performed in conventional and unconventional ways while functional magnetic resonance images were collected. We found an effect of action-type, but not conventionality, in both groups, and a between groups difference only when viewing conventional eating actions. Findings suggest there are not global AON/MZN deficits in ASD, and observing unconventional actions may not spontaneously activate the MZN.
Abnormalities in interactions of Rho GTPases with scaffolding proteins contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders.Accumulating evidence suggests that Rho GTPases, together with scaffolding SHANK proteins, and associated signaling pathways play a role in the development of autism symptoms in various conditions. Research data have brought information on multiple intracellular signaling pathways, including Rho-associated protein kinases and serine/threonine-protein kinases involved in cytoskeleton rearranging. Alterations in downstream effectors of GTPase signaling pathways are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Bioinformatics and experimental data show that complex genetic and molecular defects (GTPases, actin-binding proteins, kinases, neuropeptides) can result in neuronal remodeling, leading to the functional connectivity deficits that manifest as the heterogeneous autism spectrum phenotype. Finally, the known hormone and neuropeptide oxytocin appears to be a factor for consideration in therapeutic intervention.
PSD95: A synaptic protein implicated in schizophrenia or autism?The molecular components of the postsynaptic density (PSD) in excitatory synapses of the brain are currently being investigated as one of the major etiologies of neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia (SCZ) and autism. Postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) is a major regulator of synaptic maturation by interacting, stabilizing and trafficking N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors (NMDARs) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isox-azoleproprionic acid receptors (AMPARs) to the postsynaptic membrane. Recently, there has been overwhelming evidence that associates PSD-95 disruption with cognitive and learning deficits observed in SCZ and autism. For instance, recent genomic and sequencing studies of psychiatric patients highlight the aberrations at the PSD of glutamatergic synapses that include PSD-95 dysfunction. In animal studies, PSD-95 deficiency shows alterations in NMDA and AMPA-receptor composition and function in specific brain regions that may contribute to phenotypes observed in neuropsychiatric pathologies. In this review, we describe the role of PSD-95 as an essential scaffolding protein during synaptogenesis and neurodevelopment. More specifically, we discuss its interactions with NMDA receptor subunits that potentially affect glutamate transmission, and the formation of silent synapses during critical time points of neurodevelopment. Furthermore, we describe how PSD-95 may alter dendritic spine morphologies, thus regulating synaptic function that influences behavioral phenotypes in SCZ versus autism. Understanding the role of PSD-95 in the neuropathologies of SCZ and autism will give an insight of the cellular and molecular attributes in the disorders, thus providing treatment options in patients affected.
Autism, Attention, and Alpha Oscillations: An Electrophysiological Study of Attentional Capture.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with deficits in adaptively orienting attention to behaviorally-relevant information. Neural oscillatory activity plays a key role in brain function and provides a high-resolution temporal marker of attention dynamics. Alpha band (8-12 Hz) activity is associated with both selecting task-relevant stimuli and filtering task-irrelevant information.
Symbolic Play in School-Aged Minimally Verbal Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.Few interventions exist for school-aged minimally verbal children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Even though play skills are associated with children's production of language, few studies have focused on play for minimally verbal children. Fifty-eight minimally verbal children with ASD received a naturalistic developmental behavioral intervention. Children were randomized to receive a speech generating device in the context of the intervention or not. Children in both conditions improved in play skills at exit. Children demonstrated an increase in play skills in proximal (sessions) and distal (during blind assessment) contexts. Minimally verbal children with ASD can improve their play skills within a targeted intervention. Increases in symbolic play were associated with increases in expressive language skills.
Refractive Status and Amblyopia Risk Factors in Chinese Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.Amblyopia risk factors in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are usually hard to detect in early childhood due to poor cooperation and has not been reported in the Chinese population. We screened 168 Chinese children with ASD, aged between 3 and 8 years, and 264 age-matched neurotypical children with Spot photoscreener and basic ophthalmologic examinations. Children with ASD were found to have normal refractive status but significantly higher incidence of strabismus (16.1%), compared with control children (1.5%) (p < 0.01). Most of the cases of strabismus found in children with ASD were classified as esodeviation. Strabismus in children with ASD should be considered more seriously as an amblyopia risk factor by ophthalmologists and other healthcare professionals.
Children with optic nerve hypoplasia face a high risk of neurodevelopmental disorders.Optic nerve hypoplasia (ONH) is a congenital ocular malformation that has been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, but the prevalence in unilateral disease and less severe visual impairment is unknown. We studied intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) in patients with ONH.
Further Analysis of the Predictive Effects of a Free-Operant Competing Stimulus Assessment on Stereotypy.We conducted five experiments to evaluate the predictive validity of a free-operant competing stimulus assessment (FOCSA). In Experiment 1, we showed that each participant's repetitive behavior persisted without social consequences. In Experiment 2, we used the FOCSA to identify high-preference, low-stereotypy (HP-LS) items for 11 participants and high-preference, high-stereotypy (HP-HS) items for nine participants. To validate the results of the FOCSAs (Experiment 3), we used a three-component multiple schedule to evaluate the immediate and subsequent effects of an HP-LS stimulus, an HP-HS stimulus, or both (in separate test sequences) on each participant's stereotypy. Results of Experiment 3 showed that the FOCSA correctly predicted the immediate effect of the HP-LS stimulus for 10 of 11 participants; however, the FOCSA predictions were less accurate for the HP-HS stimulus. Results of Experiment 4 showed that a differential reinforcement of other behavior procedure in which participants earned access to the HP-LS for omitting vocal stereotypy increased all five participants' latency to engaging in stereotypy; however, clinically significant omission durations were only achieved for one participant. Experiment 5 showed that differential reinforcement of alternative behavior in which participants earned access to the HP-LS stimulus contingent upon correct responses during discrete-trial training reduced targeted and nontargeted stereotypy and increased correct academic responding for all four participants. The potential utility of the FOCSA is discussed.
Tied to the worldly work of writing: Parent as ethnographer.Parent narratives have contributed to ethnographic accounts of the lives of children with autism, but there are fewer examples of parents producing their own autoethnographies. This article explores the affordances of an online blog for enabling a parent of a child with autism to produce a written record of practice which may be considered 'autoethnographic'. Richardson's framework for ethnography as Creative Analytic Process (CAP) is applied to extracts from a blog post in order to consider its contribution, reflexivity, aesthetic merit and impact. The article addresses the methodological and ethical implications of reconceptualizing parents as researchers and the potential contribution of new writing platforms to the development of auto/ethnography.
Impaired repair of DNA damage is associated with autistic-like traits in rats prenatally exposed to valproic acid.Prenatal exposure to the antiepileptic and mood stabilizer valproic acid (VPA) is an environmental risk factor for autism spectrum disorders (ASD), although recent epidemiological studies show that the public awareness of this association is still limited. Based on the clinical findings, prenatal VPA exposure in rodents is a widely used preclinical model of ASD. However, there is limited information about the precise biochemical mechanisms underlying the link between ASD and VPA. Here, we tested the effects of increasing doses of VPA on behavioral features resembling core and secondary symptoms of ASD in rats. Only when administered prenatally at the dose of 500mg/kg, VPA induced deficits in communication and social discrimination in rat pups, and altered social behavior and emotionality in the adolescent and adult offspring in the absence of gross malformations. This dose of VPA inhibited histone deacetylase in rat embryos and favored the formation of DNA double strand breaks (DSB), but impaired their repair. The defective DSB response was no more visible in one-day-old pups, thus supporting the hypothesis that unrepaired VPA-induced DNA damage at the time of neural tube closure may underlie the autistic-like traits displayed in the course of development by rats prenatally exposed to VPA. These experiments help to understand the neurodevelopmental trajectories affected by prenatal VPA exposure and identify a biochemical link between VPA exposure during gestation and ASD.
The Association Between Child and Family Characteristics and the Mental Health and Wellbeing of Caregivers of Children with Autism in Mid-Childhood.We examined predictors of mental health difficulties and wellbeing in caregivers of children with autism in the Pre-school Autism Communication Trial cohort in middle childhood (N = 104). Child's intellectual disability, daily living skills impairment, elevated emotional and behavioural difficulties, high educational level of caregiver and household income below the median significantly predicted caregivers' mental health difficulties, but autism severity, child communication skills and family circumstances did not. Lower caregiver mental wellbeing was predicted by elevated child emotional and behavioural difficulties. The need to support the mental health and wellbeing of caregivers of children with autism is discussed in light of the results.
Do Parents Model Gestures Differently When Children's Gestures Differ?Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or with Down syndrome (DS) show diagnosis-specific differences from typically developing (TD) children in gesture production. We asked whether these differences reflect the differences in parental gesture input. Our systematic observations of 23 children with ASD and 23 with DS (M
Parent-Implemented Bedtime Fading and Positive Routines for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders.Sleep disorders affect a large portion of those with autism spectrum disorder. Behavioural interventions have been found to increase appropriate sleep behaviours. This study sought to examine the efficacy of two stimulus control interventions (bedtime fading and positive routines) on total sleep duration, sleep onset latency and frequency and duration of night wakings for children with autism using two multiple baseline designs. Secondary dependent variables, namely, educational opportunities, challenging behaviours, parent acceptance and social validity were also analysed. Results suggest some efficacy for both interventions. Increased total sleep duration and decreased sleep onset latency were achieved with bedtime fading. Positive routines showed mixed results with decreased sleep onset latency and increased total sleep duration for two of three participants.
Self-Injurious Behavior in Children With Developmental Disabilities: A Systematic Review of Behavioral Intervention Literature.We reviewed single-case research studies examining the effects of behavioral interventions for self-injurious behavior (SIB) in young children with autism and developmental disabilities. Systematic searches of electronic databases, journals, and reference lists identified 46 studies (66 participants younger than the age of 12) meeting inclusion criteria. Studies were examined based on (a) participant demographics, (b) topography and function of SIB, (c) type of functional behavior assessment (FBA), (d) intervention procedures and outcomes, and (e) experimental design and measurement. Intervention strategies were categorized as antecedent manipulations, teaching behavior, consequence-based procedures, and/or extinction procedures. Positive outcomes were reported for 78% of participants in the reviewed studies and 88% of the participants were diagnosed with autism. Results suggest the effectiveness of behavioral interventions to decrease SIB for young children with disabilities; however, the frequent use of packaged interventions without component analysis limits the conclusiveness of any treatment recommendation. Suggestions for future research are discussed.
Magnetoencephalography reveals an increased non-target P3a, but not target P3b, that is associated with high non-clinical psychosocial deficits.Auditory processing deficits are frequently identified in autism and schizophrenia, and the two disorders have been shown to share psychosocial difficulties. This study used magnetoencephalography to investigate auditory processing differences for those with a high degree of a non-clinical autistic and schizotypal trait phenotype, Social Disorganisation (SD). Participants were 18 low (9 female) and 19 high (9 female) SD scorers (18-40 years) who completed a three-stimulus auditory oddball paradigm of speech sounds (standard: 100ms 'o', deviant: 150ms 'o', novel: 150ms 'e'). Spatio-temporal cluster analysis revealed increased amplitude for the high SD group in a left (p = 0.006) and a right (p = 0.020) hemisphere cluster in response to the novel non-target. No cluster differences were found in response to the target deviant. These findings suggest that those with a high degree of the SD phenotype recruit more cortical resources when processing unattended, novel speech stimuli, which may lead to psychosocial deficits.
Chronic Intranasal Oxytocin has Dose-dependent Effects on Central Oxytocin and Vasopressin Systems in Prairie Voles (Microtus ochrogaster).Oxytocin (Oxt) is a neuropeptide with many functions, including modulation of social behavior(s) and anxiety. Due to its notable pro-social effects, it has been proposed as a treatment in the management of neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, and social anxiety; however, effects of long-term daily treatment are still being explored. Previously, we have shown that in male prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) exposure to Oxt during the peri-adolescent period impaired adult pair bonding in a dose-dependent fashion. In females, the medium dose used (0.8 IU/kg) appeared to facilitate pair bonding, and the low and medium doses were associated with fewer lines crossed in the open field. In this study, we examined central receptor binding and immunoreactive (IR) protein for Oxt and vasopressin (Avp), a closely related peptide. Voles were treated with saline vehicle, or one of three doses of Oxt (0.08, 0.8, 8.0 IU/kg) for three weeks from postnatal days 21 to 42, and euthanized as adults. We used autoradiography to examine Oxt and Avp receptor binding and immunohistochemistry to examine Oxt and Avp - IR cells in the paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic (SON) nuclei of the hypothalamus. Females that received the medium dose of Oxt had higher Oxt receptor binding in the nucleus accumbens shell (NAS), while males that received the medium dose had lower Avp-IR cells in the PVN. In summary, we found sex-specific effects of long-term exposure to intranasal Oxt on the Oxt and Avp systems at the weight-adjusted dose currently being used in clinical trials in humans.
Long-Term Perspectives of Family Quality of Life Following Music Therapy With Young Children on the Autism Spectrum: A Phenomenological Study.Parents of children on the autism spectrum have consistently reported feeling uncertain in their parenting role, and desire more practical advice from service providers about how to support their child in the home. There is growing recognition of the need for interventions to provide support to the family as well as fostering child development outcomes.
Instructing children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: Examining swim instructors' knowledge building experiences.Although there has been a notable increase in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnoses over the past twenty years, children with ASD continue to be underrepresented in physical activity opportunities. Swimming lessons have been suggested as an ideal form of physical activity for this population, but studies exploring instructors' experiences gaining knowledge specific for instructing these swimmers remains limited. Research in this area is warranted, as drowning is a leading injury cause of death for persons with ASD.
Enhancing the Validity of a Quality of Life Measure for Autistic People.Accurate measurement of quality of life (QoL) is important for evaluation of autism services and trials of interventions. We undertook psychometric validation of the World Health Organisation measure-WHOQoL-BREF, examined construct validity of the WHO Disabilities module and developed nine additional autism-specific items (ASQoL) from extensive consultation with the autism community. The sample of 309 autistic people was recruited from the Adult Autism Spectrum Cohort-UK. The WHOQoL-BREF had good psychometric properties, including criterion, convergent, divergent and discriminant validity. The WHO Disabilities module showed adequate construct validity and reliability. The ASQoL items form a unitary factor of QoL, with one global item. Future studies can use the WHO measures alongside the ASQoL items to measure QoL of autistic people.
Developmental Connectivity and Molecular Phenotypes of Unique Cortical Projection Neurons that Express a Synapse-Associated Receptor Tyrosine Kinase.The complex circuitry and cell-type diversity of the cerebral cortex are required for its high-level functions. The mechanisms underlying the diversification of cortical neurons during prenatal development have received substantial attention, but understanding of neuronal heterogeneity is more limited during later periods of cortical circuit maturation. To address this knowledge gap, connectivity analysis and molecular phenotyping of cortical neuron subtypes that express the developing synapse-enriched MET receptor tyrosine kinase were performed. Experiments used a MetGFP transgenic mouse line, combined with coexpression analysis of class-specific molecular markers and retrograde connectivity mapping. The results reveal that MET is expressed by a minor subset of subcerebral and a larger number of intratelencephalic projection neurons. Remarkably, MET is excluded from most layer 6 corticothalamic neurons. These findings are particularly relevant for understanding the maturation of discrete cortical circuits, given converging evidence that MET influences dendritic elaboration and glutamatergic synapse maturation. The data suggest that classically defined cortical projection classes can be further subdivided based on molecular characteristics that likely influence synaptic maturation and circuit wiring. Additionally, given that MET is classified as a high confidence autism risk gene, the data suggest that projection neuron subpopulations may be differentially vulnerable to disorder-associated genetic variation.
The adenosine ARestricted interests and repetitive behaviors (RRBs) are a defining feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To date there are limited options for treating this core symptomology. Treatments that stimulate adenosine A
A Recurrent De Novo Nonsense Variant in ZSWIM6 Results in Severe Intellectual Disability without Frontonasal or Limb Malformations.A recurrent de novo missense variant within the C-terminal Sin3-like domain of ZSWIM6 was previously reported to cause acromelic frontonasal dysostosis (AFND), an autosomal-dominant severe frontonasal and limb malformation syndrome, associated with neurocognitive and motor delay, via a proposed gain-of-function effect. We present detailed phenotypic information on seven unrelated individuals with a recurrent de novo nonsense variant (c.2737C>T [p.Arg913Ter]) in the penultimate exon of ZSWIM6 who have severe-profound intellectual disability and additional central and peripheral nervous system symptoms but an absence of frontonasal or limb malformations. We show that the c.2737C>T variant does not trigger nonsense-mediated decay of the ZSWIM6 mRNA in affected individual-derived cells. This finding supports the existence of a truncated ZSWIM6 protein lacking the Sin3-like domain, which could have a dominant-negative effect. This study builds support for a key role for ZSWIM6 in neuronal development and function, in addition to its putative roles in limb and craniofacial development, and provides a striking example of different variants in the same gene leading to distinct phenotypes.
Graph theoretical approaches towards understanding differences in frontoparietal and default mode networks in Autism.Autism Spectrum Disorder is a complex developmental disorder affecting 1 in 68 children in the United States. While the prevalence may be on the rise, we currently lack a firm understanding of the etiology of the disease, and diagnosis is made purely on behavioral observation and informant report. As one method to improve our understanding of the disease, the current study took a systems-level approach by assessing the causal interactions among the frontoparietal and default mode networks using structural covariance of a large Autism dataset. Although preliminary, we report diffuse yet subtle changes throughout these networks when comparing age and sex matched controls to ASD patients.
Infantile Tremor Syndrome in Modern Times.Infantile tremor syndrome (ITS) is a clinical syndrome of acute or gradual onset of mental and psychomotor changes, pigmentary disturbances of hair and skin, pallor, and tremors in malnourished children aged between 5 months and 3 years. It is a well-known entity, but the exact etiopathogenesis is still not known.
Early development of infants with neurofibromatosis type 1: a case series.Prospective studies of infants at familial risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have yielded insights into the earliest signs of the disorder but represent heterogeneous samples of unclear aetiology. Complementing this approach by studying cohorts of infants with monogenic syndromes associated with high rates of ASD offers the opportunity to elucidate the factors that lead to ASD.
Brief Report: Factor Analysis of the Brazilian Version of the Adult Autism Spectrum Quotient.This study examined the factor structure of the Brazilian version of the Autism-Spectrum Quotient. This is a self-report questionnaire for continuous and quantitative assessment of autistic spectrum traits in adults. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed on the five-factor model (social skill, attention switching, attention to detail, communication and imagination) proposed by the original authors, support not being found for this model in our sample. An exploratory factor analysis was then performed that resulted in an alternative three-factor model (social skills, details/patterns and imagination). Confirmatory factor analysis of the latter model revealed adequate psychometric indexes. The Brazilian version of the AQ was shown to be an adequate instrument for the evaluation of signs compatible with the autism spectrum in adults.
Implementing and evaluating early intervention for children with autism: Where are the gaps and what should we do?Despite recent advances, the evidence base supporting early intervention for young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remains relatively sparse. The International Society for Autism Research (INSAR) recently sponsored a Special Interest Group (SIG) on Implementing and Evaluating Community-Based Early Intervention. Across three meetings, in 2015, 2016, and 2017, conveners of this SIG engaged >200 members to identify knowledge gaps and research priorities for moving the field forward. Here, we summarize the perspectives that emerged from group discussion at the SIG meetings as represented by scholars working actively in the field. Despite encouraging progress, critical gaps and research priorities were identified across all the stages of intervention development and testing from conceptualization to community implementation. Key issues include the need for (a) formal theories to guide early intervention development, evaluation, and implementation; and alignment of intervention goals with scientific knowledge and societal changes that have occurred in the decades since interventions were originally developed; (b) increased focus on feasibility of treatment procedures and alignment with stakeholder values during pilot evaluations; (c) use of research designs that allow for comparisons of different interventions and formats, analyses of active ingredients of treatment, and identification of moderators and mediators of outcome; (d) use of community-partnered participatory research to guide adaptation of intervention models to community settings; (e) inclusion of constructs related to implementation processes and outcomes in treatment trials and; (f) an iterative approach to the progression of knowledge from intervention development to implementation.

The Role of Omega-3 Fatty Acids in Developmental Psychopathology: A Systematic Review on Early Psychosis, Autism, and ADHD.In this systematic review, we will consider and debate studies that have explored the effects of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in three major, and somehow related, developmental psychiatric disorders: Autism, Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity disorder and Psychosis. The impact of ω-3 PUFAs on clinical symptoms and, if possible, brain trajectory in children and adolescents suffering from these illnesses will be reviewed and discussed, considering the biological plausibility of the effects of omega-3 fatty acids, together with their potential perspectives in the field. Heterogeneity in study designs will be discussed in the light of differences in results and interpretation of studies carried out so far.
Fundamental Elements in Autism: From Neurogenesis and Neurite Growth to Synaptic Plasticity.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a set of neurodevelopmental disorders with a high prevalence and impact on society. ASDs are characterized by deficits in both social behavior and cognitive function. There is a strong genetic basis underlying ASDs that is highly heterogeneous; however, multiple studies have highlighted the involvement of key processes, including neurogenesis, neurite growth, synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity in the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders. In this review article, we focus on the major genes and signaling pathways implicated in ASD and discuss the cellular, molecular and functional studies that have shed light on common dysregulated pathways using
Syntactic and Story Structure Complexity in the Narratives of High- and Low-Language Ability Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.Although language impairment is commonly associated with the autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the Diagnostic Statistical Manual no longer includes language impairment as a necessary component of an ASD diagnosis (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). However, children with ASD and no comorbid intellectual disability struggle with some aspects of language whose precise nature is still outstanding. Narratives have been extensively used as a tool to examine lexical and syntactic abilities, as well as pragmatic skills in children with ASD. This study contributes to this literature by investigating the narrative skills of 30 Greek-speaking children with ASD and normal non-verbal IQ, 16 with language skills in the upper end of the normal range (ASD-HL), and 14 in the lower end of the normal range (ASD-LL). The control group consisted of 15 age-matched typically-developing (TD) children. Narrative performance was measured in terms of both microstructural and macrostructural properties. Microstructural properties included lexical and syntactic measures of complexity such as subordinate vs. coordinate clauses and types of subordinate clauses. Macrostructure was measured in terms of the diversity in the use of internal state terms (ISTs) and story structure complexity, i.e., children's ability to produce important units of information that involve the setting, characters, events, and outcomes of the story, as well as the characters' thoughts and feelings. The findings demonstrate that high language ability and syntactic complexity pattern together in ASD children's narrative performance and that language ability compensates for autistic children's pragmatic deficit associated with the production of Theory of Mind-related ISTs. Nevertheless, both groups of children with ASD (high and low language ability) scored lower than the TD controls in the production of Theory of Mind-unrelated ISTs, modifier clauses and story structure complexity.
Error-related brain activity and anxiety symptoms in youth with autism spectrum disorder.Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often experience symptoms associated with generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and social anxiety disorder. In other populations, these same symptoms are associated with a larger error-related negativity (ERN), an event-related potential that reflects endogenous threat sensitivity. As such, it is possible that the ERN may relate to the clinical presentation of anxiety in ASD. However, studies examining these associations in youth with ASD have yielded mixed results. The present study aimed to clarify this relationship by examining the ERN in relation to these specific anxiety symptoms in ASD, and by accounting for typical covariates (e.g., age, verbal abilities, depression, ASD symptoms) of the ERN. Fifty-one youth, ages 8-17, with ASD and intact cognitive ability completed a modified Flanker task, from which the ERN component was obtained. Measures of anxiety, verbal abilities, depression, and ASD symptoms were collected from participants and parents. Results revealed that greater self-reported social anxiety symptoms, specifically performance fears but not humiliation/rejection fears, were associated with an increased neural response to errors, as measured by the ERN. This relationship remained after controlling for other anxiety symptoms, as well as age, verbal IQ, depression symptoms, and ASD symptoms. Findings suggest that heightened threat sensitivity may be characteristic of individuals with ASD who exhibit social fearfulness.

Cellular Phenotypes in Human iPSC-Derived Neurons from a Genetic Model of Autism Spectrum Disorder.A deletion or duplication in the 16p11.2 region is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. In addition to clinical characteristics, carriers of the 16p11.2 copy-number variant (CNV) manifest opposing neuroanatomical phenotypes-e.g., macrocephaly in deletion carriers (16pdel) and microcephaly in duplication carriers (16pdup). Using fibroblasts obtained from 16pdel and 16pdup carriers, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and differentiated them into neurons to identify causal cellular mechanisms underlying neurobiological phenotypes. Our study revealed increased soma size and dendrite length in 16pdel neurons and reduced neuronal size and dendrite length in 16pdup neurons. The functional properties of iPSC-derived neurons corroborated aspects of these contrasting morphological differences that may underlie brain size. Interestingly, both 16pdel and 16pdup neurons displayed reduced synaptic density, suggesting that distinct mechanisms may underlie brain size and neuronal connectivity at this locus.
A Clinic-Based Assessment for Evaluating Job-Related Social Skills in Adolescents and Adults with Autism.Many individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have difficulties obtaining and maintaining employment, yet little research has evaluated methods for assessing and improving critical vocational skills. In this study, we evaluated an assessment of job-related social skills for individuals with ASD by arranging conditions that simulated on-the-job experiences in a clinic setting. The experimenter contrived situations to assess a variety of social skills, including asking for help, asking for more materials, and responding to corrective feedback. A total of eight individuals, aged 16 to 32 years, participated. Results suggested that the assessment was useful for identifying specific social skills that could be targeted for intervention to increase success in the work environment. These findings add to the current literature by demonstrating an objective method for assessing a variety of job-related social skills under controlled, naturalistic conditions.
Using Multiple Exemplar Training to Teach Empathy Skills to Children with Autism.The purpose of the study was to use multiple exemplar training to teach empathetic responding to two children with autism. Three emotions-happiness, frustration and sadness/pain-were chosen for this purpose. Treatment consisted of verbal prompting and reinforcement of empathetic responses. Four experimenter-defined categories with discriminative stimuli were used for each emotion. The multiple exemplar component of the model consisted of teaching responses in the presence of several discriminative stimuli drawn from the predefined categories for each emotion delivered by two persons across two environments. Results were evaluated using a multiple baseline design across behaviours and indicate a systematic increase in responses with the introduction of treatment across each category for both participants. Generalization of responses from training to non-training stimuli in both participants was observed during probe trials and was maintained during follow-up probes.
A Response to Papatola and Lustig's Paper on Navigating a Managed Care Peer Review: Guidance for Clinicians Using Applied Behavior Analysis in the Treatment of Children on the Autism Spectrum.In their 2016 article, "Navigating a Managed Care Peer Review: Guidance for Clinicians Using Applied Behavior Analysis [ABA] in the Treatment of Children on the Autism Spectrum," Papatola and Lustig provide an overview of the managed care process, discuss the medical necessity of ABA, and offer guidance to clinicians on how to navigate the managed care peer review process. Given that the authors are employed by a large international health insurance carrier and conduct peer reviews on behalf of that organization, this response seeks to provide guidance from both the clinical and public policy perspectives that reflect best practices in the field of autism treatment. This response is not written with the intention of providing or replacing legal advice; rather, this paper offers health care providers of ABA an essential understanding of some of the laws that govern and support their efforts to secure medically necessary treatment and the mechanisms in place with which to challenge decisions by managed care organizations, health plans, and health insurance issuers that may be contrary to best practices. Finally, suggestions are offered on how to navigate a peer review to ensure optimal outcomes and, when necessary, to lay the groundwork to overturn a funding source decision that does not reflect best practices or the standard of care in ABA-based autism treatment.
Treating Food Approval-Seeking Behavior: One Bite at a Time.The prevalence of feeding problems in children with autism is high. The current investigation was a treatment of a unique presentation of food-related prompt dependence with a 6-year-old boy with autism who was reliant upon approval from adults for consumption of every bite of food. Instructions were used to establish independent eating, in which the number of bites specified in the instruction was systematically increased. Independent bites increased from a baseline level of 0.67% to a final phase level of almost 100%, and the instruction was faded to "eat your lunch".
The Effects of Advance Notice on Problem Behavior Occasioned by Interruptions of an Ongoing Activity in a Young Girl with Autism.The current study describes a trial-based functional analysis of problem behavior conducted in a home setting for a 7-year-old girl with autism. Problem behavior was occasioned by interruptions to an ongoing activity. Advance notice, in the form of a 2-min warning, and the sound of a timer were used to signal termination of a current activity and were effective at reducing problem behavior along with increasing compliance to the interruptive demands. A trial-based functional analysis, which are not common in the applied literature, was conducted in a home setting for young girl with autism, using antecedent and consequence modifications described by Hagopian, Bruzek, Bowman, and Jennett (2007), identified the variables that occasioned and maintained problem behavior were interruptions to an ongoing activity followed by regaining uninterrupted access to the previous activity. Mixed findings have been reported regarding the effectiveness of advance notice for decreasing problem behavior. Results of the current study show that an advance notice treatment package was effective for a child with autism; no escape extinction was necessary. Interruptions are part of everyday life and tolerating these changes is critical for habilitation for individuals with autism.
Documenting and Understanding Parent's Intervention Choices for Their Child with Autism Spectrum Disorder.Understanding why parents choose some interventions but not others for their child with autism is important for a number of reasons. Estimating the proportion of evidence-based interventions engaged, identifying the agencies influencing parental decisions, and elucidating the barriers or reasons leading to intervention rejection or discontinuation can result in better service provision. New Zealand parents (n = 570) of a child with autism reported what interventions were being engaged, and why some interventions were engaged but not others. Funding was a major determinant of intervention engagement, while medical professionals exerted the most influence. Sources of support were not related to intervention engagement, but parental perceptions of their child's symptom severity were. Finally, non-engagement does not necessarily reflect parental opposition to an intervention, but rather the existence of barriers.
Prolonged Time Lag to Final Diagnosis of Fragile X Syndrome.To evaluate the diagnostic process in children ultimately diagnosed with fragile X syndrome (FXS), with an emphasis on the time lag between initial presentation and on diagnosis in female vs male children.
Characteristics of unintentional drowning deaths in children with autism spectrum disorder.The reported prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has increased markedly in the past two decades. Recent research indicates that children with ASD are at a substantially increased risk of injury mortality, particularly from unintentional drowning. The purpose of this study was to explore the circumstances of fatal unintentional drowning incidents involving children with ASD under 15 years of age.
A novel approach to training attention and gaze in ASD: A feasibility and efficacy pilot study.In addition to the social, communicative and behavioral symptoms that define the disorder, individuals with ASD have difficulty re-orienting attention quickly and accurately. Similarly, fast re-orienting saccadic eye movements are also inaccurate and more variable in both endpoint and timing. Atypical gaze and attention are among the earliest symptoms observed in ASD. Disruption of these foundation skills critically affects the development of higher level cognitive and social behavior. We propose that interventions aimed at these early deficits that support social and cognitive skills will be broadly effective. We conducted a pilot clinical trial designed to demonstrate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of using gaze-contingent video games for low-cost in-home training of attention and eye movement. Eight adolescents with ASD participated in an 8-week training, with pre-, mid- and post-testing of eye movement and attention control. Six of the eight adolescents completed the 8 weeks of training and all six showed improvement in attention (orienting, disengagement) and eye movement control or both. All game systems remained intact for the duration of training and all participants could use the system independently. We delivered a robust, low-cost, gaze-contingent game system for home use that, in our pilot training sample, improved the attention orienting and eye movement performance of adolescent participants in 8 weeks of training. We are currently conducting a clinical trial to replicate these results and to examine what, if any, aspects of training transfer to more real-world tasks. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

DYRK1A-haploinsufficiency in mice causes autistic-like features and febrile seizures.Mutations and copy number variants affecting DYRK1A gene encoding the dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A are among the most frequent genetic causes of neurodevelopmental disorders including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) associated with microcephaly, febrile seizures and severe speech acquisition delay. Here we developed a mouse model harboring a frame-shift mutation in Dyrk1a resulting in a protein truncation and elimination of its kinase activity site. Dyrk1a
Aberrant development of the asymmetry between hemispheric brain white matter networks in autism spectrum disorder.Atypical brain asymmetry/lateralization has long been hypothesized for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and this model has been repeatedly supported by various neuroimaging studies. Recently, hemispheric network topologies have been found to be asymmetric, thereby providing a new avenue for investigating brain asymmetries under various conditions. To date, however, how network topological asymmetries are altered in ASD remains largely unexplored. To clarify this, the present study included ASD individuals from the newly released Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange II database (58 right-handed male ASD individuals aged 5 to 26 years and 70 age- and IQ-matched typically developing (TD) individuals). Diffusion and structural magnetic resonance imaging were used to construct hemispheric white matter networks, and graph-theory approaches were applied to quantify topological efficiencies for hemispheric networks. Statistical analyses revealed a decreased rightward asymmetry of network efficiencies with increasing age in the TD group, but not in the ASD group. More specifically, the TD group did not exhibit an age-related increase in network efficiency in the right hemisphere, but the ASD group did. For the left hemisphere, no difference between the groups was observed for the developmental trajectory of network efficiencies. Intriguingly, within the ASD group, more severe restricted and repetitive behavior in ASD was found to be correlated with less rightward asymmetry of network local efficiency. These findings provide suggestive evidence of atypical network topological asymmetries and offer important insights into the abnormal development of ASD brains.
Copy number variants in people with autism spectrum disorders and co-morbid psychosis.The genetic association between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia is complicated and mirrors the clinical overlap between these conditions to some degree. However, no studies to date have examined the genetics of individuals dually diagnosed with both ASD and psychosis. In this study, we present findings of copy number variants (CNVs) from a study of 116 well-characterised individuals with this dual diagnosis. DNA was extracted and arrayed using the Affymetrix CytoScan HD 2.8M array or the Affymetrix Cytogenetics arrays and compared with existing samples from the Database of Genomic Variants and the Simons Simplex Collection of CNVs from individuals with ASD and their families. Twenty-seven novel CNVs ≥20k base pairs were identified in the sample, most occurring in only a single individual, although two were found in two female participants. Forty-nine rare CNVs (<1.5% rate in general population) were also found at significantly higher frequencies than expected. The findings may provide evidence for areas of further study in the understanding of the development of both ASD and psychosis due to the number of affected genetic regions that have not previously been linked to these conditions.
Tourette syndrome and other neurodevelopmental disorders: a comprehensive review.Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (TS) is a complex developmental neuropsychiatric condition in which motor manifestations are often accompanied by comorbid conditions that impact the patient's quality of life. In the DSM-5, TS belongs to the "neurodevelopmental disorders" group, together with other neurodevelopmental conditions, frequently co-occurring. In this study, we searched the PubMed database using a combination of keywords associating TS and all neurodevelopmental diagnoses. From 1009 original reports, we identified 36 studies addressing TS and neurodevelopmental comorbidities. The available evidence suggests the following: (1) neurodevelopmental comorbidities in TS are the rule, rather than the exception; (2) attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most frequent; (3) there is a continuum from a simple (TS + ADHD or/and learning disorder) to a more complex phenotype (TS + autism spectrum disorder). We conclude that a prompt diagnosis and a detailed description of TS comorbidities are necessary not only to understand the aetiological basis of neurodevelopmental disorders but also to address specific rehabilitative and therapeutic approaches.
Altered Expression of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Related Genes in the Middle Frontal Cortex of Subjects with Autism Spectrum Disorder.The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an important organelle responsible for the folding and sorting of proteins. Disturbances in ER homeostasis can trigger a cellular response known as the unfolded protein response, leading to accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER lumen called ER stress. A number of recent studies suggest that mutations in autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-susceptible synaptic genes induce ER stress. However, it is not known whether ER stress-related genes are altered in the brain of ASD subjects. In the present study, we investigated the mRNA expression of ER stress-related genes (ATF4, ATF6, PERK, XBP1, sXBP1, CHOP, and IRE1) in the postmortem middle frontal gyrus of ASD and control subjects. RT-PCR analysis showed significant increases in the mRNA levels of ATF4, ATF6, PERK, XBP1, CHOP, and IRE1 in the middle frontal gyrus of ASD subjects. In addition, we found a significant positive association of mRNA levels of ER stress genes with the diagnostic score for stereotyped behavior in ASD subjects. These results, for the first time, provide the evidence of the dysregulation of ER stress genes in the brain of subjects with ASD.
Beyond Autism: Introducing the Dialectical Misattunement Hypothesis and a Bayesian Account of Intersubjectivity.Drawing on sociocultural theories and Bayesian accounts of brain function, in this article we construe psychiatric conditions as disorders of social interaction to fully account for their complexity and dynamicity across levels of description and temporal scales. After an introduction of the theoretical underpinnings of our integrative approach, we take autism spectrum conditions (ASC) as a paradigm example and discuss how neurocognitive hypotheses can be translated into a Bayesian formulation, i.e., in terms of predictive processing and active inference. We then argue that consideration of individuals (even within a Bayesian framework) will not be enough for a comprehensive understanding of psychiatric conditions and consequently put forward the dialectical misattunement hypothesis, which views psychopathology not merely as disordered function within single brains but also as a dynamic interpersonal mismatch that encompasses various levels of description. Moving from a mere comparison of groups, i.e., "healthy" persons versus "patients," to a fine-grained analysis of social interactions within dyads and groups of individuals will open new avenues and may allow to avoid an overly neurocentric scope in psychiatric research as well as help to reduce social exclusion.
Friendships and social participation as markers of quality of life of adolescents and adults with fragile X syndrome and autism.Friendships and social participation are key domains of quality of life for individuals with intellectual disabilities. This study examined the friendships, social and recreational activities, and family social networks of individuals with intellectual disabilities from two distinct diagnostic groups: individuals diagnosed with fragile X syndrome (n = 81) compared with those diagnosed with autistic disorder (n = 226). Within each diagnostic group, individuals in two developmental stages were compared: adolescence and adulthood. Quality of life in friendships and social participation domains was notably low for individuals with fragile X and those with autism. Individuals with fragile X had more friendships and a less negative social impact on the family than individuals with autism. Across both groups, adolescents spent less time with friends and neighbors, and more time in exercising, than did adults.
No preliminary evidence of differences in astrocyte density within the white matter of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in autism.While evidence for white matter and astrocytic abnormalities exist in autism, a detailed investigation of astrocytes has not been conducted. Such an investigation is further warranted by an increasing role for neuroinflammation in autism pathogenesis, with astrocytes being key players in this process. We present the first study of astrocyte density and morphology within the white matter of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in individuals with autism.
Brief Report: Factors Associated with Emergency Department Visits for Epilepsy Among Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.We examined how demographic and clinical characteristics differ between emergency department (ED) visits for epilepsy (EP cohort) and ED visits for other reasons (non-EP cohort) in children with ASD. The data were drawn from the 2009 and 2010 Nationwide Emergency Department Sample. We performed both univariate and multivariate analyses to compare and contrast similarities and differences between EP cohort and non-EP cohort among children with ASD. The results showed ED visits in EP cohort were more likely to occur among adolescents aged 13-17 years, less likely to occur among children with co-occurring psychiatric conditions, and were more likely to co-occur with injury. We discussed some unique challenges for managing children with both ASD and epilepsy.
An exploratory longitudinal study of social and language outcomes in children with autism in bilingual home environments.Little is known about outcomes of early intervention for children with autism spectrum disorder reared in bilingual homes. There are concerns that social communication deficits among children with autism spectrum disorder may reduce the developmental benefits of early intervention for children with autism spectrum disorder raised in bilingual environments. We conducted an exploratory analysis of cross-sectional and longitudinal data from a larger study to explore associations between home language environment and language ability and social skills in response to early autism spectrum disorder intervention. Participants, aged 12-26 months when recruited, were a subset of a larger 2-year, randomized intervention trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00698997). Children from bilingual homes ( n = 13) began intervention with lower gesture use but otherwise demonstrated equal baseline language and social abilities as compared with age and nonverbal IQ-matched children from monolingual homes ( n = 24). Significant language growth was exhibited by children from both language groups and there was no moderating effect of home language environment. The bilingual home group demonstrated increased gesture use over the course of intervention as compared with the monolingual home group. Preliminary data revealed no basis for concerns regarding negative impact of a bilingual home environment on language or social development in young children with autism spectrum disorder.
Autism spectrum disorder: Consensus guidelines on assessment, treatment and research from the British Association for Psychopharmacology.An expert review of the aetiology, assessment, and treatment of autism spectrum disorder, and recommendations for diagnosis, management and service provision was coordinated by the British Association for Psychopharmacology, and evidence graded. The aetiology of autism spectrum disorder involves genetic and environmental contributions, and implicates a number of brain systems, in particular the gamma-aminobutyric acid, serotonergic and glutamatergic systems. The presentation of autism spectrum disorder varies widely and co-occurring health problems (in particular epilepsy, sleep disorders, anxiety, depression, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and irritability) are common. We did not recommend the routine use of any pharmacological treatment for the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder. In children, melatonin may be useful to treat sleep problems, dopamine blockers for irritability, and methylphenidate, atomoxetine and guanfacine for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The evidence for use of medication in adults is limited and recommendations are largely based on extrapolations from studies in children and patients without autism spectrum disorder. We discuss the conditions for considering and evaluating a trial of medication treatment, when non-pharmacological interventions should be considered, and make recommendations on service delivery. Finally, we identify key gaps and limitations in the current evidence base and make recommendations for future research and the design of clinical trials.
LINE-1 retrotransposons in healthy and diseased human brain.Long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) is a transposable element with the ability to self-mobilize throughout the human genome. The L1 elements found in the human brain is hypothesized to date back 56 million years ago and has survived evolution, currently accounting for 17% of the human genome. L1 retrotransposition has been theorized to contribute to somatic mosaicism. This review focuses on the presence of L1 in the healthy and diseased human brain, such as in autism spectrum disorders. Throughout this exploration, we will discuss the impact L1 has on neurological disorders that can occur throughout the human lifetime. With this, we hope to better understand the complex role of L1 in the human brain development and its implications to human cognition. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Bullying and Identity Development: Insights from Autistic and Non-autistic College Students.Reduced cognitive empathy may put autistic people at risk for bullying. We compared interpretations of bullying provided by 22 autistic and 15 non-autistic college students. Autistic (and non-autistic) students reported less severe bullying in college relative to earlier in development. Chronic bullying was associated with improvements in self-descriptions and self-acceptance. Autistic students who were chronically bullied were more likely to self-identify as autistic when asked to explain their disability. Autistic and non-autistic students demonstrated similar levels of cognitive empathy, providing no evidence that a "double empathy problem" contributes to bullying for all autistic individuals. Findings suggest that recovery from bullying can contribute to resilience and that autistic people gain insights about bullying and how to overcome it with development.
Autism and Accommodations in Higher Education: Insights from the Autism Community.This article builds on the growing body of research on higher education for autistic students by soliciting input from autistic adults on their higher education experiences and suggestions on making these experiences more 'autism-friendly'. Sixty-six individuals participated in a national exploratory survey and thirty-one participated in follow-up, online focus groups. The article reviews the accommodations individuals received and the accommodations they would have liked to receive. Concrete strategies are provided for institutes of higher education to address the social and sensory needs of autistic students, areas many participants reported being neglected in their academic experience, such as mentors and a neurodiverse space. These suggestions are intended to complement traditional academic accommodations to improve the outcomes of autistic students.
The Autism-Tics, ADHD and other Comorbidities inventory (A-TAC): previous and predictive validity.Reliable and easy to administer screening instruments focusing on neurodevelopmental disorders and associated conditions are scarce. The Autism-Tics, AD/HD and other Comorbidities inventory (A-TAC) has previously been validated and reporting good- excellent validity for several disorders. This article aims to expand these findings by including more conditions in a substantially larger sample augmented with the Swedish National Patient Register (NPR).
Identifying Autism with a Brief and Low-Cost Screening Instrument-OERA: Construct Validity, Invariance Testing, and Agreement Between Judges.Simple and low-cost observational-tools to detect symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are still necessary. The OERA is a new assessment tool to screen children eliciting observable behaviors with no substantial knowledge on ASD required. The sample was 99 children aged 3-10: 76 with ASD and 23 without ASD (11/23 had intellectual disability). The 13 remained items exhibited high interrater agreement and high reliability loaded onto a single latent trait. Such model showed excellent fit indices evaluated via confirmatory factor analysis and no item showed differential function in terms of age/sex/IQ. A cutoff of five points or higher resulted in the highest sensitivity (92.75) and specificity (90.91) percentages. OERA is a brief, stable, low-cost standardized observational-screening to identify ASD children.
Action simulation and mirroring in children with autism spectrum disorders.Mental imitation, perhaps a precursor to motor imitation, involves visual perspective-taking and motor imagery. Research on mental imitation in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has been rather limited compared to that on motor imitation. The main objective of this fMRI study is to determine the differences in brain responses underlying mirroring and mentalizing networks during mental imitation in children and adolescents with ASD. Thirteen high-functioning children and adolescents with ASD and 15 age-and- IQ-matched typically developing (TD) control participants took part in this fMRI study. In the MRI scanner, participants were shown cartoon pictures of people performing everyday actions (Transitive actions: e.g., ironing clothes but with the hand missing; and Intransitive actions: e.g., clapping hands with the palms missing) and were asked to identify which hand or palm orientation would best fit the gap. The main findings are: 1) both groups performed equally while processing transitive and intransitive actions; 2) both tasks yielded activation in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) in ASD and TD groups; 3) Increased activation was seen in ASD children, relative to TD, in left ventral premotor and right middle temporal gyrus during intransitive actions; and 4) ASD symptom severity positively correlated with activation in left parietal, right middle temporal, and right premotor regions across all subjects. Overall, our findings suggest that regions mediating mirroring may be recruiting more brain resources in ASD and may have implications for understanding social movement through modeling.
International Survey of Speech-Language Pathologists' Practices in Working with Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental impairment. To better understand the role of speech-language pathologists (SLPs) in different countries in supporting children with ASD, the International Association of Logopedics and Phoniatrics (IALP) Child Language Committee developed a survey for SLPs working with children or adolescents with ASD. Method and Participants: The survey comprised 58 questions about background information of respondents, characteristics of children with ASD, and the role of SLPs in diagnosis, assessment, and intervention practices. The survey was available in English, French, Russian, and Portuguese, and distributed online.
Stimulation of Executive Functions as Part of the Language Intervention Process in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.Identifying effective methods for stimulating language and communication of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is fundamental to the effective use of available resources to support these children. This pilot study was designed to explore the potential benefits of a program of stimulation of executive functions (SEF) on the functional aspects of language and communication through the assessment of the functional communicative profile and social-cognitive performance.
The Home Literacy Environment of Preschool-Age Children with Autism or Down Syndrome.This exploratory study investigated if there were differences in the home literacy environment of preschool children on the autism spectrum and preschool children with Down syndrome to determine if the home literacy environment may potentially be associated with strengths or weaknesses in children's social communication skills.
Differentiating Autism from Typical Development: Preliminary Findings of Greek Versions of a Pragmatic Language and Social Communication Questionnaire.A social pragmatic communication disorder is one of the primary characteristics of children with autism. Although several measures of pragmatics and social communication exist, many are not comprehensive, do not examine the quality of interactions across contexts and interlocutors, and cannot be easily administered and interpreted. The aim of this article is to report on preliminary data collected using the Greek version of comprehensive social communication and pragmatic language questionnaires completed by parents and teachers interacting with young children in different contexts.
Development of Emotion Self-Regulation Among Young Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders: The Role of Parents.Emotional self-regulation (ESR) challenges are well-documented in the diagnostic profiles of children with Autism; however, less is known about the development of ESR and the role of parents in ESR development for this population. Thirty-seven young children with autism and one of their parents participated in a home-based, observational study exploring the associations between the children's social communication and sensory processing characteristics and their parents' behaviors associated with ESR development. Findings revealed that parent use of physical and language behaviors were associated with child social communication abilities. No associations between child sensory processing and parent behaviors were found. Understanding the interactive processes between parents and children with ASD has implications for the development of parent-based interventions that increase child ESR.
Autism: Hard to Switch from Details to the Whole.It has long been proposed that individuals with autism exhibit a superior processing of details at the expense of an impaired global processing. This theory has received some empirical support, but results are mixed. In this research we have studied local and global processing in ASD and Typically Developing children, with an adaptation of the Navon task, designed to measure congruency effects between local and global stimuli and switching cost between local and global tasks. ASD children showed preserved global processing; however, compared to Typically Developing children, they exhibited more facilitation from congruent local stimuli when they performed the global task. In addition, children with ASD had more switching cost than Typically Developing children only when they switched from the local to the global task, reflecting a specific difficulty to disengage from local stimuli. Together, results suggest that ASD is characterized by a tendency to process local details, they benefit from the processing of local stimuli at the expense of increasing cost to disengage from local stimuli when global processing is needed. Thus, this work demonstrates experimentally the advantages and disadvantages of the increased local processing in children with ASD.
De novo variants in KLF7 are a potential novel cause of developmental delay/intellectual disability, neuromuscular and psychiatric symptoms.Due to small numbers of reported patients with pathogenic variants in single genes, the phenotypic spectrum associated with genes causing neurodevelopmental disorders such as intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder is expanding. Among these genes is KLF7 (Krüppel-like factor 7), which is located at 2q33.3 and has been implicated in several developmental processes. KLF7 has been proposed to be a candidate gene for the phenotype of autism features seen in patients with a 2q33.3q34 deletion. Herein, we report 4 unrelated individuals with de novo KLF7 missense variants who share similar clinical features of developmental delay/ID, hypotonia, feeding/swallowing issues, psychiatric features and neuromuscular symptoms, and add to the knowledge about the phenotypic spectrum associated with KLF7 haploinsufficiency.
Brief Report: Improving Social Outcomes for Students with Autism at Recess Through Peer-Mediated Pivotal Response Training.Many students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) struggle to appropriately interact and play with their peers at recess. In this pilot feasibility study, we tested the efficacy of practitioner-implemented, peer-mediated Pivotal Response Training (PRT) with 11 elementary and middle school students with ASD. Participants were randomly assigned to a treatment or control group. We measured outcomes at multiple time points, and analyzed data using multi-level modeling with time nested within student. We demonstrated large and statistically significant increases in peer interaction (d = 1.13). Appropriate play with peers also increased substantially (d = 0.89). Practitioners and students provided positive feedback. These findings suggest school staff can feasibly facilitate peer-implemented PRT that improves social outcomes for students with ASD at recess.
Using Mobile Technology to Reduce Engagement in Stereotypy: A Validation of Decision-Making Algorithms.We developed an iOS app, the iSTIM, designed to support parents of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in reducing common repetitive vocal and motor behavior (i.e., stereotypy). The purpose of our study was to preliminarily test the decision-making algorithms of the iSTIM using trained university students to implement the assessments and interventions. Specifically, we examined the effects of the iSTIM on stereotypy and functional engagement in 11 children with ASD within alternating treatment designs. Using the iSTIM reduced engagement in stereotypy for eight participants and increased functional engagement for four of those participants. Our results indicate that the iSTIM may decrease engagement in stereotypy but that some of the decision-making algorithms may benefit from modifications prior to testing with parents.
Atypical PT anatomy in children with autism spectrum disorder with expressive language deficits.Deficits in communication are a core feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), however, structural language abilities are highly variable, ranging from minimally verbal to superior linguistic skills. Differences in the anatomy of cortical language regions, including anterior and posterior areas, have been found in ASD. It remains unclear, however, if anatomical differences distinguish individuals with impaired expressive language from those without such deficits. In addition, anatomical differences have not been explored in children with extremely low expressive language. This study included 34 boys with ASD, 7-11 years old, including an expressive language impaired group (n = 17) and an average-high language group (n = 17). The language impaired group was subdivided into a low (n = 9) and extremely low (n = 8) language subgroup for exploratory analyses to determine whether children with ASD with extremely low expressive language abilities exhibit distinct anatomy. Gray matter volume of the pars triangularis, pars opercularis, and planum temporale (PT) were measured on MRIs. PT volume was smaller in the ASD group with expressive language impairment relative to those without language deficits. The right PT volume was also positively correlated with language scores. The exploratory analyses revealed differences in the left PT, with smaller volume in the extremely low language subgroup, relative to the average and moderately low language groups. Results suggest that smaller PT volumes in both hemispheres are associated with severe language impairments in ASD. The PT may therefore, be a biomarker of language outcome in young children with ASD, with more studies of PT anatomy necessary.
Integrated Bayesian analysis of rare exonic variants to identify risk genes for schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental disorders.Integrating rare variation from trio family and case-control studies has successfully implicated specific genes contributing to risk of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) including autism spectrum disorders (ASD), intellectual disability (ID), developmental disorders (DDs), and epilepsy (EPI). For schizophrenia (SCZ), however, while sets of genes have been implicated through the study of rare variation, only two risk genes have been identified.
Advantages and Challenges of a Home- and Clinic-Based Model of Behavioral Intervention for Individuals Diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder.Researchers have demonstrated that comprehensive behavioral intervention can result in significant improvements in the lives of individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD; e.g.; Lovaas, Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology 55(1):3-9, 1987; McEachin et al., American Journal of Mental Retardation 97(4):359-372, 1993). This intervention has occurred in a variety of settings (e.g., school, home, and clinic). Even though procedures based upon the principles of applied behavior analysis (ABA) can be implemented across a variety of settings, there is often confusion about the differences and relative advantages of home- versus clinic-based settings. The purpose of this paper is to provide a discussion of home- and clinic-based intervention within the context of a progressive approach to ABA and discus possible advantages of each type of setting.
Vitamin A Deficiency Induces Autistic-Like Behaviors in Rats by Regulating the RARβ-CD38-Oxytocin Axis in the Hypothalamus.Vitamin A (VA) is an essential nutrient for the development of the brain. We previously found that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have a significant rate of VA deficiency (VAD). In the current study, we aim to determine whether VAD is a risk factor for the generation of autistic-like behaviors via the transcription factor retinoic acid receptor beta (RARβ)-regulated cluster of differentiation 38 (CD38)-oxytocin (OXT) axis.
Multimodal approaches to functional connectivity in autism spectrum disorders: An integrative perspective.Atypical functional connectivity has been implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). However, the literature to date has been largely inconsistent, with mixed and conflicting reports of hypo- and hyper-connectivity. These discrepancies are partly due to differences between various neuroimaging modalities. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) measure distinct indices of functional connectivity (e.g., blood-oxygenation level-dependent [BOLD] signal vs. electrical activity). Furthermore, each method has unique benefits and disadvantages with respect to spatial and temporal resolution, vulnerability to specific artifacts, and practical implementation. Thus far, functional connectivity research on ASDs has remained almost exclusively unimodal; therefore, interpreting findings across modalities remains a challenge. Multimodal integration of fMRI, EEG, and MEG data is critical in resolving discrepancies in the literature, and working toward a unifying framework for interpreting past and future findings. This review aims to provide a theoretical foundation for future multimodal research on ASDs. First, we will discuss the merits and shortcomings of several popular theories in ASD functional connectivity research, using examples from the literature to date. Next, the neurophysiological relationships between imaging modalities, including their relationship with invasive neural recordings, will be reviewed. Finally, methodological approaches to multimodal data integration will be presented, and their future application to ASDs will be discussed. Analyses relating transient patterns of neural activity ("states") are particularly promising. This strategy provides a comparable measure across modalities, captures complex spatiotemporal patterns, and is a natural extension of recent dynamic fMRI research in ASDs. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

[Tools and techniques to improve the oral health of children with autism].Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a life-long heterogeneous psychiatric disorder, characterized by impaired social interaction and communication, and the presence of repetitive and stereotyped behaviors as well as restricted interests. These features have an impact on the oral health of these individuals: high risk of dental caries, poorer periodontal status, and bruxism are often described. Children with ASD often provide limited collaboration with medical procedures, particularly those considered invasive such as dental care. Children with ASD are prone to agitation, self-injury, and emotional dysregulation; they can also present hypersensitivity to sensory input. These features make it difficult for professionals to examine and treat children with ASD; they interfere with dental care and constitute a barrier to it. Most of them are treated under general anesthesia or sedation. Therefore, children with ASD present a challenge for the dental community. Adapted and specific strategies are required to allow individuals with ASD to go beyond the barriers of dental care. Different tools and techniques of evidence-based practice can be considered: visual pedagogy, behavioral approaches, and numeric devices can be used. Pediatricians have a key role in the oral care of children with autism. The aim of this article is to present the oral health associated with ASD, to set out the possible ways to improve oral health, to enable the practitioner to detect problems, to raise awareness, and to help patients and their families in their care pathway.
Sparsifying machine learning models identify stable subsets of predictive features for behavioral detection of autism.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis can be delayed due in part to the time required for administration of standard exams, such as the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS). Shorter and potentially mobilized approaches would help to alleviate bottlenecks in the healthcare system. Previous work using machine learning suggested that a subset of the behaviors measured by ADOS can achieve clinically acceptable levels of accuracy. Here we expand on this initial work to build sparse models that have higher potential to generalize to the clinical population.
Visual Motion Prediction and Verbal False Memory Performance in Autistic Children.Recent theoretical accounts propose that atypical predictive processing can explain the diverse cognitive and behavioral features associated with autism, and that difficulties in making predictions may be related to reduced contextual processing. In this pre-registered study, 30 autistic children aged 6-14 years and 30 typically developing children matched in age and non-verbal IQ completed visual extrapolation and false memory tasks to assess predictive abilities and contextual processing, respectively. In the visual extrapolation tasks, children were asked to predict when an occluded car would reach the end of a road and when an occluded set of lights would fill up a grid. Autistic children made predictions that were just as precise as those made by typically developing children, across a range of occlusion durations. In the false memory task, autistic and typically developing children did not differ significantly in their discrimination between items presented in a list and semantically related, non-presented items, although the data were insensitive, suggesting the need for larger samples. Our findings help to refine theoretical accounts by challenging the notion that autism is caused by pervasively disordered prediction abilities. Further studies will be required to assess the relationship between predictive processing and context use in autism, and to establish the conditions under which predictive processing may be impaired.

Chorioamnionitis, IL-17A, and fetal origins of neurologic disease.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 1 in 323 infants have cerebral palsy. Highly correlated to intrauterine infection and inflammation, the incidence of cerebral palsy has remained constant over the last few decades despite significant advances in neonatal intensive care including improved ventilator techniques, surfactant therapy, maternal steroid administration, and use of intrapartum empiric antimicrobials. Recent advances in our understanding of immune responses to infection and inflammation have identified the cytokine IL-17A as a crucial component of early proinflammatory mediators that cause brain injury associated with neurologic impairment. Remarkably, maternal inflammatory responses to in utero inflammation and infection can also lead to potentially debilitating neurologic conditions in the offspring, which often become clinically apparent during childhood and/or early adulthood. This review details the role of IL-17A in fetal and maternal proinflammatory responses that lead to fetal brain injury and neurologic sequelae, including cerebral palsy. Recent findings regarding the role of maternal inflammatory responses in the development of childhood and adult neurologic conditions, such as autism, schizophrenia, and multiple sclerosis, will also be highlighted.
iTRAQ-Based Proteomic Analysis Reveals Protein Profile in Plasma from Children with Autism.Autism is a childhood neurological disorder with poorly understood etiology and pathology. This study is designed to identify differentially expressed proteins that might serve as potential biomarkers for autism.
Subtyping cognitive profiles in Autism Spectrum Disorder using a Functional Random Forest algorithm.DSM-5 Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) comprises a set of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by deficits in social communication and interaction and repetitive behaviors or restricted interests, and may both affect and be affected by multiple cognitive mechanisms. This study attempts to identify and characterize cognitive subtypes within the ASD population using our Functional Random Forest (FRF) machine learning classification model. This model trained a traditional random forest model on measures from seven tasks that reflect multiple levels of information processing. 47 ASD diagnosed and 58 typically developing (TD) children between the ages of 9 and 13 participated in this study. Our RF model was 72.7% accurate, with 80.7% specificity and 63.1% sensitivity. Using the random forest model, the FRF then measures the proximity of each subject to every other subject, generating a distance matrix between participants. This matrix is then used in a community detection algorithm to identify subgroups within the ASD and TD groups, and revealed 3 ASD and 4 TD putative subgroups with unique behavioral profiles. We then examined differences in functional brain systems between diagnostic groups and putative subgroups using resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rsfcMRI). Chi-square tests revealed a significantly greater number of between group differences (p < .05) within the cingulo-opercular, visual, and default systems as well as differences in inter-system connections in the somato-motor, dorsal attention, and subcortical systems. Many of these differences were primarily driven by specific subgroups suggesting that our method could potentially parse the variation in brain mechanisms affected by ASD.
ANKRD11 associated with intellectual disability and autism regulates dendrite differentiation via the BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway.Haploinsufficiency of ANKRD11 due to deletion or truncation mutations causes KBG syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and craniofacial abnormalities. However, little is known about the neurobiological role of ANKRD11 during brain development. Here we show that ANKRD11 regulates pyramidal neuron migration and dendritic differentiation in the developing mouse cerebral cortex. Using an in utero manipulation approach, we found that Ankrd11 knockdown delayed radial migration of cortical neurons. ANKRD11-deficient neurons displayed markedly reduced dendrite growth and branching as well as abnormal dendritic spine morphology. Ankrd11 knockdown suppressed acetylation of epigenetic molecules such as p53 and Histone H3. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of Trkb, Bdnf, and neurite growth-related genes were downregulated in ANKRD11-deficient cortical neurons. The Trkb promoter region was largely devoid of acetylated Histone H3 and p53, and was instead occupied with MeCP2 and DNMT1. Overexpression of TrkB rescued abnormal dendrite growth in these cells. Our findings demonstrate a novel role for ANKRD11 in neuron differentiation during brain development and suggest an epigenetic modification as a potential key molecular feature underlying KBG syndrome.
Differences in fecal microbial metabolites and microbiota of children with autism spectrum disorders.Evidence supporting that gut problems are linked to ASD symptoms has been accumulating both in humans and animal models of ASD. Gut microbes and their metabolites may be linked not only to GI problems but also to ASD behavior symptoms. Despite this high interest, most previous studies have looked mainly at microbial structure, and studies on fecal metabolites are rare in the context of ASD. Thus, we aimed to detect fecal metabolites that may be present at significantly different concentrations between 21 children with ASD and 23 neurotypical children and to investigate its possible link to human gut microbiome. Using
Analysis of Evidence-Based Autism Symptoms Enhancement by Acupuncture.Autism is considered as a complex developmental disability that appears during the first two years of life. It is considered as a neurological disorder that affects brain function leading to impaired development in social interaction and communication skills. Some clinical trials demonstrated that certain acupuncture points play relatively significant role in improving both signs and symptoms of this disease. Owing to limited information available about acupuncture point's combination and protocols, the present study aimed to explore the most frequently used acupuncture points and their channels for children with autism. Thirteen articles about autism enhancement were selected from 2007 to 2015. Acupoints and their channels used in these articles were analyzed according to usage frequencies. The present study identified the following main channels that contribute to autism symptoms enhancement along with the corresponding points' frequencies: Governing Vessel channel (12), Gall bladder channel (9), Kidney channel (8), Pericardium channel (7), Extra points channel (7), Liver channel (7), Heart channel (6), Conception vessel channel (6), and Bladder channel (6). On the other hand, the frequency of each corresponding acupuncture points are EX-HN1 (5), GV-17 (4), PC-6 (4), LR-3 (3), KI-3 (3), HT-7 (3), Lu-9 (3), GV-20 (2), GV-24 (2), GV-24.5 (2), GB-13(2), GB-19 (2), KI-4 (2), LR-4 (2), ST-36 (2), SP-3 (2), SP-6 (2). In conclusion, the consensus is that both channels and points may have an important role in autism symptoms enhancement. Based on the present study, the specific channels and points selection and stimulation types need further investigation through clinical trials.
Transdiagnostic deviant facial recognition for implicit negative emotion in autism and schizophrenia.Impaired facial affect recognition (FAR) is observed in schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and has been linked to amygdala and fusiform gyrus dysfunction. ASD patient's impairments seem to be more pronounced during implicit rather than explicit FAR, whereas for schizophrenia data are inconsistent. However, there are no studies comparing both patient groups in an identical design. The aim of this three-group study was to identify (i) whether FAR alterations are equally present in both groups, (ii) whether they are present rather during implicit or explicit FAR, (iii) and whether they are conveyed by similar or disorder-specific neural mechanisms. Using fMRI, we investigated neural activation during explicit and implicit negative and neutral FAR in 33 young-adult individuals with ASD, 20 subjects with paranoid-schizophrenia and 25 IQ- and gender-matched controls individuals. Differences in activation patterns between each clinical group and controls, respectively were found exclusively for implicit FAR in amygdala and fusiform gyrus. In addition, the ASD group additionally showed reduced activations in medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), bilateral dorso-lateral PFC, ventro-lateral PFC, posterior-superior temporal sulcus and left temporo-parietal junction. Although subjects with ASD showed more widespread altered activation patterns, a direct comparison between both patient groups did not show disorder-specific deficits in neither patient group. In summary, our findings are consistent with a common neural deficit during implicit negative facial affect recognition in schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders.
Sensory Behaviors in Minimally Verbal Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder: How and When Do Caregivers Respond?Sensory behaviors are widely reported in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the impact of these behaviors on families remains largely unknown. This study explored how caregivers of minimally verbal children with ASD responded to their child's sensory behaviors. Using a mixed-methods approach, we examined two variables for each endorsed child behavior: (1) Did the caregiver respond/try to change the behavior? and (2) What response did they employ? Caregivers did not differ in the frequency of responses to hypo- or hyper-responsive behaviors but employed different responses. Caregivers responded to more social sensory behaviors and predominately changed their own behavior in response to their child's. Our findings demonstrate how extensively caregivers adapt to their child's behaviors and vary their response dependent on behavior exhibited.
Herbal Medicine as an Alternative Treatment in Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Systematic Review.This review focuses on the efficacy and safety of herbal medicines in the management of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in humans and animals.
Comprehensive Management of Autism: Current Evidence.Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication, and restricted repetitive behavior. The goals of treatment are to target core behaviors, improve social interactions and communication, and reduce disruptive behavior. The present paper discusses the role of applied behavioral analysis and pharmacotherapy.
Systemic inflammation in asocial BTBR TAutistic Spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurobehavioral disorder characterized by defects in communication skills leading to restricted sociability. ASD has immense dysregulation in immune responses which is thought to affect neuronal system and thus behavior. ASD patients and BTBR T
Evaluation and remediation of central auditory processing disorders in children with autism spectrum disorders.This study was carried out to assess various skills of central auditory processing (CAP) in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and to evaluate the efficacy of auditory training in these children.
The TBR1-related autistic-spectrum-disorder phenotype and its clinical spectrum.A diverse range of genetic aberrations can lead to Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and many of these have been identified via Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) as part of large scale consortium studies. ASD is a phenotypically variable disorder and detailed clinical descriptions are essential to appreciate genotype-phenotype relationships. In this report, we provide a comprehensive clinical description of a child with ASD in whom a TBR1 variant was identified. We review this case in the context of the current TBR1 literature and highlight the variable spectrum of disease associated with this gene. The phenotypic information outlined within the literature is incomplete, exemplifying the limitations of massively-parallel sequencing studies with regards to clinical annotation. We suggest that future reporting of ASD variants should include standardised phenotypic descriptions. This would develop a more thorough understanding of genotype-phenotype relationship, so allowing us to better counsel and support our patients.
DHA Mitigates Autistic Behaviors Accompanied by Dopaminergic Change in a Gene/Prenatal Stress Mouse Model.Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is characterized by impairments in social interaction, social communication, and repetitive and stereotyped behaviors. Recent work has begun to explore gene × environmental interactions in the etiology of ASD. We previously reported that prenatal stress exposure in stress-susceptible heterozygous serotonin transporter (SERT) KO pregnant dams in a mouse model resulted in autism-like behavior in the offspring (SERT/S mice). The association between prenatal stress and ASD appears to be affected by maternal SERT genotype in clinical populations as well. Using the mouse model, we examined autistic-like behaviors in greater detail, and additionally explored whether diet supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) may mitigate the behavioral changes. Only male SERT/S mice showed social impairment and stereotyped behavior, and DHA supplementation ameliorated some of these behaviors. We also measured monoamine levels in the SERT/S mice after three treatment paradigms: DHA-rich diet continuously from breeding (DHA diet), DHA-rich diet only after weaning (CTL/DHA diet) and control diet only (CTL diet). The dopamine (DA) content in the striatum was significantly increased in the SERT/S mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice, whereas no difference was observed with noradrenaline and serotonin content. Moreover, DA content in the striatum was significantly reduced in the SERT/S mice with the DHA-rich diet provided continuously from breeding. The results indicate that autism-associated behaviors and changes in the dopaminergic system in this setting can be mitigated with DHA supplementation.
Identification of the antigenic epitopes of maternal autoantibodies in autism spectrum disorders.Several groups have described the presence of fetal brain-reactive maternal autoantibodies in the plasma of some mothers whose children have autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We previously identified seven autoantigens targeted by these maternal autoantibodies, each of which is expressed at significant levels in the developing brain and has demonstrated roles in typical neurodevelopment. To further understand the binding repertoire of the maternal autoantibodies, as well as the presence of any meaningful differences with respect to the recognition and binding of these ASD-specific autoantibodies to each of these neuronal autoantigens, we utilized overlapping peptide microarrays incubated with maternal plasma samples obtained from the Childhood Autism Risk from Genetics and Environment (CHARGE) Study. In an effort to identify the most commonly recognized (immunodominant) epitope sequences targeted by maternal autoantibodies for each of the seven ASD-specific autoantigens, arrays were screened with plasma from mothers with children across diagnostic groups (ASD and typically developing (TD)) that were positive for at least one antigen by western blot (N = 67) or negative control mothers unreactive to any of the autoantigens (N = 18). Of the 63 peptides identified with the discovery microarrays, at least one immunodominant peptide was successfully identified for each of the seven antigenic proteins using subsequent selective screening microarrays. Furthermore, while limited by our relatively small sample size, there were peptides that were distinctly recognized by autoantibodies relative to diagnosis For example, reactivity was observed exclusively in mothers of children of ASD towards several peptides, including the LDH-B peptides DCIIIVVSNPVDILT (9.1% ASD vs. 0% TD; odds ratio (95% CI) = 6.644 (0.355-124.384)) and PVAEEEATVPNNKIT (5.5% ASD vs. 0% TD; odds ratio (95% CI) = 4.067 (0.203-81.403)).These results suggest that there are differences in the binding repertoire between the antigen positive ASD and TD maternal samples. Further, the autoantibodies in plasma from mothers of children with ASD bound to a more diverse set of peptides, and there were specific peptide binding combinations observed only in this group. Future studies are underway to determine the critical amino acids necessary for autoantibody binding, which will be essential in developing a potential therapeutic strategy for maternal autoantibody related (MAR) ASD.
Alexithymia, depression and anxiety in parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorder: Comparative study of autistic disorder, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder.Recent studies have shown that individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders and their relatives have problems expressing and recognizing emotions, but there is a lack of studies on alexithymia, and the relationship between parental alexithymia and depression-anxiety symptoms in these groups. The aim of this study was therefore to measure alexithymia, depression, and anxiety levels in parents of children with pervasive developmental disorders and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and determine whether there is a positive correlation between the child's neurodevelopmental problem severity and parent scores.
Mitochondrial Etiology of Neuropsychiatric Disorders.The brain has the highest mitochondrial energy demand of any organ. Therefore, subtle changes in mitochondrial energy production will preferentially affect the brain. Considerable biochemical evidence has accumulated revealing mitochondrial defects associated with neuropsychiatric diseases. Moreover, the mitochondrial genome encompasses over a thousand nuclear DNA genes plus hundreds to thousands of copies of the maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Therefore, partial defects in either the nuclear DNA or mtDNA genes or combinations of the two can be sufficient to cause neuropsychiatric disorders. Inherited and acquired mtDNA mutations have recently been associated with autism spectrum disorder, which parallels previous evidence of mtDNA variation in other neurological diseases. Therefore, mitochondrial dysfunction may be central to the etiology of a wide spectrum of neurological diseases. The mitochondria and the nucleus communicate to coordinate energy production and utilization, providing the potential for therapeutics by manipulating nuclear regulation of mitochondrial gene expression.
Neurodevelopmental disorders in prison inmates: comorbidity and combined associations with psychiatric symptoms and behavioural disturbance.The identification and management of inmates with neurodevelopmental disorders (ND) has been insufficiently addressed in the literature. We estimated the proportion of cases with Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Intellectual disability (ID) in prison, their comorbidity, and associations with disruptive behaviours and with psychiatric symptoms. Further, we examined the role of coexisting ND on psychiatric symptoms and attitudes toward violence. All 390 male inmates underwent an assessment that included the Diagnostic Interview for ADHD in Adults 2.0, the Autism Quotient, the Learning Disability Screening Questionnaire, the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), and measures of disruptive behaviours and attitudes towards violence. The percentage of cases with ADHD, ASD and ID were 25%, 9% and 9%. Inmates with ADHD and those with ID had significantly higher levels of disruptive behaviours. The combined ADHD/ASD group had significantly higher scores on global severity symptoms than either ADHD or ASD only. Meanwhile, the combined ADHD/ID group had significantly higher scores of behavioural disturbance than the ADHD-only group. Our findings show the extent of ND in prison, their inter-relations and associations with further mental health problems. Vulnerabilities conferred by ND within the criminal justice system should be addressed via interventions and preventative strategies.
Epilepsy in patients with autism: links, risks and treatment challenges.Autism is more common in people with epilepsy, approximately 20%, and epilepsy is more common in people with autism with reported rates of approximately 20%. However, these figures are likely to be affected by the current broader criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which have contributed to an increased prevalence of autism, with the result that the rate for ASD in epilepsy is likely to be higher and the figure for epilepsy in ASD is likely to be lower. Some evidence suggests that there are two peaks of epilepsy onset in autism, in infancy and adolescence. The rate of autism in epilepsy is much higher in those with intellectual disability. In conditions such as the Landau-Kleffner syndrome and nonconvulsive status epilepticus, the epilepsy itself may present with autistic features. There is no plausible mechanism for autism causing epilepsy, however. The co-occurrence of autism and epilepsy is almost certainly the result of underlying factors predisposing to both conditions, including both genetic and environmental factors. Conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety and sleep disorders are common in both epilepsy and autism. Epilepsy is generally not a contraindication to treating these conditions with suitable medication, but it is important to take account of relevant drug interactions. One of the greatest challenges in autism is to determine why early childhood regression occurs in perhaps 25%. Further research should focus on finding the cause for such regression. Whether epilepsy plays a role in the regression of a subgroup of children with autism who lose skills remains to be determined.
Impaired Value Learning for Faces in Preschoolers With Autism Spectrum Disorder.One of the common findings in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is limited selective attention toward social objects, such as faces. Evidence from both human and nonhuman primate studies suggests that selection of objects for processing is guided by the appraisal of object values. We hypothesized that impairments in selective attention in ASD may reflect a disruption of a system supporting learning about object values in the social domain.
Second Version of Google Glass as a Wearable Socio-Affective Aid: Positive School Desirability, High Usability, and Theoretical Framework in a Sample of Children with Autism.Computerized smartglasses are being developed as an assistive technology for daily activities in children and adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). While smartglasses may be able to help with educational and behavioral needs, their usability and acceptability in children with ASD is largely unknown. There have been reports of negative social perceptions surrounding smartglasses use in mainstream populations, a concern given that assistive technologies may already carry their own stigma. Children with ASD may also have a range of additional behavioral, developmental, and social challenges when asked to use this emerging technology in school and home settings.
Decreased plasma agmatine levels in autistic subjects.Agmatine is a polyamine endogenously synthesized from arginine and is considered to be a new neurotransmitter. Agmatine has been implicated in the pathophysiology of several diseases such as anxiety disorder, depression, and schizophrenia. Agmatine also possesses anticonvulsant, neuroprotective, antiapoptotic, antioxidant, anxiolytic, and antidepressant effects. Furthermore, agmatine inhibits the nitric oxide synthase enzyme and exerts antagonist effects on NMDA, alpha-2, and imidazoline receptors. Considering these characteristics, the present study investigated whether agmatine plays a role in the pathogenesis of autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs). Therefore, plasma agmatine levels were evaluated in 34 patients with ASD and 28 non-ASD controls. Plasma agmatine levels were measured using the HPLC method. The study found remarkably lower agmatine levels in patients with ASD compared with the non-ASD control group (p < 0.001). These findings support the notion that agmatine might contribute to the pathogenesis of ASD and may serve as a new target for treatment.
A de novo nonsense mutation in Two sisters (ages 16 yr and 15 yr) have been followed by our clinical genetics team for several years. Both girls have severe intellectual disability, hypotonia, seizures, and distinctive craniofacial features. The parents are healthy and have no other children. Oligo array, fragile X testing, and numerous single-gene tests were negative. All four family members underwent research exome sequencing, which revealed a heterozygous nonsense mutation in
What can autism teach us about the role of sensorimotor systems in higher cognition? New clues from studies on language, action semantics, and abstract emotional concept processing.Within the neurocognitive literature there is much debate about the role of the motor system in language, social communication and conceptual processing. We suggest, here, that autism spectrum conditions (ASC) may afford an excellent test case for investigating and evaluating contemporary neurocognitive models, most notably a neurobiological theory of action perception integration where widely-distributed cell assemblies linking neurons in action and perceptual brain regions act as the building blocks of many higher cognitive functions. We review a literature of functional motor abnormalities in ASC, following this with discussion of their neural correlates and aberrancies in language development, explaining how these might arise with reference to the typical formation of cell assemblies linking action and perceptual brain regions. This model gives rise to clear hypotheses regarding language comprehension, and we highlight a recent set of studies reporting differences in brain activation and behaviour in the processing of action-related and abstract-emotional concepts in individuals with ASC. At the neuroanatomical level, we discuss structural differences in long-distance frontotemporal and frontoparietal connections in ASC, such as would compromise information transfer between sensory and motor regions. This neurobiological model of action perception integration may shed light on the cognitive and social-interactive symptoms of ASC, building on and extending earlier proposals linking autistic symptomatology to motor disorder and dysfunction in action perception integration. Further investigating the contribution of motor dysfunction to higher cognitive and social impairment, we suggest, is timely and promising as it may advance both neurocognitive theory and the development of new clinical interventions for this population and others characterised by early and pervasive motor disruption.
Subgrouping Autism Based on Symptom Severity Leads to Differences in the Degree of Convergence Between Core Feature Domains.Existing models of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) disagree as to whether the core features should be conceptualized as convergent (related) or divergent (unrelated), and the few previous studies addressing this question have found conflicting results. We examined standardized parent ratings of symptoms from three domains (social, communication, repetitive behaviors) in large samples of typically developing children, children with ASD, and ASD subgroups. Our results suggest that the most evidence for divergence lies in typically developing children and lower severity ASD cases, while more evidence for convergence is found in a subset of cases with more severe impairment on any core feature. These results highlight the importance of subgrouping ASD given the degree of phenotypic heterogeneity present across the autism spectrum.
An Initial Psychometric Evaluation of the Joint Attention Protocol.The goal of this paper is to examine the psychometric properties of a live-coded behavioral measure of joint attention, the Attention-Following and Initiating Joint Attention Protocol (JA Protocol), in order to assist researchers and clinicians in identifying when this measure may meet their joint attention assessment needs. Data from 260 children with autism spectrum disorder, developmental delay, or typical development between the ages of 2 and 12 years were used to evaluate this measure using quality standards for measurement. Overall, the JA Protocol demonstrated good psychometric properties. Recommendations and limitations for use of this measure based on psychometric analysis results are reported.
Immune Abnormalities in Autism Spectrum Disorder-Could They Hold Promise for Causative Treatment?Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by impairments in language and communication development, social behavior, and the occurrence of stereotypic patterns of behavior and interests. Despite substantial speculation about causes of ASD, its exact etiology remains unknown. Recent studies highlight a link between immune dysfunction and behavioral traits. Various immune anomalies, including humoral and cellular immunity along with abnormalities at the molecular level, have been reported. There is evidence of altered immune function both in cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral blood. Several studies hypothesize a role for neuroinflammation in ASD and are supported by brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, as well as evidence of microglial activation. It has been shown that immune abnormalities occur in a substantial number of individuals with ASD. Identifying subgroups with immune system dysregulation and linking specific cellular immunophenotypes to different symptoms would be key to defining a group of patients with immune abnormalities as a major etiology underlying behavioral symptoms. These determinations would provide the opportunity to investigate causative treatments for a defined patient group that may specifically benefit from such an approach. This review summarizes recent insights into immune system dysfunction in individuals with ASD and discusses the potential implications for future therapies.
Altered Brain Cholesterol/Isoprenoid Metabolism in a Rat Model of Autism Spectrum Disorders.Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) present a wide range of symptoms characterized by altered sociability, compromised communication and stereotypic/repetitive behaviors. These symptoms are caused by developmental changes, but the mechanisms remain largely unknown. Some lines of evidence suggest an impairment of the cholesterol/isoprenoid metabolism in the brain as a possible cause, but systematic analyses in rodent models of ASDs are lacking. Prenatal exposure to the antiepileptic drug valproate (VPA) is a risk factor for ASDs in humans and generates a well-established model for the disease in rodents. Here, we studied cholesterol/isoprenoid metabolism in different brain areas of infant, adolescent and adult rats prenatally exposed to VPA. VPA-treated rats present autistic-like symptoms, they show changes in cholesterol/isoprenoid homeostasis in some brain areas, a decreased number of oligodendrocytes and impaired myelination in the hippocampus. Together, our data suggest a relation between brain cholesterol/isoprenoid homeostasis and ASDs.
Exploring multi-level system factors facilitating educator training and implementation of evidence-based practices (EBP): a study protocol.This study examines how system-wide (i.e., region, district, and school) mechanisms such as leadership support, training requirements, structure, collaboration, and education affect the use of evidence-based practices (EBPs) in schools and how this affects the outcomes for students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Despite growing evidence for the positive effects of EBPs for ASD, these practices are not consistently or effectively used in schools. Although special education programs are mandated to use EBPs, there are very few evidence-based methods for selecting, implementing, and sustaining EBPs. Research focuses primarily on teacher training, without attention to contextual factors (e.g., implementation climate, attitudes toward EBPs, resource allocation, and social networks) that may impact outcomes. Using an implementation science framework, this project will prospectively examine relations between system-wide factors and teachers' use of EBPs and student education outcomes.
Modulation of Immunological Pathways in Autistic and Neurotypical Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines by the Enteric Microbiome Metabolite Propionic Acid.Propionic acid (PPA) is a ubiquitous short-chain fatty acid which is a fermentation product of the enteric microbiome and present or added to many foods. While PPA has beneficial effects, it is also associated with human disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). We previously demonstrated that PPA modulates mitochondrial dysfunction differentially in subsets of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from patients with ASD. Specifically, PPA significantly increases mitochondrial function in LCLs that have mitochondrial dysfunction at baseline [individuals with autistic disorder with atypical mitochondrial function (AD-A) LCLs] as compared to ASD LCLs with normal mitochondrial function [individuals with autistic disorder with normal mitochondrial function (AD-N) LCLs] and control (CNT) LCLs. PPA at 1 mM was found to have a minimal effect on expression of immune genes in CNT and AD-N LCLs. However, as hypothesized, Panther analysis demonstrated that 1 mM PPA exposure at 24 or 48 h resulted in significant activation of the immune system genes in AD-A LCLs. When the effect of PPA on ASD LCLs were compared to the CNT LCLs, both ASD groups demonstrated immune pathway activation, although the AD-A LCLs demonstrate a wider activation of immune genes. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified several immune-related pathways as key Canonical Pathways that were differentially regulated, specifically human leukocyte antigen expression and immunoglobulin production genes were upregulated. These data demonstrate that the enteric microbiome metabolite PPA can evoke atypical immune activation in LCLs with an underlying abnormal metabolic state. As PPA, as well as enteric bacteria which produce PPA, have been implicated in a wide variety of diseases which have components of immune dysfunction, including ASD, diabetes, obesity, and inflammatory diseases, insight into this metabolic modulator may have wide applications for both health and disease.
The quality of life of children with severe developmental disabilities.Research examining the quality of life (QoL) of children with severe developmental disabilities (SDD) is limited. The present study examines parent perceptions of child QoL in children with SDD compared with typically developing (TD) children and then examines predictors of QoL for the SDD group.
Relationships between autism spectrum disorder and intolerance of uncertainty.Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is a dispositional risk factor involving maladaptive responding under conditions of uncertainty. Recent data indicate that IU is likely elevated in youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and is positively correlated with anxiety. This study examined whether IU may be associated with ASD independent of anxiety. Relationships between anxiety, ASD, and IU were examined in 57 children with ASD without co-occurring intellectual disability and 32 control participants, ages 7-16 years. Hierarchal linear regressions were run to examine whether ASD variables, including emotion dysregulation, were predictive of IU when controlling for anxiety. Severity of social communication deficits, repetitive behaviors, and emotion dysregulation were each related to IU when controlling for the effects of anxiety. When these variables were entered into the regression model together, emotion dysregulation was the only significant predictor of IU. These findings suggest that IU is directly related to features of ASD possibly due to shared genetic, neurological, or psychological underpinnings.

Acamprosate rescues neuronal defects in the Drosophila model of Fragile X Syndrome.Several off-label studies have shown that acamprosate can provide some clinical benefits in youth with Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), an autism spectrum disorder caused by loss of function of the highly conserved FMR1 gene. This study investigated the ability of acamprosate to rescue cellular, molecular and behavioral defects in the Drosophila model of FXS.
Pitt-Hopkins Syndrome: A Review of Current Literature, Clinical Approach, and 23-Patient Case Series.Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) is a rare, genetic disorder caused by a molecular variant of TCF4 which is involved in embryologic neuronal differentiation. PTHS is characterized by syndromic facies, psychomotor delay, and intellectual disability. Other associated features include early-onset myopia, seizures, constipation, and hyperventilation-apneic spells. Many also meet criteria for autism spectrum disorder. Here the authors present a series of 23 PTHS patients with molecularly confirmed TCF4 variants and describe 3 unique individuals. The first carries a small deletion but does not exhibit the typical facial features nor the typical pattern of developmental delay. The second exhibits typical facial features, but has attained more advanced motor and verbal skills than other reported cases to date. The third displays typical features of PTHS, however inherited a large chromosomal duplication involving TCF4 from his unaffected father with somatic mosaicism. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first chromosomal duplication case reported to date.
The Fast Spiking Subpopulation of Striatal Neurons Coding for Temporal Cognition of Movements. Timing dysfunctions occur in a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders such as Parkinson's disease, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism and attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder. Several lines of evidence show that disrupted timing processing is involved in specific fronto-striatal abnormalities. The striatum encodes reinforcement learning and procedural motion, and consequently is required to represent temporal information precisely, which then guides actions in proper sequence. Previous studies highlighted the temporal scaling property of timing-relevant striatal neurons; however, it is still unknown how this is accomplished over short temporal latencies, such as the sub-seconds to seconds range.
Effect of early natal supplementation of paracetamol on attenuation of exotoxin/endotoxin induced pyrexia and precipitation of autistic like features in albino rats.The present study was aimed to test the hypothesis that paracetamol (PCM) can precipitate autistic like features when used to counteract vaccine-induced fever using experimental rat pups. The pups were treated with measles mumps rubella (MMR) vaccine, diphtheria tetanus and pertussis (DPT) vaccines and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with subsequent PCM treatment. The pups were evaluated for postnatal growth (weight gain, eye opening) and behavior alterations (swimming performance, olfactory discrimination, negative geotaxis, nociception, and locomotor activity) by performing battery of neurobehavioral test. Significant correlation was observed between social behavioral domains (nociception, anxiety and motor coordination) and pro-inflammatory load in the pups when treated with MMR/LPS along with PCM. A significant change in pro and anti-inflammatory (IL-4, IL-6, IL-10) markers were observed in rats treated with PCM, MMR, LPS, DPS alone or in combination with MMR, LPS and DPT (5128.6 ± 0.000, 15,488 ± 0.000
A Cross-Sectional Study of the Association between Infant Hepatitis B Vaccine Exposure in Boys and the Risk of Adverse Effects as Measured by Receipt of Special Education Services.The National Center for Education Statistics reported that between 1990-2005 the number of children receiving special education services (SES) rose significantly, and then, from 2004-2012, the number declined significantly. This coincided with the introduction of Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccine in 1991, and the subsequent introduction of Thimerosal-reduced hepatitis B vaccine in the early 2000s. This study examined the potential relationship between infant exposure to mercury from three doses of Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccine and the risk of boys being adversely affected (as measured by receipt of SES). This cross-sectional study examined 1192 boys (weighted
An examination of the clinical outcomes of adolescents and young adults with broad autism spectrum traits and autism spectrum disorder and anorexia nervosa: A multi centre study.To compare the clinical outcomes of adolescents and young adults with anorexia nervosa (AN) comorbid with broad autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or ASD traits.
Sensitivity to audio-visual synchrony and its relation to language abilities in children with and without ASD.Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is often accompanied by deficits in speech and language processing. Speech processing relies heavily on the integration of auditory and visual information, and it has been suggested that the ability to detect correspondence between auditory and visual signals helps to lay the foundation for successful language development. The goal of the present study was to examine whether young children with ASD show reduced sensitivity to temporal asynchronies in a speech processing task when compared to typically developing controls, and to examine how this sensitivity might relate to language proficiency. Using automated eye tracking methods, we found that children with ASD failed to demonstrate sensitivity to asynchronies of 0.3s, 0.6s, or 1.0s between a video of a woman speaking and the corresponding audio track. In contrast, typically developing children who were language-matched to the ASD group, were sensitive to both 0.6s and 1.0s asynchronies. We also demonstrated that individual differences in sensitivity to audiovisual asynchronies and individual differences in orientation to relevant facial features were both correlated with scores on a standardized measure of language abilities. Results are discussed in the context of attention to visual language and audio-visual processing as potential precursors to language impairment in ASD.

Association of Autism with Maternal Infections, Perinatal and Other Risk Factors: A Case-Control Study.This case-control study explores the association between pregnancy/birth complications and other factors with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in Lebanese subjects aged 2-18 years. Researchers interviewed 136 ASD cases from the American University of Beirut Medical Center Special Kids Clinic, and 178 controls selected by systematic digit dialing in the Greater-Beirut area. Male gender (Adjusted Odds Ratio [95% CI]: 3.9 [2.2-7.0]); postpartum feeding difficulties (2.5 [1.2-5.4]); maternal infections/complications during pregnancy (2.9 [1.5-5.5], 2.1 [1.1-3.9]); consanguinity (2.5 [1.0-6.0]); family history of psychiatric disorders (2.2 [1.1-4.4]) were risk factors for ASD. Being born first/second (0.52 [0.28-0.95]) and maternal psychological support during pregnancy (0.49 [0.27-0.89]) were negatively associated with ASD. Identifying ASD correlates is crucial for instigating timely screening and subsequent early intervention.
Antidepressant use during pregnancy and risk of autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: systematic review of observational studies and methodological considerations.Antidepressant exposure during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in several observational studies. We performed a systematic review of these studies to highlight the effect that important methodological limitations have on such analyses and to consider approaches to the conduct, reporting and interpretation of future studies.
Delivery of Oxytocin to the Brain for the Treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorder by Nasal Application.Oxytocin (OXT) is a cyclic nonapeptide, two amino acids of which are cysteine, forming an intramolecular disulfide bond. OXT is produced in the hypothalamus and is secreted into the bloodstream from the posterior pituitary. As recent studies have suggested that OXT is a neurotransmitter exhibiting central effects important for social deficits, it has drawn much attention as a drug candidate for the treatment of autism. Although human-stage clinical trials of the nasal spray of OXT for the treatment of autism have already begun, few studies have examined the pharmacokinetics and brain distribution of OXT after nasal application. The aim of this study is to evaluate the disposition, nasal absorption, and therapeutic potential of OXT after nasal administration. The pharmacokinetics of OXT after intravenous bolus injection to rats followed a two-compartment model, with a rapid initial half-life of 3 min. The nasal bioavailability of OXT was approximately 2%. The brain concentration of OXT after nasal application was much higher than that after intravenous application, despite much lower concentrations in the plasma. More than 95% of OXT in the brain was directly transported from the nasal cavity. The in vivo stress-relief effect by OXT was observed only after intranasal administration. These results indicate that pharmacologically active OXT was effectively delivered to the brain after intranasal administration. In conclusion, the nasal cavity is a promising route for the efficient delivery of OXT to the brain.
Rapport Building and Instructional Fading Prior to Discrete Trial Instruction: Moving From Child-Led Play to Intensive Teaching.Discrete trial instruction (DTI) is effective for teaching skills to children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although effective, instructional settings can become aversive resulting in avoidant and escape-related behaviors. Given the significant social impairments associated with ASD, interventions that promote social approach and reduce avoidance are warranted. Rapport building or "pairing" the therapist and teaching setting with highly preferred activities prior to instruction can reduce problematic behaviors during subsequent instruction. However, the path from child-led play to DTI is not well established. Instructional fading may assist in bridging this gap. Four participants with ASD who were beginning an intensive behavioral intervention program were included in the current study. Participants progressed through nine stages of pairing and instructional fading with minimal problem behavior and high percentages of in-seat and close proximity to the therapist. Guidelines for incorporating rapport building strategies prior to intensive teaching with children with ASD are proposed.
Propionate enters GABAergic neurons, inhibits GABA transaminase, causes GABA accumulation and lethargy in a model of propionic acidemia.Propionic acidemia is the accumulation of propionate in blood due to dysfunction of propionyl-CoA carboxylase. The condition causes lethargy and striatal degeneration with motor impairment in humans. How propionate exerts its toxic effect is unclear. Here, we show that intravenous administration of propionate causes dose-dependent propionate accumulation in the brain and transient lethargy in mice. Propionate, an inhibitor of histone deacetylase, entered GABAergic neurons, as could be seen from increased neuronal histone H4 acetylation in the striatum and neocortex. Propionate caused an increase in GABA (γ-amino butyric acid) levels in the brain, suggesting inhibition of GABA breakdown.
A case report and literature review of autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in paediatric chronic pain.Psychiatric disorders are common in paediatric patients with chronic pain, but the overall prevalence of comorbid neurodevelopmental disorders is unclear. We report on a case of severe chronic pain in a child with undiagnosed comorbid autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, where significant improvements in pain and function occurred following methylphenidate medication and parental behavioural training.
Prenatal paracetamol exposure and child neurodevelopment: A review.The non-prescription medication paracetamol (acetaminophen, APAP) is currently recommended as a safe pain and fever treatment during pregnancy. However, recent studies suggest a possible association between APAP use in pregnancy and offspring neurodevelopment.
Associations among maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index, gestational weight gain and risk of autism in the Han Chinese population.Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder with an unclear etiology. Pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and gestational weight gain (GWG) have been suggested to play a role in the etiology of autism. The current study explores the associations among maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, GWG and the risk of autism in the Han Chinese population.
Effects of Multimodal Mandala Yoga on Social and Emotional Skills for Youth with Autism Spectrum Disorder: An Exploratory Study.Youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) demonstrates impairment in the ability to socially and emotionally relate to others that can limit participation in groups, interaction with peers, and building successful life relationships.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use in pregnant women; pharmacogenetics, drug-drug interactions and adverse effects.Possible negative effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in pregnancy relate to congenital anomalies, negative perinatal events and neurodevelopmental outcome. Many studies are confounded by the underlying maternal disease and by pharmacogenetic and pharmacokinetic differences of these drugs. Areas covered: The possible interactions of SSRIs and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors with other drugs and the known effects of SSRIs on congenital anomalies, perinatal and neurodevelopmental outcome. Expert opinion: SSRIs should be given with caution when combined with other drugs that are metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. SSRIs apparently increase the rate of severe cardiac malformations, induce neonatal adaptation problems in up to 30% of the offspring, increase the rate of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn and possibly slightly increase the rate of prematurity and low birth weight. Most neurodevelopmental follow up studies did not find significant cognitive impairments except some transient gross motor delay, slight impairment of language abilities and possibly behavioral changes. The literature on the possible association of SSRIs with autism spectrum disorder is inconsistent; if an association exists, it is apparently throughout pregnancy. The risk associated with treatment discontinuation seems to outweigh the risk of treatment, as severe maternal depression may negatively affect the child's development. If needed, treatment should continue in pregnancy with the minimal effective dose.
Experiences of an internet-based support and coaching model for adolescents and young adults with ADHD and autism spectrum disorder -a qualitative study.There is a great demand for non-medical treatment and support targeting the needs of adolescents and young adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). There is also a lack of qualitative studies providing in-depth insight into these individuals' own experiences within this area. The current study aimed to explore how adolescents and young adults with ADHD, ASD or both experienced taking part in an internet-based support and coaching intervention.
Executive Dysfunction in Autism Spectrum Disorder Is Associated With a Failure to Modulate Frontoparietal-insular Hub Architecture.Comorbid executive dysfunction in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a barrier to adaptive functioning, despite remittance of core social-communication symptoms. Network models of ASD address core symptoms but not comorbid executive dysfunction. Following recent demonstrations in healthy adults that, with increasing executive demands, hubs embedded within frontoparietal-insular control networks interact with a more diverse set of networks, we hypothesized that the capability of hubs to do so is perturbed in ASD and predicts executive behavior.
Using mouse transgenic and human stem cell technologies to model genetic mutations associated with schizophrenia and autism.Solid progress has occurred over the last decade in our understanding of the molecular genetic basis of neurodevelopmental disorders, and of schizophrenia and autism in particular. Although the genetic architecture of both disorders is far more complex than previously imagined, many key loci have at last been identified. This has allowed
[Discussion on the clinical treatment of infantile cerebral palsy with the differentiated intervention of meridian points on the spine and back].In view of the literature study and clinical practice, the rules of the distribution, the general function and the indication of the meridians points on the spine and back were explored. The TCM mechanism on the rehabilitation of infantile cerebral palsy was studied. The rules of acupoint combination on the spine and back were summarized with meridians, main points and supplementary points involved in the TCM rehabilitation of infantile cerebral palsy. In view of the theoretic study, the advantages on the early infantile motor function, such as body turning, sitting, standing and walking, were analyzed with the long-term intervention of meridian points on the spine and back. It is showed in the rehabilitation of infantile cerebral palsy that the intervention of meridian points on the spine and back improves the motor function on the back and relieves the incoordination in the development between each system and enhances the rehabilitation mechanism of the integration of Chinese and western medicine for the functional development of core stability, which provides much more effective and more precise approach to the diagnosis and treatment of infantile cerebral palsy in clinical practice.
Mild prenatal hypoxia-ischemia leads to social deficits and central and peripheral inflammation in exposed offspring.Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) resulting from intrauterine or perinatal hypoxic-ischemia (HI) is a leading cause of long-term neonatal neurodisability. While most studies of long-term outcome have focused on moderate and severe HIE in term infants, recent work has shown that those with mild HIE may have subtle neurological impairments. However, the impact of mild HI on pre-term infants is much less clear given that pre-term birth is itself a risk factor for neurodisability. Here we show that mild HI insult alters behaviour, inflammation and the corticosterone stress response in a rat model of pre-term HIE. Mild HI exposure led to social deficits in exposed offspring at postnatal day 30, without impairments in the novel object recognition test nor in the open field test. This was also accompanied by elevations in circulating adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone indicating an exaggerated stress response. There were also elevations in il-1β and il-6 but not tnf-α mRNA and protein in the brain and blood samples. In summary we find that a mild HI exposure leads to social deficits, central and peripheral inflammation, and an abnormal corticosterone response which are three core features of autism spectrum disorder. This shows that mild HI exposure may be a risk factor for an abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome in pre-term offspring.
Understanding the roles of glutamine synthetase, glutaminase, and glutamate decarboxylase autoantibodies in imbalanced excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmission as etiological mechanisms of autism.Autism is a heterogeneous neurological disorder that is characterized by impairments in communication and social interactions, repetitive behaviors, and sensory abnormalities. The etiology of autism remains unclear. Animal, genetic, and post-mortem studies suggest that an imbalance exists in the neuronal excitation and inhibition system in autism. The aim of this study was to determine whether alterations of the measured parameters in children with autism are significantly associated with the risk of a sensory dysfunction.
Parent and clinician agreement regarding early behavioral signs in 12- and 18-month-old infants at-risk of autism spectrum disorder.Parent and clinician agreement regarding early behavioral signs of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in children from a high-risk cohort (siblings of children diagnosed with ASD, n = 188) was examined. Infants were assessed prospectively at 12 and 18 months of age using the clinician administered Autism Observational Scale for Infants (AOSI) and the Autism Parent Screen for Infants (APSI) and underwent a blind independent diagnostic assessment for ASD at 36 months of age. Direct comparison of parent and clinician ratings showed poor agreement on all early behavioral signs, with parent-reported symptoms being better able to differentiate between children with and without ASD at both 12 and 18 months of age compared to clinician observations during a brief office visit. The results suggest that parents may detect some clinically informative behaviors based on their day-to-day observations more readily than do clinicians during brief clinical assessments, a result that needs to be replicated in a non-sibling cohort.

Normal CA1 Place Fields but Discoordinated Network Discharge in a Fmr1-Null Mouse Model of Fragile X Syndrome.Silence of FMR1 causes loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and dysregulated translation at synapses, resulting in the intellectual disability and autistic symptoms of fragile X syndrome (FXS). Synaptic dysfunction hypotheses for how intellectual disabilities like cognitive inflexibility arise in FXS predict impaired neural coding in the absence of FMRP. We tested the prediction by comparing hippocampus place cells in wild-type and FXS-model mice. Experience-driven CA1 synaptic function and synaptic plasticity changes are excessive in Fmr1-null mice, but CA1 place fields are normal. However, Fmr1-null discharge relationships to local field potential oscillations are abnormally weak, stereotyped, and homogeneous; also, discharge coordination within Fmr1-null place cell networks is weaker and less reliable than wild-type. Rather than disruption of single-cell neural codes, these findings point to invariant tuning of single-cell responses and inadequate discharge coordination within neural ensembles as a pathophysiological basis of cognitive inflexibility in FXS. VIDEO ABSTRACT.
Using activity schedules to promote varied application use in children with autism.We evaluated the effects of an activity schedule embedded within an iPad on varied play across applications. After establishing a pattern of repetitive gameplay, we taught three children with autism to follow the activity schedule using physical guidance. All participants increased their varied play to four applications per session and demonstrated independent and accurate activity schedule usage. The activity schedule was removed, and responding decreased to baseline levels, demonstrating the activity schedule's control over varied responding. The activity schedule was reintroduced and participant responding maintained when engaging with novel applications.
Evaluation of stimulus intensity fading on reduction of rapid eating in a child with autism.This study assessed the effects of a vibrating pager on reduction of rapid eating. The study also evaluated two strategies for fading the pager, by intensity and by frequency. The pager was successful in decreasing the pace of eating to an appropriate level and the pager prompt was successfully faded. Fading by frequency was ineffective in maintaining an appropriate pace of eating while intensity fading was successful.
Protocol for a prospective longitudinal study investigating the participation and educational trajectories of Australian students with autism.Autism is associated with high cost to individuals, families, communities and government. Understanding educational and participation trajectories during the school years, and factors influencing these, is fundamental to reducing financial and personal costs. The primary aim of this study is to document the trajectories of Australian students with autism during their education. The secondary aim is to examine personal (eg, student skills) and environmental (eg, school setting) factors associated with differing trajectories and outcomes.
Serum proteomic profiling for autism using magnetic bead-assisted matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry: a pilot study.The pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorders remains elusive and currently there are no diagnostic or predictive biomarkers in autism available. Proteomic profiling has been used in a wide range of neurodevelopmental disorder studies, which could produce deeper perceptions of the molecular bases behind certain disease and potentially becomes useful in discovering biomarkers in autism spectrum disorders.
Nuclear Excluded Autism-Associated Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog Mutations Dysregulate Neuronal Growth.Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) negatively regulates downstream protein kinase B signaling, resulting in decreased cellular growth and proliferation. PTEN is mutated in a subset of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD); however, the mechanism by which specific point mutations alter PTEN function is largely unknown. Here, we assessed how ASD-associated single-nucleotide variations in PTEN (ASD-PTEN) affect function.
Introduction to the Special Issue: Interventions to Reduce Challenging Behavior Among Individuals With Autism Spectrum Disorder.The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is on the rise. In addition to the social communication skill deficits and restrictive repetitive behaviors and interests, many individuals with ASD engage in challenging behavior. Challenging behavior is associated with a multitude of negative outcomes. Challenging behavior may cause harm to the individual with ASD as well as limit opportunities for educational, vocational, and social participation and development. In addition, caregivers experience high stress and low quality of mental health. As a result, challenging behavior warrants intervention that is specifically tailored to the unique characteristics of individuals with ASD. The purpose of this Special Issue is to showcase recent research in the treatment of challenging behavior for individuals with ASD. This two-part Special Issue contains 12 studies that range from systematic and quality reviews of the intervention literature, to innovative treatment approaches, to studies that develop and evaluate treatments for restrictive and repetitive behaviors and interests.
Developmental social communication deficits in the Shank3 rat model of phelan-mcdermid syndrome and autism spectrum disorder.Mutations in the SHANK3 gene have been discovered in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and the intellectual disability, Phelan-McDermid Syndrome. This study leveraged a new rat model of Shank3 deficiency to assess complex behavioral phenomena, unique to rats, which display a richer social behavior repertoire than mice. Uniquely detectable emissions of ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) in rats serve as situation-dependent affective signals and accomplish important communicative functions. We report, for the first time, a call and response acoustic playback assay of bidirectional social communication in juvenile Shank3 rats. Interestingly, we found that Shank3-deficient null males did not demonstrate the enhanced social approach behavior typically exhibited following playback of pro-social USV. Concomitantly, we discovered that emission of USV in response to playback was not genotype-dependent and emitted response calls were divergent in meaning. This is the first report of these socially relevant responses using a genetic model of ASD. A comprehensive and empirical analysis of vigorous play during juvenile reciprocal social interactions further revealed fewer bouts and reduced durations of time spent playing by multiple key parameters, including reduced anogenital sniffing and allogrooming. We further discovered that male null Shank3-deficient pups emitted fewer isolation-induced USV than Shank3 wildtype controls. Postnatal whole brain anatomical phenotyping was applied to visualize anatomical substrates that underlie developmental phenotypes. The data presented here lend support for the important role of Shank3 in social communication, the core symptom domain of ASD. By increasing the number of in vivo functional outcome measures, we improved the likelihood for identifying and moving forward with medical interventions.

Developmental change in look durations predicts later effortful control in toddlers at familial risk for ASD.Difficulties with executive functioning (EF) are common in individuals with a range of developmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Interventions that target underlying mechanisms of EF early in development could be broadly beneficial, but require infant markers of such mechanisms in order to be feasible. Prospective studies of infants at high familial risk (HR) for ASD have revealed a surprising tendency for HR toddlers to show longer epochs of attention to faces than low-risk (LR) controls. In typical development, decreases in look durations towards the end of the first year of life are driven by the development of executive attention-a foundational component of EF. Here, we test the hypothesis that prolonged attention to visual stimuli (including faces) in HR toddlers reflects early differences in the development of executive attention.
Facilitating Neurofeedback in Children with Autism and Intellectual Impairments Using TAGteach.Individuals with autism and intellectual impairments tend to be excluded from research due to their difficulties with methodological compliance. This study focuses on using Teaching with Acoustic Guidance-TAGteach-to behaviorally prepare children with autism and a IQ ≤ 80 to participate in a study on neurofeedback training (NFT). Seven children (ages 6-8) learned the prerequisite skills identified in a task analysis in an average of 5 h of TAGteach training, indicating that this is a feasible method of preparing intellectually-impaired children with autism to participate in NFT and task-dependent electroencephalography measures. TAGteach may thus have the potential to augment this population's ability to participate in less accessible treatments and behavioral neuroscientific studies.
NREM sleep EEG activity and procedural memory: A comparison between young neurotypical and autistic adults without sleep complaints.Delta EEG activity (0.75-3.75 Hz) during non-Rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep reflects the thalamo-cortical system contribution to memory consolidation. The functional integrity of this system is thought to be compromised in the Autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This lead us to investigate the topography of NREM sleep Delta EEG activity in young adults with ASD and typically-developed individuals (TYP). The relationship between Delta EEG activity and sensory-motor procedural information was also examined using a rotary pursuit task. Two dependent variables were computed: a learning index (performance increase across trials) and a performance index (average performance for all trials). The ASD group showed less Delta EEG activity during NREM sleep over the parieto-occipital recording sites compared to the TYP group. Delta EEG activity dropped more abruptly from frontal to posterior regions in the ASD group. Both groups of participants learned the task at a similar rate but the ASD group performed less well in terms of contact time with the target. Delta EEG activity during NREM sleep, especially during stage 2, correlated positively with the learning index for electrodes located all over the cortex in the TYP group, but only in the frontal region in the ASD group. Delta EEG activity, especially during stage 2, correlated positively with the performance index, but in the ASD group only. These results reveal an atypical thalamo-cortical functioning over the parieto-occipital region in ASD. They also point toward an atypical relationship between the frontal area and the encoding of sensory-motor procedural memory in ASD.

The Use of Complementary Alternative Medicine in Children and Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder.Complementary alternative medicine (CAM) is used to a greater degree in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), when compared to children and adolescents without this diagnosis. There is limited evidence supporting the use of many of these treatments in ASD, despite their popularity. Current FDA approved medications for ASD target associated behavioral symptoms of the diagnosis, not the core symptoms of social communication deficits and restricted/repetitive behaviors. These medications are also associated with concerning adverse effects. Evidence-based therapies for core symptoms, such as applied behavior analysis (ABA), are sometimes difficult for families to access for various reasons. Families are sometimes hesitant to discuss their interest in CAM with physicians. Physicians report knowledge gaps about CAM and their use in ASD and concerns about potential conflict with parents regarding differing beliefs of CAM's role in the management of ASD. It is important for physicians to know the current evidence which examines the use of CAM treatments in children and adolescents with autism so that they may have conversations with families which are informed and evidence-based.
Repint of "Reframing autism as a behavioral syndrome and not a specific mental disorder: Implications of genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity".Clinical and molecular genetics have advanced current knowledge on genetic disorders associated with autism. A review of diverse genetic disorders associated with autism is presented and for the first time discussed extensively with regard to possible common underlying mechanisms leading to a similar cognitive-behavioral phenotype of autism. The possible role of interactions between genetic and environmental factors, including epigenetic mechanisms, is in particular examined. Finally, the pertinence of distinguishing non-syndromic autism (isolated autism) from syndromic autism (autism associated with genetic disorders) will be reconsidered. Given the high genetic and etiological heterogeneity of autism, autism can be viewed as a behavioral syndrome related to known genetic disorders (syndromic autism) or currently unknown disorders (apparent non-syndromic autism), rather than a specific categorical mental disorder. It highlights the need to study autism phenotype and developmental trajectory through a multidimensional, non-categorical approach with multivariate analyses within autism spectrum disorder but also across mental disorders, and to conduct systematically clinical genetic examination searching for genetic disorders in all individuals (children but also adults) with autism.
Use of N-Acetylcysteine in Psychiatric Conditions among Children and Adolescents: A Scoping Review.N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a well-known antidote for acetaminophen toxicity and is easily available over the counter. It has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and an established tolerance and safety profile. Owing to its neuroprotective effects, its clinical use has recently expanded to include the treatment of different psychiatric and non-psychiatric disorders. Although a number of randomized controlled trials have documented the clinical evidence for NAC, there are no reviews that summarize the evidence. The present scoping review summarizes the study designs, the patient characteristics, the evidence and the limitations in randomized controlled trials designed to explore the efficacy of NAC for psychiatric conditions in the pediatric population.
Folate receptor autoantibodies are prevalent in children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, their normal siblings and parents.Folate deficiency can affect fetal and neonatal brain development Considering the reported association of Folate receptor alpha (FRα) autoantibodies (Abs) with autism and developmental disorders, we sought to confirm this in families of 82 children with ASD, 53 unaffected siblings, 65 fathers, and 70 mothers, along with 52 unrelated normal controls. Overall, 76% of the affected children, 75% of the unaffected siblings, 69% of fathers and 59% of mothers were positive for either blocking or binding Ab, whereas the prevalence of this Ab in the normal controls was 29%. The Ab was highly prevalent in affected families including unaffected siblings. The appearance of these antibodies may have a familial origin but the risk of developing ASD is likely influenced by other mitigating factors since some siblings who had the antibodies were not affected. The antibody response appears heritable with the blocking autoantibody in the parents and affected child increasing the risk of ASD.

Relationship between absolute and relative ratios of glutamate, glutamine and GABA and severity of autism spectrum disorder.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental pathology characterized by an impairment in social interaction, communication difficulties, and repetitive behaviors. Glutamate signaling abnormalities are thought to be considered as major etiological mechanisms leading to ASD. The search for amino-acidic catabolytes related to glutamate in patients with different levels of ASD might help current research to clarify the mechanisms underlying glutamate signaling and its disorders, particularly in relation to ASD. In the present study, plasma levels of the amino acids and their derivatives glutamate, glutamine, and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), associated with their relative ratios, were evaluated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique in 40 male children with ASD and in 38 age- and gender-matched neurotypical health controls. The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) was used to evaluate social cognition, and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) was used to assess subjects' behaviors. Children with ASD exhibited a significant elevation of plasma GABA and glutamate/glutamine ratio, as well as significantly lower levels of plasma glutamine and glutamate/GABA ratios compared to controls. No significant correlation was found between glutamate levels and the severity of autism, measured by CARS and SRS. In receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, the area under the curve for GABA compared to other parameters was close to one, indicating its potential use as a biomarker. Glutamine appeared as the best predictive prognostic markers in the present study. The results of the present study indicate a disturbed balance between GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission in ASD. The study also indicates that an increased plasma level of GABA can be potentially used as an early diagnostic biomarker for ASD.
New perspectives in autism spectrum disorders.Autism spectrum disorder, a complex developmental disorder, has been found to be one of the most heritable neuropsychiatric disorders. The next step will be to translate these findings into successful treatments for this disorder.
Brain and behavior development in autism from birth through infancy.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous condition that affects 1 in 68 children. Diagnosis is based on the presence of characteristic behavioral impairments that emerge in the second year of life and thus is not typically made until 3 to 4 years of age. Recent studies of early brain and behavior development have provided important new insights into the nature of this condition. Autism-specific brain imaging features have been identified as early as 6 months of age, and age-specific brain and behavior changes have been demonstrated across the first 2 years of life, highlighting the developmental nature of ASD. New findings demonstrate that early brain imaging in the first year of life holds great promise for presymptomatic prediction of ASD. There is a general understanding in medicine that earlier treatment has better outcomes than later treatment, and in autism, there is an emerging consensus that earlier intervention results in more successful outcomes for the child. Examining early brain and behavior trajectories also has the potential to parse the etiologic heterogeneity in ASD, a well-recognized impediment to developing targeted, mechanistic treatments. This review highlights the current state of the science in the pursuit of early brain and behavioral markers of autism during infancy and examines the potential implications of these findings for treatment of this condition.
Autism and talent: the cognitive and neural basis of systemizing.In 2003, we proposed the hypersystemizing theory of autism. The theory proposes that the human mind possesses a systemizing mechanism (SM) that helps identify lawful regularities (often causal) that govern the input-operation-output workings of a system. The SM can be tuned to different levels, from low to high, with a normal distribution of individual differences in how strongly people search for such input-operation-out-put regularities in any data that is systemizable. Evidence suggests that people with autism are on average hypersystemizers, scoring higher than average on the systemizing quotient and on performance tests of systemizing. In this article, we consider the neural basis behind the SM, since there has been little consideration of the brain basis of systemizing. Finally, we discuss directions for future work in this field.
Sexuality in autism: hypersexual and paraphilic behavior in women and men with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder.Like nonaffected adults, individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) show the entire range of sexual behaviors. However, due to the core symptoms of the disorder spectrum, including deficits in social skills, sensory hypo- and hypersensitivities, and repetitive behaviors, some ASD individuals might develop quantitatively above-average or nonnormative sexual behaviors and interests. After reviewing the relevant literature on sexuality in high-functioning ASD individuals, we present novel findings on the frequency of normal sexual behaviors and those about the assessment of hypersexual and paraphilic fantasies and behaviors in ASD individuals from our own study. Individuals with ASD seem to have more hypersexual and paraphilic fantasies and behaviors than general-population studies suggest. However, this inconsistency is mainly driven by the observations for male participants with ASD. This could be due to the fact that women with ASD are usually more socially adapted and show less ASD symptomatology. The peculiarities in sexual behaviors in ASD patients should be considered both for sexual education and in therapeutic approaches.
Vaccination as a cause of autism-myths and controversies.Despite significant progress in the study of the epidemiology and genetics of autism, the etiology and patho-physiology of this condition is far from being elucidated and no curative treatment currently exists. Although solid scientific research continues, in an attempt to find explanations and solutions, a number of nonscientific and pure myths about autism have emerged. Myths that vaccines or mercury are associated with autism have been amplified by misguided scientists; frustrated, but effective parent groups; and politicians. Preventing the protection provided by vaccination or administration of mercury-chelating agents may cause real damage to autistic individuals and to innocent bystanders who as a result may be exposed to resurgent diseases that had already been "extinguished. " That such myths flourish is a consequence of the authority of scientific evidence obtained by scientific methodology losing ground to alternative truths and alternative science. This article presents a narrative of the origin of the myths around autism.
Pharmacotherapy of emotional and behavioral symptoms associated with autism spectrum disorder in children and adolescents.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by impairment in social communication and restricted patterns of behavior. Although there is no pharmacological treatment approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the core symptoms of ASD, there is mounting support in the literature for the management of behavioral symptoms associated with this developmental disorder, in particular, irritability and hyperactivity. Aripiprazole and risperidone are currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of irritability in youth with ASD. Though not FDA-approved, methylphenidate and guanfacine are effective for the management of hyperactivity in children with ASD. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are often used in clinical practice to target anxiety and compulsions; however, there is little evidence to support its use in this population. There is a great need for further research on the safety and efficacy of existing psychotropic medications in youth with ASD, as well as the development of new treatment modalities for the core and associated behavioral symptoms.
Impacts of stress on reproductive and social behaviors.Impacts of steroid stress hormones on the brain have provided multiple opportunities for linking specific molecular phenomena to behavioral state. The negative impacts of stress on female reproductive biological processes have been documented thoroughly at the endocrine and behavioral levels. More recently, a '3-hit' theory of autism has identified early stress as one of the hits. The multiple biochemical effects of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) indicated that it would serve as a powerful maternal immune activator. The prenatal exposure to LPS coupled with the other two 'hits'- an autism-related mutation and the Y chromosome - - heightened certain autism-like signs in mouse behavior.
Formulation, stability testing, and analytical characterization of melatonin-based preparation for clinical trial.A new institutional clinical trial assessed the improvement of sleep disorders in 40 children with autism treated by immediate-release melatonin formulation in different regimens (0.5 mg, 2 mg, and 6 mg daily) for one month. The objectives of present study were to (i) prepare low-dose melatonin hard capsules for pediatric use controlled by two complementary methods and (ii) carry out a stability study in order to determine a use-by-date. Validation of preparation process was claimed as ascertained by mass uniformity of hard capsules. Multicomponent analysis by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transformed infrared (ATR-FTIR) of melatonin/microcrystalline cellulose mixture allowed to identify and quantify relative content of active pharmaceutical ingredients and excipients. Absolute melatonin content analysis by high performance liquid chromatography in 0.5 mg and 6 mg melatonin capsules was 93.6%±4.1% and 98.7%±6.9% of theoretical value, respectively. Forced degradation study showed a good separation of melatonin and its degradation products. The capability of the method was 15, confirming a risk of false negative <0.01%. Stability test and dissolution test were compliant over 18 months of storage with European Pharmacopoeia. Preparation of melatonin hard capsules was completed manually and melatonin in hard capsules was stable for 18 months, in spite of low doses of active ingredient. ATR-FTIR offers a real alternative to HPLC for quality control of high-dose melatonin hard capsules before the release of clinical batches.
Safety and Observations from a Placebo-Controlled, Crossover Study to Assess Use of Autologous Umbilical Cord Blood Stem Cells to Improve Symptoms in Children with Autism.The aim of this exploratory study was to assess the safety and clinical effects of autologous umbilical cord blood (AUCB) infusion in children with idiopathic autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Twenty-nine children 2 to 6 years of age with a confirmed diagnosis of ASD participated in this randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Participants were randomized to receive AUCB or placebo, evaluated at baseline, 12, and 24 weeks, received the opposite infusion, then re-evaluated at the same time points. Evaluations included assessments of safety, Expressive One Word Picture Vocabulary Test, 4th edition, Receptive One Word Picture Vocabulary Test, 4th edition, Clinical Global Impression, Stanford-Binet Fluid Reasoning and Knowledge, and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior and Socialization Subscales. Generalized linear models were used to assess the effects of the response variables at the 12- and 24-week time periods under each condition (AUCB, placebo). There were no serious adverse events. There were trends toward improvement, particularly in socialization, but there were no statistically significant differences for any endpoints. The results of this study suggest that autologous umbilical cord infusions are safe for children with ASD. Tightly controlled trials are necessary to further progress the study of AUCB for autism.

Spatial navigation from same and different directions: The role of executive functions, memory and attention in adults with autism spectrum disorder.To resolve some of the inconsistencies in existing research into spatial navigation in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), we tested two large age- and ability-matched groups of ASD and typically developing (TD) participants for their spatial navigation abilities in a route learning task, which has been shown to shed light on the strategies participants employ when navigating complex environments. Participants studied a route through a virtual maze by watching a short video of a first-person perspective navigating a maze. The maze included four four-way intersections that were each marked with two unique landmarks in two corners of the intersection. At test, static images of the intersections, either as seen during the video or as approached from a different direction, were presented and participants had to indicate in which direction they would need to travel (straight, left, or right) in order to follow the originally studied route. On both types of test trials, the ASD group performed worse and their difficulties were related to reduced cognitive flexibility. Eye-movement data and follow-up item-memory tests suggested that navigation difficulties may have been related to differences in attention during encoding and less spontaneous use of landmarks as cues for navigation. Spatial navigation performance was best predicted by memory for landmarks as well as by executive functions. The results are discussed in relation to theories of underlying navigation-related brain regions. More research is needed to disentangle the influence of executive functions, memory and attention on spatial navigation.

Sensory and motor differences in Autism Spectrum Conditions and developmental coordination disorder in children: A cross-syndrome study.Recent research has shown that Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) can present with some similar symptomology as Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC). This paper therefore explored the similarities and differences in coordination and sensory responsivity between DCD and ASC. 77 children took part: 42 (35 male, 7 female) with ASC (ages 7-21: mean age 12.23 years), 26 (19 male, 7 female) with DCD (ages 7-21; mean age 11.07 years) and 9 (2 male, 7 female) with ASC and DCD (ages 8-15; mean age 12.27). All groups completed a battery of validated parent report measures online that included motor coordination (DCDQ), sensory responsivity (SPC-R) and social communication measures (AQ). Results showed no significant differences in coordination, and some significant differences in sensory responsivity between ASC and DCD (increased visual and auditory responsivity and decreased proprioception). Exploratory analysis showed that these differences showed good validity in identifying the diagnosis of ASC and DCD. These results elucidate the underlying causes of motor coordination difficulties in both conditions. Specifically, ASC coordination difficulties appear linked to visual processing impairments, whilst DCD coordination difficulties appear to be linked to spatial processing. This may aid better diagnosis and intervention for these conditions.
Meta-analysis and systematic review of the literature characterizing auditory mismatch negativity in individuals with autism.A number of past studies have used mismatch negativity (MMN) to identify auditory processing deficits in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Our meta-analysis compared MMN responses for individuals with ASD and typically developing controls (TD). We analyzed 67 experiments across 22 publications that employed passive, auditory-based MMN paradigms with ASD and TD participants. Most studies lacked design characteristics that would lead to an accurate description of the MMN. Variability between experiments measuring MMN amplitude was smaller when limited to studies that counterbalanced stimuli. Reduced MMN amplitude was found among young children with ASD compared to controls and in experiments that used nonspeech sounds. Still, few studies included adolescents or those with below-average verbal IQ. Most studies suffered from small sample sizes, and aggregating these data did not reveal significant group differences. This analysis points to a need for research focused specifically on understudied ASD samples using carefully designed MMN experiments. Study of individual differences in MMN may provide further insights into distinct subgroups within the heterogeneous ASD population.
The placental immune response is dysregulated developmentally vitamin D deficient rats: Relevance to autism.Emerging evidence suggests that maternal or developmental vitamin D (DVD) deficiency is a risk factor for Autism Spectrum Disorders. A well-established association has also been found between gestational infection and increased incidence of autism. Placenta mediates the maternal immune response in respect to the foetus. The placenta is also a major source of vitamin D and locally produced vitamin D is an essential regulator of immune function during pregnancy. Here we investigate the effects of DVD-deficiency on baseline placental immune status and in response to the well-known viral and bacterial immune activating agents polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (poly(I:C) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We show DVD-deficiency does not affect baseline inflammatory cytokines in placenta. However, when challenged with poly(I:C) but not LPS, DVD-deficient placentas from male foetuses had higher production of IL-6 and 1L-1β compared to control placentas. This suggests the developing DVD-deficient male foetus may be particularly vulnerable to maternal viral exposures. This in turn may have adverse implications for the developing male brain. In conclusion, a dysregulated placental immune response may provide a plausible mechanism for both the epidemiological links between DVD-deficiency and increased male incidence of developmental conditions such as autism.
Local and Global Visual Processing in 3-Year-Olds With and Without Autism.Research on visual local and global perception in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is incomplete in young children. We investigated 35 three-year-old siblings of children with ASD, either diagnosed (n = 12) or not diagnosed (n = 23) with ASD as well as 14 controls with typical development and with no family history of ASD. Data from the local tasks Children's Embedded Figures Test, Hidden Pictures, Figure-Ground and the global tasks Closure and Fragmented Picture Test were collected. Enhanced performance on the local task Hidden Pictures differentiated children with ASD from the other groups. Implications of these results are discussed.
A Review of Childhood Behavioral Problems and Disorders in the Development of Obesity: Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and Beyond.Given the high rates of pediatric and adult obesity, it is imperative to identify early risk factors that might contribute to excess weight gain. This review aims to investigate the relationship between childhood behavioral problems with the development and persistence of obesity. Specifically, this review highlights the association of obesity with (1) neurocognitive constructs, such as executive functioning and inhibition/impulsivity, and (2) disorders commonly diagnosed in childhood, including attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
Examining the Association Between Autistic Traits and Atypical Sensory Reactivity: A Twin Study.Atypical responses to sensory stimuli are common features of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Consequently, atypical sensory reactivity (SR) is now a diagnostic feature of ASD. Quantitative genetic research on ASD has overlooked these symptoms, however. We therefore investigated the association between autistic traits and SR using twin methods.
'Something needs to change': Mental health experiences of young autistic adults in England.There is a high incidence and prevalence of mental health problems among young people, with several barriers to help-seeking noted in this group. High rates of mental health problems have also been reported in children and adults on the autism spectrum. Taken together, young autistic people may be a particularly vulnerable group when it comes to mental health. Yet, there has been remarkably little work on the mental health needs and experiences of young autistic adults (16-25 years). Adopting a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach - in which academic researchers and young autistic adults collaborated in an equitable research partnership - we explored young autistic people's experiences of mental health problems and their perspectives on the support they sought, if any, for these problems. A total of 130 young autistic adults took part in the research: 109 completed an online survey and 21 took part in detailed interviews. The results highlight how young autistic people find it difficult to evaluate their mental health, experience high levels of stigma and often face severe obstacles when trying to access mental health support. The findings also demonstrate how listening to - and learning from - young autistic people is crucial in ensuring that their mental health needs are met.
Association between hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and risk of autism in offspring: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common severe pervasive neurodevelopmental disorder of undetermined etiology. Environmental exposures, especially pregnancy complications, have been increasingly recognized as a potential risk factor for ASD. Our aim was to (1) systematically evaluate the association between hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) and the risk of ASD in offspring, (2) specifically draw a subgroup analysis of disease severity in patients with HDP to achieve more sufficient evidence on this issue.
Paraprofessional-Delivered Video Prompting to Teach Academics to Students with Severe Disabilities in Inclusive Settings.Video prompting is effective for teaching a variety of skills (e.g., daily living, communication) to students with autism and intellectual disability; yet, little research exists on the efficacy of these strategies on academic skills, in inclusive settings, and with typical intervention agents. Authors collaborated with paraprofessionals to select socially important academic skills (i.e., literacy, social studies, science, and math) aligned with students' IEPs and content taught in their inclusive classes. Results from the multiple probe across participants and skills design indicated a functional relation between the paraprofessional-delivered video prompting and correct responding to academic tasks for all three elementary students with autism and intellectual disability. Implications for practitioners, study limitations, and recommendations for future research are discussed.
[Genetic and neuroendocrine aspects in autism spectrum disorder].The autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was described in 1943 and is defined as a developmental disorder that affects social interaction and communication. It is usually identified in early stages of development from 18 months of age. Currently, autism is considered a neurological disorder with a spectrum covering cases of different degrees, which is associated with genetic factors, not genetic and environmental. Among the genetic factors, various syndromes have been described that are associated with this disorder. Also, the neurobiology of autism has been studied at the genetic, neurophysiological, neurochemical and neuropathological levels. Neuroimaging techniques have shown multiple structural abnormalities in these patients. There have also been changes in the serotonergic, GABAergic, catecholaminergic and cholinergic systems related to this disorder. This paper presents an update of the information presented in the genetic and neuroendocrine aspects of autism spectrum disorder.
Representing autism: Challenges of collective representation in German and Israeli associations for and of autistic people.The important work done by various associations of and for people with disabilities is legitimated by their claim for collective representation. However, there is little empirical research that examines the organizational basis for such claims. We focus on patient/disability advocacy associations that illustrate a split of representation between organizations of and for autism. Drawing on documentary analysis and semi-structured interviews conducted in 2015-2017 with members and office-holders of autism associations in Germany and Israel, we highlight several common gaps and their relations to the organizational characteristics of the associations: Representing only part of the autism spectrum, and lack of efficient procedures for including the variety of members. We conclude by discussing the language and epistemology of "high-functioning"/"Aspies" vs. "low-functioning"/"Kanners" as politically and culturally embedded, highlighting the significance and difficulties of dialogue amidst autism-related epistemic communities.
Significant transcriptional changes in 15q duplication but not Angelman syndrome deletion stem cell-derived neurons.The inability to analyze gene expression in living neurons from Angelman (AS) and Duplication 15q (Dup15q) syndrome subjects has limited our understanding of these disorders at the molecular level.
The bidirectional association between sleep problems and autism spectrum disorder: a population-based cohort study.Sleep difficulties are prevalent in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The temporal nature of the association between sleep problems and ASD is unclear because longitudinal studies are lacking. Our aim is to clarify whether sleep problems precede and worsen autistic traits and ASD or occur as a consequence of the disorder.
Identification of Symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorders in the Second Year of Life at Day-Care Centres by Day-Care Staff: Step One in the Development of a Short Observation List.Early symptoms of ASD develop through the second year of life, making a stable ASD diagnosis possible at 24 months of age. However, in general, children with ASD have their diagnosis at an older age. This retrospective study, including 30 children with ASD and 30 control children aged 3-6 years, explored the possibility of developing a short observation list to be used in day care settings for children 12-24 months of age. From 73 symptoms selected from published screeners and observation tools, we were able to construct a list of six symptoms that retrospectively differentiated children with ASD from typically developing children at 12-24 months of age when recalled by day-care personnel.
Network Analysis of UBE3A/E6AP-Associated Proteins Provides Connections to Several Distinct Cellular Processes.Perturbations in activity and dosage of the UBE3A ubiquitin-ligase have been linked to Angelman syndrome and autism spectrum disorders. UBE3A was initially identified as the cellular protein hijacked by the human papillomavirus E6 protein to mediate the ubiquitylation of p53, a function critical to the oncogenic potential of these viruses. Although a number of substrates have been identified, the normal cellular functions and pathways affected by UBE3A are largely unknown. Previously, we showed that UBE3A associates with HERC2, NEURL4, and MAPK6/ERK3 in a high-molecular-weight complex of unknown function that we refer to as the HUN complex (HERC2, UBE3A, and NEURL4). In this study, the combination of two complementary proteomic approaches with a rigorous network analysis revealed cellular functions and pathways in which UBE3A and the HUN complex are involved. In addition to finding new UBE3A-associated proteins, such as MCM6, SUGT1, EIF3C, and ASPP2, network analysis revealed that UBE3A-associated proteins are connected to several fundamental cellular processes including translation, DNA replication, intracellular trafficking, and centrosome regulation. Our analysis suggests that UBE3A could be involved in the control and/or integration of these cellular processes, in some cases as a component of the HUN complex, and also provides evidence for crosstalk between the HUN complex and CAMKII interaction networks. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the cellular functions of UBE3A and its potential role in pathways that may be affected in Angelman syndrome, UBE3A-associated autism spectrum disorders, and human papillomavirus-associated cancers.
Associations Between Emotion Regulation and Social Impairment in Children and Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder.In typically-developing (TD) individuals, effective emotion regulation strategies have been associated with positive outcomes in various areas, including social functioning. Although impaired social functioning is a core criterion of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), the role of emotion regulation ability in ASD has been largely ignored. This study investigated the association between emotion regulation and ASD symptomatology, with a specific emphasis on social impairment. We used parent-report questionnaires to assess the regulatory strategies and symptom severity of 145 youth with ASD. Results showed that: (1) more effective emotion regulation, defined by greater use of reappraisal, predicted less severe ASD symptomatology, and (2) greater use of reappraisal predicted less severe social impairment. Suppression was not predictive of general symptomatology or social functioning.
The impact on the family of the co-existing conditions of children with autism spectrum disorder.We aimed to investigate whether the impact on families of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is associated with the number and/or type of emotional and behavioral co-existing conditions that parents/carers of children with ASD reported as occurring frequently. In addition, we examined whether there was a greater impact on families if their child was male, had lower levels of language, had more severe autism symptomatology, and whether impact was associated with the number and/or type of co-existing conditions. Families were recruited from large UK research databases. 420 parents/carers of children aged 3 years 2 months to 18 years 8 months completed the revised Impact on Family (IoF) Scale and reported on the frequency/rate of their child's co-existing conditions. Parents/carers reported higher mean IoF scores if their child: had a greater number of frequent co-existing conditions; had sleep problems; was only able to communicate physically; and had more severe autism symptomatology. The development and implementation of targeted treatment and management approaches are needed to reduce the impact of co-existing conditions on family life.

Transcriptional and splicing dysregulation in the prefrontal cortex in valproic acid rat model of autism.Gene-environmental interaction could be the major cause of autism. The aim of the current study is to detect the effects of valproic acid on gene expression profiles and alternatively spliced genes in the prefrontal cortex in rat models of autism. Female rats received a single intraperitoneal injection of 600 mg/kg valproic acid at day 12.5 post-conception, and controls were injected with saline. Only male offspring were employed in the current study. RNA sequencing was used to investigate transcriptome in the prefrontal cortex of VPA-exposed rats. There were 3228 differently expressed genes and 637 alternative spliced genes, in VPA rats compared to controls. Pathways enrichment among the differently expressed genes and alternatively spliced genes were associated with neurological diseases and neural system development. The results implied VPA affected transcriptional and splicing events genome-wide and the transcriptional and splicing events may be associated with the autistic behaviors of VPA rats.
From Using Tools to Using Language in Infant Siblings of Children with Autism.Forty-one high-risk infants (HR) with an older sibling with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) were observed longitudinally at 10, 12, 18 and 24 months of age during a tool use task in a play-like scenario. Changes in grasp types and functional actions produced with a spoon were assessed during elicited tool use. Outcome and vocabulary measures were available at 36 months, distinguishing: 11 HR-ASD, 15 HR-language delay and 15 HR-no delay. Fewer HR-ASD infants produced grasp types facilitating spoon use at 24 months and functional actions at 10 months than HR-no delay. Production of functional actions in HR infants at 10 months predicted word comprehension at 12 months and word production at 24 and 36 months.
Brief Report: Self-Injurious Behaviors in Preschool Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder Compared to Other Developmental Delays and Disorders.We compared the prevalence of self-injurious behaviors (SIB) in preschoolers aged 30-68 months with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (n = 691) versus other developmental delays and disorders (DD) (n = 977) accounting for sociodemographic, cognitive, and medical factors. SIB prevalence was higher in ASD versus all DD [adjusted odds-ratio (aOR) 2.13 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.53, 2.97)]. In subgroup analyses, SIB prevalence was higher in ASD versus DD without ASD symptoms [aOR 4.42 (95% CI 2.66, 7.33)], but was similar between ASD and DD with ASD symptoms [aOR 1.09 (95% CI 0.68, 1.77)]. We confirmed higher prevalence of SIB in ASD versus DD, independent of confounders. In children with DD, SIB prevalence increased with more ASD symptoms. These findings are informative to clinicians, researchers, and policymakers.
Listening to Bedouin Mothers of Children with Autism.This article examines how Bedouin mothers in Israel describe, perceive, and interpret their experiences raising a child with autism. Data were collected using semi-structured ethnographic interviews with 18 Bedouin mothers of children with autism, aged 6-16, living in recognized and unrecognized settlements in the Negev. Analysis of the study findings shows how the subaltern status of Bedouin women, which includes their husbands' constant threats of divorce or taking a second wife, makes it difficult for them to be mobile and interact in the public sphere without the presence of a man and creates an experience unique to these mothers, which we call "Exclusion within Exclusion". The Bedouin mothers report not only stigmatization, a lack of social support and loneliness but also structural-cultural characteristics that prevent them from obtaining information and participating in decision-making about the child with autism and that restrict their agency in dealing with and coping with their child's autism. In light of this situation, the discussion highlights the unique connection between local cultural scripts and the phenomenology of autism.
Immune or Genetic-Mediated Disruption of CASPR2 Causes Pain Hypersensitivity Due to Enhanced Primary Afferent Excitability.Human autoantibodies to contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2) are often associated with neuropathic pain, and CASPR2 mutations have been linked to autism spectrum disorders, in which sensory dysfunction is increasingly recognized. Human CASPR2 autoantibodies, when injected into mice, were peripherally restricted and resulted in mechanical pain-related hypersensitivity in the absence of neural injury. We therefore investigated the mechanism by which CASPR2 modulates nociceptive function. Mice lacking CASPR2 (Cntnap2
Social partner gaze direction and conversational phase; factors affecting social attention during face-to-face conversations in autistic adults?Social attention is atypical in autism. However, the majority of evidence for this claim comes from studies where the social partner is not physically present and the participants are children. Consequently, to ensure acquisition of a comprehensive overview of social attention in autism, systematic analysis of factors known to influence face-to-face social attention in neurotypicals is necessary and evidence from adulthood is required. This study assessed the influence of experimenter gaze direction (direct or averted) and conversational phase (speaking or listening) on social attention during a face-to-face conversation. Eye-tracking analyses indicated that when the experimenter looked directly at the participant, autistic adults looked at the experimenter's face less than did neurotypical adults. However, this between-group difference was significantly reduced when the experimenter's gaze was averted. Therefore, opportunities for reciprocal social gaze are missed by autistic adults when the social partner makes direct eye contact. A greater proportion of time was spent fixating the experimenter's eye region when participants were speaking compared to listening in both neurotypical and autistic adults. Overall, this study provides a rich picture of the nature of social attention in face-to-face conversations adopted by autistic adults and demonstrates individual variation in social attention styles.
Damaging de novo mutations diminish motor skills in children on the autism spectrum.In individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), de novo mutations have previously been shown to be significantly correlated with lower IQ but not with the core characteristics of ASD: deficits in social communication and interaction and restricted interests and repetitive patterns of behavior. We extend these findings by demonstrating in the Simons Simplex Collection that damaging de novo mutations in ASD individuals are also significantly and convincingly correlated with measures of impaired motor skills. This correlation is not explained by a correlation between IQ and motor skills. We find that IQ and motor skills are distinctly associated with damaging mutations and, in particular, that motor skills are a more sensitive indicator of mutational severity than is IQ, as judged by mutational type and target gene. We use this finding to propose a combined classification of phenotypic severity: mild (little impairment of either), moderate (impairment mainly to motor skills), and severe (impairment of both IQ and motor skills).
Proneness to guilt, shame, and pride in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders and neurotypical children.Self-conscious emotions (e.g., guilt, shame, and pride) are complex emotions that require self-reflection and self-evaluation, and are thought to facilitate the maintenance of societal norms and personal standards. Despite the importance of self-conscious emotions, most research has focused on basic emotion processing in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Therefore, in the present study, we used the Test of Self-Conscious Affect for Children (TOSCA-C) to assess proneness to, or propensity to experience, the self-conscious emotions guilt, shame, and pride in children with ASD and neurotypical children. The TOSCA-C is designed to capture a child's natural tendency to experience a given emotion across a range of everyday situations [Tangney, Stuewig, & Mashek, 2007]. We also assessed how individual characteristics contribute to the development of proneness to self-conscious emotions, including theory of mind (ToM) and ASD symptomatology. In comparison to neurotypical children, children with ASD showed less proneness to guilt, although all children showed relatively high levels of proneness to guilt. Greater ToM ability was related to more proneness to guilt and authentic pride in children with ASD. Additionally, we found that children with ASD with more severe symptomatology were more prone to hubristic pride. Our results provide evidence of differences in proneness to self-conscious emotions in children with ASD, as well as highlight important mechanisms contributing to how children with ASD may experience self-conscious emotions.

Outpatient Procedural Sedation of Patients With Autism Spectrum Disorders for Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain Using Propofol.To quantify the number of personnel, time to induce and complete sedation using propofol for outpatient magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, and the frequency of serious adverse events (SAEs) in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared with children without ASD.
Heart rate-defined sustained attention in infants at risk for autism.Although aberrant visual attention has been identified in infants at high familial risk for autism, the developmental emergence of atypical attention remains unclear. Integrating biological measures of attention into prospective high-risk infant studies may inform more nuanced developmental trajectories, clarifying the onset and course of atypical attention and potentially advancing early screening or treatment protocols. Heart rate-defined sustained attention (HRDSA) is a well-validated biological measure of attentional engagement that, in non-clinical infant populations, provides incremental information about attentional engagement beyond looking behaviors alone. The present study aimed to examine the characteristics and clinical correlates of HRDSA in high-risk infants, informing whether HRDSA may operate as a promising biological measure of attention and clinical symptoms in this population.
A New Patient with Potocki-Lupski Syndrome: A Literature Review.Speech delay, intellectual disability, and behavioral disturbances are the main clinical manifestations of Potocki-Lupski syndrome. Other features include infantile hypotonia, the absence of major dysmorphism, sleep disorders, and congenital anomalies, particularly of the cardiovascular system. A male patient with Potocki-Lupski syndrome is reported herein. He showed speech and borderline cognitive delay, behavioral troubles with no signs suggestive of autism, in the absence of major dysmorphism. A de novo 17p12-p11.2 duplication spanning 3.6 Mb was detected, with boundaries from 15,284,052 to 18,647,233 (hg19 assembly). At the age of 5 years, the child showed a noticeable improvement of speech skills and a moderate scholastic performance was reached. Upon analysis of the clinical manifestations of the present patient and those reported in existing literature, we found that the syndrome may present in various degrees of clinical expressivity. Affected patients may manifest symptoms ranging from mild behavioral disturbances to severe degrees of autism.
Differential vocational rehabilitation service patterns and outcomes for transition-age youth with autism.It is important to investigate receipt of vocational rehabilitation (VR) services, service patterns and outcomes for youth with autism, so that limited public resources can be used more efficiently.
Mental Health Interventions for Parent Carers of Children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder: Practice Guidelines from a Critical Interpretive Synthesis (CIS) Systematic Review.Parent carers of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often report increased levels of stress, depression, and anxiety. Unmet parent carer mental health needs pose a significant risk to the psychological, physical, and social well-being of the parents of the child affected by ASD and jeopardize the adaptive functioning of the family as well as the potential of the child affected by ASD. This systematic review identifies key qualities of interventions supporting the mental health of parent carers and proposes practitioner-parent carer support guidelines. A search of four databases (Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Social Science Data) was conducted to identify studies that met the following criteria: (1) an intervention was delivered to parent carers of a child with ASD under the age of 18 years; (2) the research design allowed for a comparison on outcomes across groups; and (3) outcome measures of the parent carers' mental health were used. A total of 23 studies met the inclusion criteria. A critical interpretive synthesis approach was used to produce an integrated conceptualization of the evidence. Findings suggest practitioner guidelines to support the mental health and wellbeing of parent carers should include addressing the parent's self-perspective taking and skill for real time problem-solving.
An interview-informed synthesized contingency analysis to inform the treatment of challenging behavior in a young child with autism.Experimental Functional analysis (EFA) is considered the "gold standard" of behavioural assessment and its use is predictive of treatment success. However, EFA has a number of limitations including its lengthy nature, the high level of expertise required, and the reinforcement of challenging behaviour. This study aimed to further validate a novel interview-informed synthesised contingency analysis (IISCA).
Autism spectrum disorder traits in typically developing emerging adults and associated parenting: A person-centered approach.Research on parenting children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) indicates these children receive parenting tailored to their condition. However, little is known about ASD in adulthood, especially in emerging adults at college, and how they are parented. The current study examined how emerging adults in a non-clinical typically-developing sample differed in their current perceptions of parenting as a function of ASD traits. Participants completed questionnaires about their current perceptions of parenting and self-reported ASD traits. Parenting characteristics assessed included parenting style, discipline, parent-child relationship quality, and parental distress. Results indicated that higher levels of self-reported ASD traits were associated with increasingly ineffective parenting characteristics including lower authoritative style, harsher discipline, poorer parent-child relationship quality (e.g., lower involvement), and higher parental distress. Researchers are encouraged to extend ASD research into adulthood by validating diagnostic methods with adults and investigating processes in adulthood that have been well-established in the childhood ASD literature.
Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 tracer [Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is first manifested during early childhood. Postmortem experiments have identified significantly elevated expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) in cerebellar vermis and prefrontal cortex of individuals with autism.
Characterizing Health Disparities in the Age of Autism Diagnosis in a Study of 8-Year-Old Children.The diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is often delayed from the time of noted concerns to the actual diagnosis. The current study used child- and family-level factors to identify homogeneous classes in a surveillance-based sample (n = 2303) of 8-year-old children with ASD. Using latent class analysis, a 5-class model emerged and the class memberships were examined in relation to the child's median age at ASD diagnosis. Class 3, with known language delays and a high advantage socioeconomically had the lowest age of ASD diagnosis (46.74 months) in comparison to Classes 1 (64.99 months), 4 (58.14 months), and 5 (69.78 months) in this sample. Findings demonstrate sociodemographic and developmental disparities related to the age at ASD diagnosis.
Family Experiences with the Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder: System Barriers and Facilitators of Efficient Diagnosis.This paper examines family experiences with the efficiency of ASD diagnosis. Children were age 8 or younger with ASD (n = 450). Outcomes were delay from first parent concern to diagnosis, shifting diagnoses, and being told child did not have ASD. Predictors were screening, travel distance, and problems finding providers. Logit models were used to examine associations. Screening was associated with reduced delay in diagnosis; problems finding providers were associated with greater delay. Screening, travel distance, and delay in diagnosis were associated with shifting diagnoses and being told child did not have ASD. Physician and parent training in communication and addressing mental health professional shortages and maldistribution may improve the diagnosis experiences of families of children with ASD.
Prediction of Autism at 3 Years from Behavioural and Developmental Measures in High-Risk Infants: A Longitudinal Cross-Domain Classifier Analysis.We integrated multiple behavioural and developmental measures from multiple time-points using machine learning to improve early prediction of individual Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) outcome. We examined Mullen Scales of Early Learning, Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, and early ASD symptoms between 8 and 36 months in high-risk siblings (HR; n = 161) and low-risk controls (LR; n = 71). Longitudinally, LR and HR-Typical showed higher developmental level and functioning, and fewer ASD symptoms than HR-Atypical and HR-ASD. At 8 months, machine learning classified HR-ASD at chance level, and broader atypical development with 69.2% Area Under the Curve (AUC). At 14 months, ASD and broader atypical development were classified with approximately 71% AUC. Thus, prediction of ASD was only possible with moderate accuracy at 14 months.
Employment status is related to sleep problems in adults with autism spectrum disorder and no comorbid intellectual impairment.Both sleep problems and unemployment are common in adults with autism spectrum disorder; however, little research has explored this relationship in this population. This study aimed to explore factors that may be associated with the presence of an International Classification of Sleep Disorders-Third Edition defined sleep disorder in adults with autism spectrum disorder (IQ > 80). A total of 36 adults with autism spectrum disorder and 36 controls were included in the study. Participants completed a 14-day actigraphy assessment and questionnaire battery. Overall, 20 adults with autism spectrum disorder met the International Classification of Sleep Disorders-Third Edition criteria for insomnia and/or a circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder, while only 4 controls met criteria for these disorders. Adults with autism spectrum disorder and an International Classification of Sleep Disorders-Third Edition sleep disorder had higher scores on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and were more likely to be unemployed compared to adults with autism spectrum disorder and no sleep disorder. The findings demonstrate, for the first time, that sleep problems are associated with unemployment in adults with autism spectrum disorder. Further research exploring the direction of this effect is required; sleep problems that have developed during adolescence make attainment of employment for those with autism spectrum disorder difficult, or unemployment results in less restrictions required for optimal and appropriate sleep timing.
Behavioural and emotional disorders in childhood: A brief overview for paediatricians.Mental health problems in children and adolescents include several types of emotional and behavioural disorders, including disruptive, depression, anxiety and pervasive developmental (autism) disorders, characterized as either internalizing or externalizing problems. Disruptive behavioural problems such as temper tantrums, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional, defiant or conduct disorders are the commonest behavioural problems in preschool and school age children. The routine Paediatric clinic or Family Medicine/General Practitioner surgery presents with several desirable characteristics that make them ideal for providing effective mental health services to children and adolescents. DSM-5 and ICD-10 are the universally accepted standard criteria for the classification of mental and behaviour disorders in childhood and adults. The age and gender prevalence estimation of various childhood behavioural disorders are variable and difficult to compare worldwide. A review of relevant published literature was conducted, including published meta-analyses and national guidelines. We searched for articles indexed by Ovid, PubMed, PubMed Medical Central, CINAHL, EMBASE, Database of Abstracts and Reviews, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic reviews and other online sources. The searches were conducted using a combination of search expressions including "childhood", "behaviour", "disorders" or "problems". Childhood behaviour and emotional problems with their related disorders have significant negative impacts on the individual, the family and the society. They are commonly associated with poor academic, occupational, and psychosocial functioning. It is important for all healthcare professionals, especially the Paediatricians to be aware of the range of presentation, prevention and management of the common mental health problems in children and adolescents.
Lateral inhibition in the autism spectrum: An SSVEP study of visual cortical lateral interactions.Circuit level brain dysfunction has been suggested as a common mechanism through which diverse genetic risk factors and neurobiological sequelae lead to the core features of autism spectrum disorder (Geschwind 2009; Port et al. 2014). An important mediator of circuit level brain activity is lateral inhibition, and a number of authors have suggested that lateral inhibition may be atypical in ASD. However, evidence regarding putative atypical lateral connections in ASD is mixed. Here we employed a steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) paradigm to further investigate lateral connections within a group of high functioning adults with ASD. At a group level, we found no evidence of altered lateral interactions in ASD. Exploratory analyses reveal that greater ASD symptom severity (increased ADOS score) is associated with increased short range lateral inhibition. These results suggest that lateral interactions are not altered in ASD at a group-level, but that subtle alterations in such neurobiological processes may underlie the heterogeneity seen in the autism spectrum in terms of sensory perception and behavioral phenotype.
Mitochondrial dysfunction and autism: comprehensive genetic analyses of children with autism and mtDNA deletion.The etiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is very heterogeneous. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been described in ASD; however, primary mitochondrial disease has been genetically proven in a small subset of patients. The main goal of the present study was to investigate correlations between mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) changes and alterations of genes associated with mtDNA maintenance or ASD.
Evidence the U.S. autism epidemic initiated by acetaminophen (Tylenol) is aggravated by oral antibiotic amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin) and now exponentially by herbicide glyphosate (Roundup).Because certain hereditary diseases show autistic behavior, and autism often runs in families, researchers seek genes underlying the pathophysiology of autism, thus core behaviors. Other researchers argue environmental factors are decisive, citing compelling evidence of an autism epidemic in the United States beginning about 1980. Recognition that environmental factors influence gene expression led to synthesis of these views - an 'epigenetic epidemic' provoked by pervasive environmental agents altering expression of vulnerable genes, inducing characteristic autistic biochemistries in many mothers and infants. Two toxins most implicated in the U.S. autism epidemic are analgesic/antipyretic acetaminophen (Tylenol) and oral antibiotic amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin). Recently herbicide glyphosate (Roundup) was exponentially implicated. What do these toxins have in common? Acetaminophen depletes sulfate and glutathione required to detoxify it. Oral antibiotics kill and glyphosate inhibits intestinal bacteria that synthesize methionine (precursor of sulfate and glutathione, and required to methylate DNA), bacteria that synthesize tryptophan (sole precursor of neuroinhibitor serotonin), and bacteria that restrain ammonia-generating anaerobes. Sulfate plus glutathione normally sulfate fetal adrenal androgen dehydroepiandrosterone to DHEAS - major precursor of placental/postnatal estrogens. Glyphosate (and heavy metals) also inhibit aromatase that turns androgens to estrogens. Placental/postnatal estrogens dehydrate/mature brain myelin sheaths, mature corpus callosum and left hemisphere preferentially, dilate brain blood vessels, and elevate brain serotonin and oxytocin. Stress-induced weak androgens and estrogen depletion coherently explain white matter asymmetry and dysconnection in autism, extreme male brain, low brain blood flow, hyperexcitability, social anxiety, and insufficient maternal oxytocin at birth to limit fetal brain chloride/water and mature GABA.
Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC) Norms: A "Growth Chart" for ATEC Score Changes as a Function of Age.Most early-intervention Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) clinical trials are limited by the availability of psychometric technicians who assess each child's abilities before and after therapeutic intervention. If parents could administer regular psychometric evaluations of their children, then the cost of clinical trials will be reduced, enabling longer clinical trials with the larger number of participants. The Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC) was designed nearly two decades ago to provide such a tool, but the norms on the longitudinal changes in ATEC in the "treatment as usual" population were lacking. Here we report the norms of the observational cohort who voluntarily completed ATEC evaluations over the period of four years from 2013 to 2017.
Cognitive Functions and Neurodevelopmental Disorders Involving the Prefrontal Cortex and Mediodorsal Thalamus.The mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MD) has been implicated in executive functions (such as planning, cognitive control, working memory, and decision-making) because of its significant interconnectivity with the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Yet, whilst the roles of the PFC have been extensively studied, how the MD contributes to these cognitive functions remains relatively unclear. Recently, causal evidence in monkeys has demonstrated that in everyday tasks involving rapid updating (e.g., while learning something new, making decisions, or planning the next move), the MD and frontal cortex are working in close partnership. Furthermore, researchers studying the MD in rodents have been able to probe the underlying mechanisms of this relationship to give greater insights into how the frontal cortex and MD might interact during the performance of these essential tasks. This review summarizes the circuitry and known neuromodulators of the MD, and considers the most recent behavioral, cognitive, and neurophysiological studies conducted in monkeys and rodents; in total, this evidence demonstrates that MD makes a critical contribution to cognitive functions. We propose that communication occurs between the MD and the frontal cortex in an ongoing, fluid manner during
The Role of Neurohypophyseal Hormones Vasopressin and Oxytocin in Neuropsychiatric Disorders.Although the neurohypophyseal hormones vasopressin (VP) and oxytocin (OT) are mostly known for their role respectively in antidiuresis, and in labour, lactation and maternal behavior, both might exert widespread influences either on emotion and cognition in healthy subjects, showing some gender-related differences. They interact with each other facilitating shifts between positive socially- oriented and defensive states. In fact, VP amplifies the reactivity to stressors showing also beneficial effects on attention, verbal learning as well as memory, whereas OT reduces the amplitude of the stress response, improves emotion processing, and can play a negative effect on memory and verbal learning in healthy individuals. Several data indicate the possible involvement of these neuropeptides in the pathophysiology of psychiatric conditions involving social interactions, such as autism, as well as in schizophrenia and depression. The aim of this paper is to review the literature relating to the role played by neurohypophyseal hormones in neuropsychiatric disorders.
Reprint of "Investigating ensemble perception of emotions in autistic and typical children and adolescents".Ensemble perception, the ability to assess automatically the summary of large amounts of information presented in visual scenes, is available early in typical development. This ability might be compromised in autistic children, who are thought to present limitations in maintaining summary statistics representations for the recent history of sensory input. Here we examined ensemble perception of facial emotional expressions in 35 autistic children, 30 age- and ability-matched typical children and 25 typical adults. Participants received three tasks: a) an 'ensemble' emotion discrimination task; b) a baseline (single-face) emotion discrimination task; and c) a facial expression identification task. Children performed worse than adults on all three tasks. Unexpectedly, autistic and typical children were, on average, indistinguishable in their precision and accuracy on all three tasks. Computational modelling suggested that, on average, autistic and typical children used ensemble-encoding strategies to a similar extent; but ensemble perception was related to non-verbal reasoning abilities in autistic but not in typical children. Eye-movement data also showed no group differences in the way children attended to the stimuli. Our combined findings suggest that the abilities of autistic and typical children for ensemble perception of emotions are comparable on average.
Current status of vaccines in psychiatry-A narrative review.Vaccines are one of the newer therapeutic modalities being researched in psychiatric illnesses with limited role of pharmacological interventions. Preclinical studies on vaccines have shown favorable results in conditions like Substance use Disorders and Alzheimer's Dementia. However, the utility of Mumps Measles Rubella vaccine has been overshadowed by controversy linked to causation of Autism. With this background, the current narrative review aimed to comprehensively and critically evaluate the current status of vaccines in Psychiatric illnesses.
Tuberous sclerosis complex.Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal-dominant or sporadic multisystem disorder that results from mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2. The primary organs affected include the brain, skin, lung, kidney, and heart, all with variable frequency, penetrance, and severity. There are over 2000 known allelic variants for TSC, including nonsense and misssense mutation, and all pathogenic mutations are inactivating, leading to loss-of-function effects on the encoded proteins, TSC1 and TSC2. These proteins form a complex to constitutively inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling cascade, and as a consequence, mTOR signaling is constitutively active within all TSC-associated lesions. The mTOR inhibitors rapamycin (sirolimus) and everolimus have been shown to reduce renal and brain lesion size, and improve pulmonary function in TSC, and these compounds may also decrease seizure frequency. The clinical application of mTOR inhibitors in TSC has provided one of the first examples of precision medicine in a neurodevelopmental disorder.
The next vaccine-autism question: Are school-aged youth with autism spectrum disorder undervaccinated and, if so, why?Over the past two decades, the words 'autism' and 'vaccination' have often been linked and mired in controversy. In this commentary, we raise a different question about autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and vaccines: Are school-aged youth with ASD undervaccinated and, if so, why? There are several reasons why youth with ASD might be undervaccinated, including: belief in a vaccine-ASD link, challenges faced by youth with ASD when seeking health care and vaccine hesitancy factors that affect the general population. Possible undervaccination in this group is concerning given the prevalence of ASD and the key role of vaccinations in preventing infectious diseases. More research is needed to establish definitively whether youth with ASD are undervaccinated and to understand facilitators and barriers to vaccination for this population. This would help public health officials to develop and implement targeted policy and practice changes to increase vaccination uptake in youth with ASD, thereby increasing immunization equity.
The Emergence of Effortful Control in Young Boys With Fragile X Syndrome.Effortful control, or the ability to suppress a dominant response to perform a subdominant response, is an early-emerging temperament trait that is linked with positive social-emotional development. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a single-gene disorder characterized by hallmark regulatory impairments, suggesting diminished effortful control. This study compared the development of effortful control in preschool boys with FXS ( n = 97) and typical development ( n = 32). Unlike their typical peers, the boys with FXS did not exhibit growth in effortful control over time, which could not be accounted for by adaptive impairments, FMR1 molecular measures, or autism symptoms. These results contribute to our understanding of the childhood phenotype of FXS that may be linked to the poor social-emotional outcomes seen in this group.
Comparison of Treatment for Metabolic Disorders Associated with Autism:Reanalysis of Three Clinical Trials.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects about 1 in 45 individuals in the United States, yet effective treatments are yet to be defined. There is growing evidence that ASD is associated with abnormalities in several metabolic pathways, including the inter-connected folate, methylation and glutathione pathways. Several treatments that can therapeutically target these pathways have been tested in preliminary clinical trials. The combination of methylcobalamin (mB12) with low-dose folinic acid (LDFA) and sapropterin, a synthetic form of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) have been studied in open-label trials while high-dose folinic acid has been studied in a double-blind placebo controlled trial. All of these treatments have the potential to positively affect folate, methylation and glutathione pathways. Although the effect of mB12/LDFA and BH4 on methylation and glutathione metabolism have been examined in the open-label studies, these changes have not been compared to controls who received a placebo in order to account for the natural variation in the changes in these pathways. Furthermore, the recent study using high-dose folinic acid (HDFA) did not analyze the change in metabolism resulting from the treatment. Thus, we compared changes in methylation and glutathione metabolism and biomarkers of chronic oxidative stress as a result of these three treatments to individuals receiving placebo. In general, mB12/LDFA treatment had a significant effect on glutathione and cysteine metabolism with a medium effect size while BH4 had a significant effect on methylation and markers of chronic oxidative stress with a large effect size. HDFA treatment did not significantly influence biomarkers of methylation, glutathione or chronic oxidative stress. One caveat was that participants in the mB12/LDFA and BH4 studies had significantly worse markers of glutathione metabolism and chronic oxidative stress at baseline, respectively. Thus, the participants selected in these two clinical trials may have been those with the most severe metabolic abnormalities and most expected to respond to these treatments. Overall this study supports the notion that metabolic abnormalities in individuals with ASD may be amenable to targeted treatments and provide some insight into the mechanism of action of these treatments.
Are Psychotic Experiences Related to Poorer Reflective Reasoning? Cognitive biases play an important role in the formation and maintenance of delusions. These biases are indicators of a weak reflective mind, or reduced engaging in reflective and deliberate reasoning. In three experiments, we tested whether a bias to accept non-sense statements as profound, treat metaphorical statements as literal, and suppress intuitive responses is related to psychotic-like experiences.
Randomised controlled trial of simvastatin treatment for autism in young children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (SANTA).Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a monogenic model for syndromic autism. Statins rescue the social and cognitive phenotype in animal knockout models, but translational trials with subjects > 8 years using cognition/behaviour outcomes have shown mixed results. This trial breaks new ground by studying statin effects for the first time in younger children with NF1 and co-morbid autism and by using multiparametric imaging outcomes.
Social Media Use and Happiness in Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder.Social media (SM) use by adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is not well understood. Co-occurring mental health concerns, such as depression, are common for adults with ASD. The current investigation explored the relationship between SM use and happiness in a population of adults with self-disclosed ASD. Of the 84 percent of the sample who used SM, those who used Facebook, the most popular site, were happier than those who did not. The same relationship did not exist for the second most popular site, Twitter. Happiness and SM use showed a quadratic relationship: Happiness and SM use increased together until they reached a point where happiness fell off. SM use by adults with ASD, specifically Facebook use in moderation, may enhance well-being and may be a protective factor against secondary mental health concerns common in this population.
Differences in atypical resting-state effective connectivity distinguish autism from schizophrenia.Autism and schizophrenia share overlapping genetic etiology, common changes in brain structure and common cognitive deficits. A number of studies using resting state fMRI have shown that machine learning algorithms can distinguish between healthy controls and individuals diagnosed with either autism spectrum disorder or schizophrenia. However, it has not yet been determined whether machine learning algorithms can be used to distinguish between the two disorders. Using a linear support vector machine, we identify features that are most diagnostic for each disorder and successfully use them to classify an independent cohort of subjects. We find both common and divergent connectivity differences largely in the default mode network as well as in salience, and motor networks. Using divergent connectivity differences, we are able to distinguish autistic subjects from those with schizophrenia. Understanding the common and divergent connectivity changes associated with these disorders may provide a framework for understanding their shared cognitive deficits.
Neurodevelopmental disorders: prevalence and comorbidity in children referred to mental health services.Accurate prevalence rates of the neurodevelopmental disorders (ND) and comorbid conditions in child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) are essential for treatment planning and organization of health care. However, valid and reliable prevalence estimates from Nordic CAMHS populations are scarce, and the published findings vary.
Abnormal mTOR Activation in Autism.The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an important signaling hub that integrates environmental information regarding energy availability and stimulates anabolic molecular processes and cell growth. Abnormalities in this pathway have been identified in several syndromes in which autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is highly prevalent. Several studies have investigated mTOR signaling in developmental and neuronal processes that, when dysregulated, could contribute to the development of ASD. Although many potential mechanisms still remain to be fully understood, these associations are of great interest because of the clinical availability of mTOR inhibitors. Clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of mTOR inhibitors to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes have been initiated.
Drawing the answers: Sketching to support free and probed recall by child witnesses and victims with autism spectrum disorder.The success of witness interviews in the criminal justice system depends on the accuracy of information obtained, which is a function of both amount and quality of information. Attempts to enhance witness retrieval such as mental reinstatement of context have been designed with typically developed adults in mind. In this article, the relative benefits of mental and sketch reinstatement mnemonics are explored with both typically developing children and children with autism. Children watched a crime event video, and their retrieval of event information was examined in free and probed recall phases of a cognitive interview. As expected, typically developing children recalled more correct information of all types than children with autism during free and probed recall phases. Sketching during free recall was more beneficial for both groups in both phases in reducing the amount of incorrect items, but the relative effect of sketching on enhancing retrieval accuracy was greater for children with autism. The results indicate the benefits of choosing retrieval mnemonics that are sensitive to the specific impairments of autistic individuals and suggest that retrieval accuracy during interviews can be enhanced, in some cases to the same level as that of typically developing individuals.
Maternal and Early Postnatal Immune Activation Produce Dissociable Effects on Neurotransmission in mPFC-Amygdala Circuits.Inflammatory processes may be involved in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric illnesses including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Evidence from studies in rodents indicates that immune activation during early development can produce core features of ASD (social interaction deficits, dysregulation of communication, increases in stereotyped behaviors, and anxiety), although the neural mechanisms of these effects are not thoroughly understood. We treated timed-pregnant mice with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C), which simulates a viral infection, or vehicle on gestational day 12.5 to produce maternal immune activation (MIA). Male offspring received either vehicle or lipopolysaccharide, which simulates a bacterial infection, on postnatal day 9 to produce postnatal immune activation (PIA). We then used optogenetics to address the possibility that early developmental immune activation causes persistent alterations in the flow of signals within the mPFC to basolateral amygdala (BLA) pathway, a circuit implicated in ASD. We found that our MIA regimen produced increases in synaptic strength in glutamatergic projections from the mPFC to the BLA. In contrast, our PIA regimen produced decreases in feedforward GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic responses resulting from activation of local circuit interneurons in the BLA by mPFC-originating fibers. Both effects were seen together when the regimens were combined. Changes in the balance between excitation and inhibition were differentially translated into the modified spike output of BLA neurons. Our findings raise the possibility that prenatal and postnatal immune activation may affect different cellular targets within brain circuits that regulate some of the core behavioral signs of conditions such as ASD.
Effects of Prosodic and Semantic Cues on Facial Emotion Recognition in Relation to Autism-Like Traits.The current study investigated whether those with higher levels of autism-like traits process emotional information from speech differently to those with lower levels of autism-like traits. Neurotypical adults completed the autism-spectrum quotient and an emotional priming task. Vocal primes with varied emotional prosody, semantics, or a combination, preceded emotional target faces. Prime-target pairs were congruent or incongruent in their emotional content. Overall, congruency effects were found for combined prosody-semantic primes, however no congruency effects were found for semantic or prosodic primes alone. Further, those with higher levels of autism-like traits were not influenced by the prime stimuli. These results suggest that failure to integrate emotional information across modalities may be characteristic of the broader autism phenotype.
Exploring the social brain.How does the brain physiology of young children with autism differ from that of typically-developing children?
The Effect of Music on Exercise Intensity among Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Pilot Study.Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at risk for obesity, commonly have sleep disorders, and exhibit stereotypic behaviors that disrupt their learning. Vigorous levels of exercise have been shown to ameliorate these issues in children with ASD, but little research exists to provide techniques for motivating children with ASD to engage in exercise. The present study examined the effect of music on exercise intensity in a group of 13 elementary school students with ASD. Data were collected across six days during structured (e.g., verbal and physical prompts) and unstructured (e.g., minimal prompting) exercise periods. During these exercise periods, three music conditions were randomized: no music, slow-tempo music, and fast-tempo music. Exercise intensity, measured in Metabolic Equivalent of Tasks by triaxial accelerometers, was greatest during the structured exercise periods and during the slow music condition. Student characteristics moderated the impact of music condition on exercise intensity, such that students with high levels of adaptive behavior or lower levels of maladaptive behavior displayed greater exercise intensity during the fast music condition.
In the search for reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder: the role of vitamin D.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects about 1% of the world's population. Vitamin D is thought to be essential for normal brain development and modulation of the immune system. Worldwide about 1 billion people are affected by vitamin D deficiency. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) are biomarkers related to inflammation and oxidative stress. In the present study, these biomarkers were together with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D
The role of Pax6 in brain development and its impact on pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorder.Pax6 transcription factor is a key player in several aspects of brain development and function. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder in which several loci and/or genes have been suggested as causative candidate factors. Based on data obtained from meta-analyses of the transcriptome and ChIP analyses, we hypothesized that the neurodevelopmental gene PAX6 regulates and/or binds to a large number of genes (including many ASD-related ones) that modulate the fate of neural stem/progenitor cells and functions of neuronal cells, subsequently affecting animal behavior. Network analyses of PAX6/ASD-related molecules revealed significant clusters of molecular interactions involving regulation of cell-cell adhesion, ion transport, and transcriptional regulation. We discuss a novel function of Pax6 as a chromatin modulator that alters the chromatin status of ASD genes, thereby inducing diverse phenotypes of ASD and related neurodevelopmental diseases.
Executive function in high-functioning autism: Decision-making consistency as a characteristic gambling behaviour.Restricted and repetitive patterns of behaviours, interests, or activities are a critical diagnostic criterion for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Previous studies using gambling paradigms with ASD populations have identified that, unlike typically developed control participants, people with a diagnosis of ASD tend to maintain particular response patterns regardless of the magnitude of potential outcomes to uncertain gains or losses. Here we designed a gambling test that permitted calculation of the response consistency in gambling choices in situations that presented varying expected outcomes in terms of gains or losses. The task was administered to 33 adults with a diagnosis of ASDs and compared to a group of 47 typically-developed (TD) control participants who were matched for age and IQ. When presented with choices where participants could either make a risky gamble or a safe choice in terms of gains or losses (e.g., 20% chance of winning £5 vs. 100% chance of winning £1), the ASD participants did not differ from the TDs in their overall risk-taking behaviour. However, they were more consistent in their individual choices from trial to trial. Furthermore, the proportion of participants who either implemented an invariate response strategy (e.g., either always choosing the most risky or most "safe" option) was significantly higher in the ASD group compared with the controls. Additionally, while the ASD group were slower to make their responses in the win frame and the first half of the lose frame, by the end of the task their decision times were the same as the TD controls. These findings suggest that the ASD tendency towards repetitive behaviour may demonstrate itself even in high-level decision-making tasks, which needs to be understood if we are to be sure what such tasks are measuring.
Caregiver Mental Health, Parenting Practices, and Perceptions of Child Attachment in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.This paper investigates the role of caregiver mental health and parenting practices as predictors of attachment in children with intellectual disability/developmental delay, comparing between children with ASD (n = 29) and children with other developmental disabilities (n = 20). Parents reported that children with ASD had high levels of anxiety and stress, and attachment insecurity in children (less closeness and more conflict in attachment relationships, and more inhibited attachment behaviours) compared with children with other developmental disabilities. Children's attachment quality was associated with parenting practices and the presence of an ASD diagnosis. These results highlight the bidirectional nature of the quality of caregiving environments and attachment in children with ASD, and also provide a strong rationale for targeting children's attachment quality in early interventions.
The Scientific Study of Parents and Caregivers of Children with ASD: A Flourishing Field but Still Work to be Done.There is a long history of research on parents and caregivers of individuals within autism. Parents and other primary caregivers typically play the most important part in the lives of persons with ASD although the need for support as the child becomes of age varies widely. This special issue includes 30 articles on central areas related to parenting and caregiving for people with ASD. Some of the key themes include intervention and training, mental health issues related to parent and family stress, measurement and assessment, and parent-child transactional processes. Other articles in this issue consider different but equally important topics such as sibling as potential future caregivers and parent support of preschool peer relationships.
Gamma Oscillation Dysfunction in mPFC Leads to Social Deficits in Neuroligin 3 R451C Knockin Mice.Neuroligins (NLs) are critical for synapse formation and function. NL3 R451C is an autism-associated mutation. NL3 R451C knockin (KI) mice exhibit autistic behavioral abnormalities, including social novelty deficits. However, neither the brain regions involved in social novelty nor the underlying mechanisms are clearly understood. Here, we found decreased excitability of fast-spiking interneurons and dysfunction of gamma oscillation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which contributed to the social novelty deficit in the KI mice. Neuronal firing rates and phase-coding abnormalities were also detected in the KI mice during social interactions. Interestingly, optogenetic stimulation of parvalbumin interneurons in the mPFC at 40 Hz nested at 8 Hz positively modulated the social behaviors of mice and rescued the social novelty deficit in the KI mice. Our findings suggest that gamma oscillation dysfunction in the mPFC leads to social deficits in autism, and manipulating mPFC PV interneurons may reverse the deficits in adulthood.
Sex Differences in Autism Spectrum Disorder: a Review.Neurodevelopmental disorders disproportionately affect males. The mechanisms underlying male vulnerability or female protection are not known and remain understudied. Determining the processes involved is crucial to understanding the etiology and advancing treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we review current findings and theories that contribute to male preponderance of neurodevelopmental disorders, with a focus on autism.
Liver X receptor β regulates the development of the dentate gyrus and autistic-like behavior in the mouse.The dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus is a laminated brain region in which neurogenesis begins during early embryonic development and continues until adulthood. Recent studies have implicated that defects in the neurogenesis of the DG seem to be involved in the genesis of autism spectrum disorders (ASD)-like behaviors. Liver X receptor β (LXRβ) has recently emerged as an important transcription factor involved in the development of laminated CNS structures, but little is known about its role in the development of the DG. Here, we show that deletion of the LXRβ in mice causes hypoplasia in the DG, including abnormalities in the formation of progenitor cells and granule cell differentiation. We also found that expression of Notch1, a central mediator of progenitor cell self-renewal, is reduced in LXRβ-null mice. In addition, LXRβ deletion in mice results in autistic-like behaviors, including abnormal social interaction and repetitive behavior. These data reveal a central role for LXRβ in orchestrating the timely differentiation of neural progenitor cells within the DG, thereby providing a likely explanation for its association with the genesis of autism-related behaviors in LXRβ-deficient mice.
From intuition to intervention: developing an intonation-based treatment for autism.Autism affects ∼1.5% of children under age 8; its core symptoms include impairment in social-communicative functioning and repetitive behaviors/restricted interests. Music-based interventions have been considered one modality through which to treat autism. This report discusses considerations to take into account when developing a music-based intervention for a core symptom of autism. Treatment modality must be matched to symptom both clinically and theoretically, the behavior to be treated must be carefully defined and assessed, and outcome measures must be capable of showing improvement in that behavior over the course of the study. Fidelity assessment and rater blinding reduce experimenter bias. High inter-rater reliability for perceptually determined outcome measures helps obtain accurate estimates of treatment response. Later stages of testing compare the experimental intervention to matched control treatments or other validated therapies, isolating the intervention's "active ingredients." Such systematic investigation of a new music-based intervention can provide information of different types, ranging from an assessment of whether the intervention has any effect at all to an assessment of its outcomes and risks in uncontrolled community settings. Findings ultimately compose the evidence base that clinicians and families can use to decide the most effective way of addressing symptoms of autism for particular children.
Equivalence-based instruction of academic skills: Application to adolescents with autism.This study evaluated the efficacy of three equivalence-based instruction procedures on the acquisition of novel academic skills by 3 adolescents diagnosed with autism in a school setting. The skills targeted for instruction were related to topics in history, science, and mathematics, and were taught using different training structures from the PEAK-E curriculum. All participants demonstrated mastery of the trained relations and the tested derived relations following all variants of equivalence-based instruction.
The effectiveness of the peak relational training system and corresponding changes on the VB-MAPP for young adults with autism.The current investigation sought to extend prior research evaluating the use of the PEAK Relational Training System as a comprehensive treatment model in improving language skills demonstrated by individuals with autism. Baseline PEAK-Direct Training and Verbal Behavior Milestone Assessment and Placement Program (VB-MAPP) assessments were conducted across 3 adult male participants, and scores on the PEAK-Direct Training assessment were used to select targets for intervention. Language instruction guided by the PEAK-Direct Training module was implemented for 45 to 69 days across participants. Results suggest that participants mastered target skills throughout the training phase, and VB-MAPP test probes showed an increasing trend. Follow-up probes suggested that scores on the VB-MAPP maintained when training was discontinued. In addition, participants demonstrated an increase in assessment scores on the PEAK-Direct Training assessment in the follow-up phase, including the mastery of untargeted verbal skills.
A new measure of child vocal reciprocity in children with autism spectrum disorder.Children's vocal development occurs in the context of reciprocal exchanges with a communication partner who models "speechlike" productions. We propose a new measure of child vocal reciprocity, which we define as the degree to which an adult vocal response increases the probability of an immediately following child vocal response. Vocal reciprocity is likely to be associated with the speechlikeness of vocal communication in young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Two studies were conducted to test the utility of the new measure. The first used simulated vocal samples with randomly sequenced child and adult vocalizations to test the accuracy of the proposed index of child vocal reciprocity. The second was an empirical study of 21 children with ASD who were preverbal or in the early stages of language development. Daylong vocal samples collected in the natural environment were computer analyzed to derive the proposed index of child vocal reciprocity, which was highly stable when derived from two daylong vocal samples and was associated with speechlikeness of vocal communication. This association was significant even when controlling for chance probability of child vocalizations to adult vocal responses, probability of adult vocalizations, or probability of child vocalizations. A valid measure of children's vocal reciprocity might eventually improve our ability to predict which children are on track to develop useful speech and/or are most likely to respond to language intervention. A link to a free, publicly-available software program to derive the new measure of child vocal reciprocity is provided.

Mercury-associated diagnoses among children diagnosed with pervasive development disorders.Nelson and Bauman (Pediatrics 111:674-679, 2003) previously hypothesized that pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) was not associated with mercury (Hg) exposure because the medical conditions associated with Hg exposure were not associated with PDD. A hypothesis-testing longitudinal case-control study evaluated the frequency of medically diagnosed conditions previously associated with Hg poisoning, including: epilepsy, dysarthria, failure to thrive, cerebral palsy, or contact dermatitis and other eczema among children preceding their eventual PDD diagnosis (cases) compared to controls. A retrospective examination of medical records within the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) was undertaken. Cases diagnosed with PDD (n = 534) were born from 1991 to 2000 and continuously enrolled until their PDD diagnosis. Controls (n = 26,367) were born from 1991 to 1993 and continuously enrolled from birth for 7.22 years. Within the first 5 years of life, cases compared to controls were significantly (p < 0.0001) more likely to be assigned a diagnosis of contact dermatitis and other eczema (odds ratio (OR) = 2.033), dysarthria (OR = 23.992), epilepsy (OR = 5.351), failure to thrive (OR = 25.3), and cerebral palsy (OR = 4.464). Similar results were observed when the data were separated by gender. Overall, the results of the present study and recently published studies provide direct evidence supporting a link in twelve of twelve categories (100%) of Hg poisoning associated symptoms as defined by Nelson and Bauman (Pediatrics 111:674-679, 2003) and symptoms observed in those with a PDD diagnosis. The results of this study support the biological plausibility of Hg poisoning to induce PDD diagnoses and rejection of the Nelson and Bauman (Pediatrics 111:674-679, 2003) hypothesis because those with a PDD diagnosis have an increased frequency of conditions previously associated with Hg poisoning.
Teaching children with autism to explain how: A case for problem solving?Few studies have applied Skinner's (1953) conceptualization of problem solving to teach socially significant behaviors to individuals with developmental disabilities. The current study used a multiple probe design across behavior (sets) to evaluate the effects of problem-solving strategy training (PSST) on the target behavior of explaining how to complete familiar activities. During baseline, none of the three participants with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) could respond to the problems presented to them (i.e., explain how to do the activities). Tact training of the actions in each activity alone was ineffective; however, all participants demonstrated independent explaining-how following PSST. Further, following PSST with Set 1, tact training alone was sufficient for at least one scenario in sets 2 and 3 for all 3 participants. Results have implications for generative responding for individuals with ASD and further the discussion regarding the role of problem solving in complex verbal behavior.
Parent coaching increases the parents' capacity for reflection and self-evaluation: results from a clinical trial in autism.Family-centered parent coaching interventions in autism strive to encourage family engagement and support parent reflection and self-evaluation. This includes the parents' capacity to: (1) carefully observe the child's behavior; (2) reflect upon the child's thoughts, motives, and feelings; (3) consider links between the child's internal experiences and observable behavior; and (4) grapple with the complex interplay among the child's experiences and behaviors, contextual factors, parenting strategies, as well as parental goals and emotions. The current study reports data from a clinical trial of Focused Playtime Intervention (FPI), a parent coaching intervention targeting responsive parental behaviors and child communication. Seventy children with autism between 2 and 6 years and their parents were randomly assigned to participate in FPI for 12 weeks or an active control intervention. The Insightfulness Assessment was administered and used (a) to classify parents' baseline capacity for reflection and self-evaluation as either established (i.e., positively insightful) or emerging, and (b) to capture longitudinal change in the parents' capacity between baseline, exit (~5 months after baseline), and follow up (~14 months after exit) using a dimensional composite subscale score. Results revealed a significant treatment effect of FPI on growth in the parents' capacity for reflection and self-evaluation, conditional on the parents' classification at baseline. That is, parents whose capacity for reflection and self-evaluation was classified as emerging at baseline (n = 42) showed higher rates of growth when assigned to FPI, compared to the control condition. A similar treatment effect was not found for parents whose baseline capacity for reflection and self-evaluation was classified as established (i.e., positively insightful). This is the first study to show that a family-centered parent coaching intervention effectively increases the capacity for reflection and self-evaluation in parents of young children with autism. This capacity may enable parents to adapt and implement intervention strategies flexibly across contexts, daily routines, and interactions.
Anatomy-guided joint tissue segmentation and topological correction for 6-month infant brain MRI with risk of autism.Tissue segmentation of infant brain MRIs with risk of autism is critically important for characterizing early brain development and identifying biomarkers. However, it is challenging due to low tissue contrast caused by inherent ongoing myelination and maturation. In particular, at around 6 months of age, the voxel intensities in both gray matter and white matter are within similar ranges, thus leading to the lowest image contrast in the first postnatal year. Previous studies typically employed intensity images and tentatively estimated tissue probabilities to train a sequence of classifiers for tissue segmentation. However, the important prior knowledge of brain anatomy is largely ignored during the segmentation. Consequently, the segmentation accuracy is still limited and topological errors frequently exist, which will significantly degrade the performance of subsequent analyses. Although topological errors could be partially handled by retrospective topological correction methods, their results may still be anatomically incorrect. To address these challenges, in this article, we propose an anatomy-guided joint tissue segmentation and topological correction framework for isointense infant MRI. Particularly, we adopt a signed distance map with respect to the outer cortical surface as anatomical prior knowledge, and incorporate such prior information into the proposed framework to guide segmentation in ambiguous regions. Experimental results on the subjects acquired from National Database for Autism Research demonstrate the effectiveness to topological errors and also some levels of robustness to motion. Comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods further demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method in terms of both segmentation accuracy and topological correctness.
Prevalence of Co-occurring Medical and Behavioral Conditions/Symptoms Among 4- and 8-Year-Old Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder in Selected Areas of the United States in 2010.We compared the prevalence of various medical and behavioral co-occurring conditions/symptoms between 4- and 8-year-olds with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) from five sites in the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network during the 2010 survey year, accounting for sociodemographic differences. Over 95% of children had at least one co-occurring condition/symptom. Overall, the prevalence was higher in 8- than 4-year-olds for 67% of co-occurring conditions/symptoms examined. Further, our data suggested that co-occurring conditions/symptoms increased or decreased the age at which children were first evaluated for ASD. Similarly, among the 8-year-olds, the prevalence of most co-occurring conditions/symptoms was higher in children with a previous ASD diagnosis documented in their records. These findings are informative for understanding and screening co-occurring conditions/symptoms in ASD.
Association Study Between Metallothionein-3 Protein Polymorphisms and Autism.Genetic susceptibility to high mercury body burden has been suggested as an autism risk factor in children. Metallothionein III (MT3) is the brain-specific form of the metallothionein family, which plays a key role in metal metabolism. We therefore looked for genetic variations in the MT3 gene that might increase the predisposition to autism. DNA was extracted from 132 autistic children and 132 age and gender-matched unrelated controls. All the samples were analyzed for nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with minor allele frequency > 10% in the MT3 gene. The mRNA levels of MT3 in white blood cells were evaluated by real-time PCR. We did not detect any association between these MT3 polymorphisms and the mRNA levels of MT3. We did not detect any association between MT3 polymorphisms and autism risk. However, we detected four novel MT3 SNPs that are not in the human SNP database. The clinical importance of these SNPs needs further investigation. Our data suggest that MT3 gene polymorphisms are not associated with autism.
Reduced Alternating Gaze During Social Interaction in Infancy is Associated with Elevated Symptoms of Autism in Toddlerhood.In typical development, infants often alternate their gaze between their interaction partners and interesting stimuli, increasing the probability of joint attention toward surrounding objects and creating opportunities for communication and learning. Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have been found to engage less in behaviors that can initiate joint attention compared to typically developing children, but the role of such atypicalities in the development of ASD during infancy is not fully understood. Here, using eye tracking technology in a live setting, we show that 10-month-olds at high familial risk for ASD engage less in alternating gaze during interaction with an adult compared to low risk infants. These differences could not be explained by low general social preference or slow visual disengagement, as the groups performed similarly in these respects. We also found that less alternating gaze at 10 months was associated with more social ASD symptoms and less showing and pointing at 18 months. These relations were similar in both the high risk and the low risk groups, and remained when controlling for general social preference and disengagement latencies. This study shows that atypicalities in alternating gaze in infants at high risk for ASD emerge already during the first 10 months of life - a finding with theoretical as well as potential practical implications.
Aberrant Oscillatory Synchrony Is Biased Toward Specific Frequencies and Processing Domains in the Autistic Brain.Prevailing theories suggest that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) results from impaired brain communication, causing aberrant synchrony among neuronal populations. However, it remains debated whether synchrony abnormalities are among local or long-range circuits, are circuit specific or are generalized, reflect hypersynchrony or reflect hyposynchrony, and are frequency band-specific or are distributed across the frequency spectrum.
Eyeing up the Future of the Pupillary Light Reflex in Neurodiagnostics.The pupillary light reflex (PLR) describes the constriction and subsequent dilation of the pupil in response to light as a result of the antagonistic actions of the iris sphincter and dilator muscles. Since these muscles are innervated by the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems, respectively, different parameters of the PLR can be used as indicators for either sympathetic or parasympathetic modulation. Thus, the PLR provides an important metric of autonomic nervous system function that has been exploited for a wide range of clinical applications. Measurement of the PLR using dynamic pupillometry is now an established quantitative, non-invasive tool in assessment of traumatic head injuries. This review examines the more recent application of dynamic pupillometry as a diagnostic tool for a wide range of clinical conditions, varying from neurodegenerative disease to exposure to toxic chemicals, as well as its potential in the non-invasive diagnosis of infectious disease.
Attenuated behaviour in Cornelia de Lange and fragile X syndromes.Catatonia-like presentations in people with autism have been increasingly recognised within research and diagnostic guidelines. The recently developed Attenuated Behaviour Questionnaire has identified that attenuated behaviour [autistic catatonia] is very prevalent in people with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and associated with repetitive behaviour. In the current study, we investigated attenuated behaviour within two genetic syndromes associated with ASD and examined ASD and repetitive behaviour as longitudinal predictors of attenuated behaviour.
Prospective memory in autism: theory and literature review.The current article set out to review all research conducted to date investigating prospective memory (PM) in autism.
Psychiatric hospital treatment of youth with autism spectrum disorder in the United States: needs, outcomes, and policy.Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are admitted to inpatient psychiatric units at markedly high rates. As health insurance companies and government healthcare systems and regulators seek more evidence for healthcare outcomes, it is important to learn more about the effectiveness of psychiatric inpatient admissions for children with ASD to best inform decisions on provision and access to this level of care. Evidence for models of inpatient treatment for youth with ASD is presented, and key characteristics and consensus recommendations for care are discussed.
Effects of tributyltin on placental cytokine production.Objective Tributyltin (TBT) is a persistent pollutant but its effects on placental function are poorly understood as are its possible interactions with infection. We hypothesized that TBT alters the production of sex hormones and biomarkers for inflammation and neurodevelopment in an infection-dependent manner. Methods Placental explant cultures were treated with 0-5000 nM TBT in the presence and absence of Escherichia coli. A conditioned medium was harvested and concentrations of steroids (progesterone, P4; testosterone, T and estradiol, E2) as well as biomarkers of inflammation [interleukin (IL)-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), IL-10, IL-6, soluble glycoprotein 130 (sgp-130) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1)], oxidative stress [8-iso-prostaglandin (8-IsoP)] and neurodevelopment [brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)] were quantified. Results TBT increased P4 slightly but had little or no effect on T or E2 production. IL-1β, IL-6, sgp-130, IL-10 and 8-IsoP production was enhanced by TBT. P4 and IL-6 production was also enhanced by TBT for bacteria-stimulated cultures but TBT significantly inhibited bacteria-induced IL-1β and sgp-130 production. High doses of TBT also inhibited BDNF production. Conclusions TBT increases P4 but has minimal effect on downstream steroids. It enhances the production of inflammatory biomarkers such as IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-10 and IL-6. Inhibition of sgp-130 by TBT suggests that TBT may increase bioactive IL-6 production which has been associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. Reduced expression of BDNF also supports this possibility.
Towards a future molecular diagnosis of autism: Recent advances in biomarkers research from saliva samples.Autism spectrum disorder diagnosis is currently based on clinical observations and behavioral evaluations exclusively, without any biological determination. Molecular biomarkers are usually obtained from biological fluids, such as blood or urine, generally through invasive and uncomfortable procedures. Patients with autism are characterized by sensory reactivity and behavioral difficulties which make sample collection problematic. Saliva has emerged as a feasible alternative to obtain relevant biological information and is especially indicated in the case of children with autism due to its painless and noninvasive sampling characteristics. Furthermore, saliva represents a valuable resource to study candidate biomarkers of autism. This has resulted in a number of interesting studies reported during the last 5 years that we have gathered and briefly discussed.
The interaction of Matrix Reasoning and Social Motivation as predictors of Separation anxiety in boys with Autism Spectrum Disorder.It has been suggested that higher cognitive functioning based in the pre-frontal cortex is implicated in the ability of people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) to understand and communicate in social situations. Low motivation to engage in social interaction may also be influential in this process. Although both of these factors have been argued to influence the levels of comorbid anxiety in young people with ASD, no detailed examination of those relationships has been reported to date.
Early Origins of Autism Comorbidity: Neuropsychiatric Traits Correlated in Childhood Are Independent in Infancy.Previous research has suggested that behavioral comorbidity is the rule rather than the exception in autism. The present study aimed to trace the respective origins of autistic and general psychopathologic traits-and their association-to infancy. Measurements of autistic traits and early liability for general psychopathology were assessed in 314 twins at 18 months, ascertained from the general population using birth records. 222 twins were re-evaluated at 36 months. Standardized ratings of variation in social communication at 18 months were highly heritable and strongly predicted autistic trait scores at 36 months. These early indices of autistic liability were independent from contemporaneous ratings of behavior problems on the Brief Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (which were substantially environmentally-influenced), and did not meaningfully predict internalizing or externalizing scores on the Achenbach Scales of Empirically Based Assessment at 36 months. In this general population infant twin study, variation in social communication was independent from variation in other domains of general psychopathology, and exhibited a distinct genetic structure. The commonly-observed comorbidity of specific psychiatric syndromes with autism may arise from subsequent interactions between autistic liability and independent susceptibilities to other psychopathologic traits, suggesting opportunities for preventive amelioration of outcomes of these interactions over the course of development.
Receptive language is associated with visual perception in typically developing children and sensorimotor skills in autism spectrum conditions.A number of studies have evidenced marked difficulties in language in autism spectrum conditions (ASC). Studies have also shown that language and word knowledge are associated with the same area of brain that is also responsible for visual perception in typically developing (TD) individuals. However, in ASC, research suggests word meaning is mapped differently, on to situational sensorimotor components within the brain. Furthermore, motor coordination is associated with communication skills. The current study explores whether motor coordination and visual perception are impaired in children with ASC, and whether difficulties in coordination and visual perception correlate with receptive language levels. 36 children took part: 18 with ASC and 18 TD children, matched on age and non-verbal reasoning. Both groups completed the Movement ABC, Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration, British Picture Vocabulary Scale and Matrices (WASI). Results showed that ASC children scored significantly lower on receptive language, coordination and visual motor integration than the TD group. In the TD group receptive language significantly correlated with visual perception; in the ASC group receptive language significantly correlated with balance. These results imply that sensorimotor skills are associated with the understanding of language in ASC and thus the relationship between sensorimotor experiences and language warrants further investigation.
Autistic adults show preserved normalisation of sensory responses in gaze processing.Progress in our understanding of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has recently been sought by characterising how systematic differences in canonical neural computations employed across the sensory cortex might contribute to clinical symptoms in diverse sensory, cognitive, and social domains. A key proposal is that ASD is characterised by reduced divisive normalisation of sensory responses. This provides a bridge between genetic and molecular evidence for an increased ratio of cortical excitation to inhibition in ASD and the functional characteristics of sensory coding that are relevant for understanding perception and behaviour. Here we tested this hypothesis in the context of gaze processing (i.e., the perception of other people's direction of gaze), a domain with direct relevance to the core diagnostic features of ASD. We show that reduced divisive normalisation in gaze processing is associated with specific predictions regarding the psychophysical effects of sensory adaptation to gaze direction, and test these predictions in adults with ASD. We report compelling evidence that both divisive normalisation and sensory adaptation occur robustly in adults with ASD in the context of gaze processing. These results have important theoretical implications for defining the types of divisive computations that are likely to be intact or compromised in this condition (e.g., relating to local vs distal control of cortical gain). These results are also a strong testament to the typical sensory coding of gaze direction in ASD, despite the atypical responses to others' gaze that are a hallmark feature of this diagnosis.
Contemporary strategies for dissecting the neuronal basis of neurodevelopmental disorders.Great efforts in clinical and basic research have shown progress in understanding the neurobiological mechanisms of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, schizophrenia, and attention-deficit hyperactive disorders. Literature on this field have suggested that these disorders are affected by the complex interaction of genetic, biological, psychosocial and environmental risk factors. However, this complexity of interplaying risk factors during neurodevelopment has prevented a complete understanding of the causes of those neuropsychiatric symptoms. Recently, with advances in modern high-resolution neuroscience methods, the neural circuitry analysis approach has provided new solutions for understanding the causal relationship between dysfunction of a neural circuit and behavioral alteration in neurodevelopmental disorders. In this review we will discuss recent progress in developing novel optogenetic and chemogenetic strategies to investigate neurodevelopmental disorders.
Brief Report: Developmental Trajectories of Adaptive Behavior in Children and Adolescents with ASD.Research suggests that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have significant difficulties with adaptive behavior skills including daily living and functional communication skills. Few studies have examined the developmental trajectory of adaptive behavior across childhood and adolescence. The present study examined longitudinal trajectories of adaptive behavior in a community-based clinic sample of 186 individuals with ASD. The overall pattern indicated an initial increase in adaptive behavior during early childhood followed by a plateau in skills during adolescence for individuals of all IQ groups. Given the importance of adaptive behavior for employment and quality of life, this study emphasizes the importance of targeting adaptive behavior during adolescence to insure continued gains.
Cortical responses to dynamic emotional facial expressions generalize across stimuli, and are sensitive to task-relevance, in adults with and without Autism.Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) report difficulties extracting meaningful information from dynamic and complex social cues, like facial expressions. The nature and mechanisms of these difficulties remain unclear. Here we tested whether that difficulty can be traced to the pattern of activity in "social brain" regions, when viewing dynamic facial expressions. In two studies, adult participants (male and female) watched brief videos of a range of positive and negative facial expressions, while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (Study 1: ASD n = 16, control n = 21; Study 2: ASD n = 22, control n = 30). Patterns of hemodynamic activity differentiated among facial emotional expressions in left and right superior temporal sulcus, fusiform gyrus, and parts of medial prefrontal cortex. In both control participants and high-functioning individuals with ASD, we observed (i) similar responses to emotional valence that generalized across facial expressions and animated social events; (ii) similar flexibility of responses to emotional valence, when manipulating the task-relevance of perceived emotions; and (iii) similar responses to a range of emotions within valence. Altogether, the data indicate that there was little or no group difference in cortical responses to isolated dynamic emotional facial expressions, as measured with fMRI. Difficulties with real-world social communication and social interaction in ASD may instead reflect differences in initiating and maintaining contingent interactions, or in integrating social information over time or context.
Characterization of Noise Signatures of Involuntary Head Motion in the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange Repository.The variability inherently present in biophysical data is partly contributed by disparate sampling resolutions across instrumentations. This poses a potential problem for statistical inference using pooled data in open access repositories. Such repositories combine data collected from multiple research sites using variable sampling resolutions. One example is the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange repository containing thousands of imaging and demographic records from participants in the spectrum of autism and age-matched neurotypical controls. Further, statistical analyses of groups from different diagnoses and demographics may be challenging, owing to the disparate number of participants across different clinical subgroups. In this paper, we examine the noise signatures of head motion data extracted from resting state fMRI data harnessed under different sampling resolutions. We characterize the quality of the noise in the variability of the raw linear and angular speeds for different clinical phenotypes in relation to age-matched controls. Further, we use bootstrapping methods to ensure compatible group sizes for statistical comparison and report the ranges of physical involuntary head excursions of these groups. We conclude that different sampling rates do affect the quality of noise in the variability of head motion data and, consequently, the type of random process appropriate to characterize the time series data. Further, given a qualitative range of noise, from pink to brown noise, it is possible to characterize different clinical subtypes and distinguish them in relation to ranges of neurotypical controls. These results may be of relevance to the pre-processing stages of the pipeline of analyses of resting state fMRI data, whereby head motion enters the criteria to clean imaging data from motion artifacts.
A Preliminary Analysis of Mastery Criterion Level: Effects on Response Maintenance.Educators use a mastery criterion to evaluate skill acquisition programming for children with autism and other developmental disabilities; however, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no research evaluating how the mastery criterion level of accuracy affects the maintenance of those responses. This study investigated the effects of 3 skill acquisition mastery criterion levels (50%, 80%, and 90% accuracy) on response maintenance. Following mastery of a set of skills, maintenance was evaluated once a week for 3 to 4 weeks. Three elementary school-age children diagnosed with autism participated. Overall, the outcomes suggested that higher mastery criterion levels (90% correct) produced higher levels of maintenance responding. Additional research in this area is needed to clarify how different parameters of mastery criterion affect the generality of skills.
A Preliminary Procedure for Teaching Children with Autism to Mand for Social Information.We used procedures established within the mands for information literature to teach two children with autism to mand for social information. Establishing operation trials were alternated with abolishing operation trials to verify the function of the responses as mands. Use of the acquired information was evaluated by examining responding to questions about their social partner. Both participants acquired mands for social information and showed generalization to novel social partners.
Neuron numbers increase in the human amygdala from birth to adulthood, but not in autism.Remarkably little is known about the postnatal cellular development of the human amygdala. It plays a central role in mediating emotional behavior and has an unusually protracted development well into adulthood, increasing in size by 40% from youth to adulthood. Variation from this typical neurodevelopmental trajectory could have profound implications on normal emotional development. We report the results of a stereological analysis of the number of neurons in amygdala nuclei of 52 human brains ranging from 2 to 48 years of age [24 neurotypical and 28 autism spectrum disorder (ASD)]. In neurotypical development, the number of mature neurons in the basal and accessory basal nuclei increases from childhood to adulthood, coinciding with a decrease of immature neurons within the paralaminar nucleus. Individuals with ASD, in contrast, show an initial excess of amygdala neurons during childhood, followed by a reduction in adulthood across nuclei. We propose that there is a long-term contribution of mature neurons from the paralaminar nucleus to other nuclei of the neurotypical human amygdala and that this growth trajectory may be altered in ASD, potentially underlying the volumetric changes detected in ASD and other neurodevelopmental or neuropsychiatric disorders.
Neuropsychiatric disease-associated genetic variants of the dopamine transporter display heterogeneous molecular phenotypes.Genetic factors are known to significantly contribute to the etiology of psychiatric diseases such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum and bipolar disorders, but the underlying molecular processes remain largely elusive. The dopamine transporter (DAT) has received continuous attention as a potential risk factor for psychiatric disease, as it is critical for dopamine homeostasis and serves as principal target for ADHD medications. Constrain metrics for the DAT-encoding gene, solute carrier family 6 member 3 (
Brief Report: Parent's Assessments of Their Care-Related Stress and Child's ASD Symptoms in Relation to Their child's Intervention History.Parenting a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be stressful. Understanding parent's perceptions of their stress and their child's ASD-related symptoms is important for both the well-being of parent and child and for other reasons, such as intervention adherence and diagnostic accuracy. We report parent (N = 570) ratings of both their ASD Care-Related Stress scores and their child's symptoms in relation to the child's exposure to five mainstream ASD interventions. Differences across intervention history in the way parents perceive their child's symptoms and rate the stressfulness of performing ASD-related parenting duties were found.
Similarly Expanded Bilateral Temporal Lobe Volumes in Female and Male Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is more prevalent in male than female individuals. Very few studies have examined sex modulations of brain anatomical differences between individuals with ASD and typically developing (TD) individuals, especially in children. The current study aimed to identify sex-dependent and/or sex-independent neuroanatomical mechanisms underlying ASD.
Comprehensive Nutritional and Dietary Intervention for Autism Spectrum Disorder-A Randomized, Controlled 12-Month Trial.This study involved a randomized, controlled, single-blind 12-month treatment study of a comprehensive nutritional and dietary intervention. Participants were 67 children and adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) ages 3-58 years from Arizona and 50 non-sibling neurotypical controls of similar age and gender. Treatment began with a special vitamin/mineral supplement, and additional treatments were added sequentially, including essential fatty acids, Epsom salt baths, carnitine, digestive enzymes, and a healthy gluten-free, casein-free, soy-free (HGCSF) diet. There was a significant improvement in nonverbal intellectual ability in the treatment group compared to the non-treatment group (+6.7 ± 11 IQ points vs. -0.6 ± 11 IQ points,
Consistent hypersocial behavior in mice carrying a deletion of Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a developmental disorder caused by hemizygous deletion of human chromosome 7q11.23. Hypersocial behavior is one symptom of WBS and contrasts with hyposociality observed in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Interestingly, duplications of 7q11.23 have been associated with ASD. The social phenotype of WBS has been linked to
Impaired lipid metabolism markers to assess the risk of neuroinflammation in autism spectrum disorder.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a multifactorial disorder caused by an interaction between environmental risk factors and a genetic background. It is characterized by impairment in communication, social interaction, repetitive behavior, and sensory processing. The etiology of ASD is still not fully understood, and the role of neuroinflammation in autism behaviors needs to be further investigated. The aim of the present study was to test the possible association between prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1), prostaglandin PGE2 EP2 receptors and nuclear kappa B (NF-κB) and the severity of cognitive disorders, social impairment, and sensory dysfunction. PGE2, COX-2, mPGES-1, PGE2-EP2 receptors and NF-κB as biochemical parameters related to neuroinflammation were determined in the plasma of 47 Saudi male patients with ASD, categorized as mild to moderate and severe as indicated by the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) or the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) or the Short Sensory Profile (SSP) and compared to 46 neurotypical controls. The data indicated that ASD patients have remarkably higher levels of the measured parameters compared to neurotypical controls, except for EP2 receptors that showed an opposite trend. While the measured parameter did not correlate with the severity of social and cognitive dysfunction, PGE2, COX-2, and mPGES-1 were remarkably associated with the dysfunction in sensory processing. NF-κB was significantly increased in relation to age. Based on the discussed data, the positive correlation between PGE2, COX-2, and mPGES-1 confirm the role of PGE2 pathway and neuroinflammation in the etiology of ASD, and the possibility of using PGE2, COX-2 and mPGES-1 as biomarkers of autism severity. NF-κB as inflammatory inducer showed an elevated level in plasma of ASD individuals. Receiver operating characteristic analysis together with predictiveness diagrams proved that the measured parameters could be used as predictive biomarkers of biochemical correlates to ASD.
Differential immune responses and microbiota profiles in children with autism spectrum disorders and co-morbid gastrointestinal symptoms.Many studies have reported the increased presence of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Altered microbiome profiles, pro-inflammatory responses and impaired intestinal permeability have been observed in children with ASD and co-morbid GI symptoms, yet few studies have compared these findings to ASD children without GI issues or similarly aged typical developing children. The aim of this study was to determine whether there are biological signatures in terms of immune dysfunction and microbiota composition in children with ASD with GI symptoms.
Cell-Type-Specific Shank2 is an excitatory postsynaptic scaffolding protein implicated in synaptic regulation and psychiatric disorders including autism spectrum disorders. Conventional
Modeling autism in non-human primates: Opportunities and challenges.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social communication deficits and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior. For more than a decade, genetically-modified, risk factor-induced, as well as naturally occurring rodent models for ASD have been used as the most predominant tools to dissect the molecular and circuitry mechanisms underlying ASD. However, the apparent evolutionary differences in terms of social behavior and brain anatomy between rodents and humans have become an issue of debate regarding the translational value of rodent models for studying ASD. More recently, genome manipulation of non human primates using lentivirus-based gene expression, TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene editing techniques, has been reported. Genetically modified non-human primate models for ASD have been produced and characterized. While the feasibility, value, and exciting opportunities provided by the non-human primate models have been clearly demonstrated, many challenges still remain. Here, we review current progress, discuss the remaining challenges, and highlight the key issues in the development of non-human primate models for ASD research and drug development.

The risk of neurodevelopmental disorders following Thimerosal-containing Hib vaccine in comparison to Thimerosal-free Hib vaccine administered from 1995 to 1999 in the United States.Investigators postulated that early-life exposure to organic mercury (Hg) significantly increases the risk of childhood neurodevelopmental disorders (NDs). The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System database was utilized to conduct a hypothesis testing case-control study by evaluating 3486 total adverse event reports reported following Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib) vaccination. Exposed subjects received a Thimerosal-containing formulation (HIBTITER™, Wyeth-Lederle), while unexposed subjects received a Thimerosal-free formulation (PEDVAXHIB™, Merck). Subjects were included if they received either of these two Hib vaccine formulations between 1995 and 1999. Cases were defined as adverse event reports with a reported outcome of autism, developmental delay, psychomotor delay, or NDs in general. Cases with reported outcomes of febrile convulsions, pyrexia, or injection site pain, all of which have no biologically plausible relation to Hg exposure, were also examined. Controls were defined as adverse event reports without any mention of the specific case outcome examined. Cases of reported autism (odds ratio (OR) = 2.75, p < 0.02), developmental delay (OR = 5.39, p < 0.01), psychomotor disorder (OR = 2.38, p < 0.03), and neurodevelopmental disorder in general (OR = 2.70, p < 0.001) were each significantly more likely than their respective controls to receive Thimerosal-containing Hib vaccine than Thimerosal-free Hib vaccine. Significant effects for neurodevelopmental disorder in general were observed for males (OR = 2.52, p < 0.005), but not females when separated by gender. For the outcomes that had no biologically plausible relation to Hg exposure, the cases were no more likely than their respective controls to receive Thimerosal-containing Hib vaccine than Thimerosal-free Hib vaccine. This study provides suggestive evidence of an association between Thimerosal and neurodevelopmental outcomes and provides support for carrying out additional well-designed studies examining the association between Thimerosal-containing vaccines and a wide range of neurodevelopmental outcomes.
Atypical audiovisual temporal function in autism and schizophrenia: similar phenotype, different cause.Binding across sensory modalities yields substantial perceptual benefits, including enhanced speech intelligibility. The coincidence of sensory inputs across time is a fundamental cue for this integration process. Recent work has suggested that individuals with diagnoses of schizophrenia (SZ) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) will characterize auditory and visual events as synchronous over larger temporal disparities than their neurotypical counterparts. Namely, these clinical populations possess an enlarged temporal binding window (TBW). Although patients with SZ and ASD share aspects of their symptomatology, phenotypic similarities may result from distinct etiologies. To examine similarities and variances in audiovisual temporal function in these two populations, individuals diagnosed with ASD (n = 46; controls n = 40) and SZ (n = 16, controls = 16) completed an audiovisual simultaneity judgment task. In addition to standard psychometric analyses, synchrony judgments were assessed using Bayesian causal inference modeling. This approach permits distinguishing between distinct causes of an enlarged TBW: an a priori bias to bind sensory information and poor fidelity in the sensory representation. Findings indicate that both ASD and SZ populations show deficits in multisensory temporal acuity. Importantly, results suggest that while the wider TBWs in ASD most prominently results from atypical priors, the wider TBWs in SZ results from a trend toward changes in prior and weaknesses in the sensory representations. Results are discussed in light of current ASD and SZ theories and highlight that different perceptual training paradigms focused on improving multisensory integration may be most effective in these two clinical populations and emphasize that similar phenotypes may emanate from distinct mechanistic causes.
Gaze Following is Related to the Broader Autism Phenotype in a Sex-Specific Way: Building the Case for Distinct Male and Female Autism Phenotypes.The search for a female autism phenotype is difficult, given the low diagnostic rates in females. Here, we studied potential sex differences in a core feature of autism, difficulty with eye gaze processing, among typically developing individuals who vary in the broad autism phenotype, which includes autistic-like traits that are common, continuously distributed, and similarly heritable in males and females. Participants viewed complex images of an actor in a naturalistic scene looking at one of many possible objects and had to identify the target gazed-at object. Among males, those high in autistic-like traits exhibited worse eye gaze following performance than did those low in these traits. Among females, eye gaze following behavior did not vary with autistic-like traits. These results suggest that deficient eye gaze following behavior is part of the broader autism phenotype for males, but may not be a part of the female autism phenotype.
Cluster analysis of autism spectrum disorder symptomatology: Qualitatively distinct subtypes or quantitative degrees of severity of a single disorder?The decision to collapse several related disorders into a single diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) generated significant controversy and debate. There has been mixed evidence as to whether various ASD subtypes are qualitatively distinct or if they exist on a spectrum of symptom severity. The present study conducted a two-step cluster analysis of major ASD symptoms in a sample of 147 young males with ASD aged between 6yr and 18yr with IQ > 70. Results indicated that a two-cluster solution (high and low severity of ASD symptomatology) was reliable and valid. Further, the construct of challenging behaviour was not a necessary component of the two-cluster solution, verifying the new conceptualisation of ASD. Further replication of these findings with other subsets of individuals with ASD is needed.
Education and employment status of adults with autism spectrum disorders in Germany - a cross-sectional-survey.Adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) experience challenges in participating in the labour market and struggle to achieve and maintain appropriate professional positions, possibly due to impairments of communication and social interaction. Studies have shown high rates of unemployment as well as evidence of inadequate employment. As knowledge on the participation in the German labour market is scarce, the aim of our study was to examine employment status, type of occupation and inadequate employment in a sample of clinically mostly late-diagnosed and most likely not intellectually disabled adults with ASD in Germany.
Probiotic treatment reduces the autistic-like excitation/inhibition imbalance in juvenile hamsters induced by orally administered propionic acid and clindamycin.Increasing evidence suggests that the gut microbiota plays a key role in the central nervous system (CNS), and alterations of the gut microbiota composition due to environmental factors can contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders. Animal modeling may help to identify drugs that can normalize the altered gut microbiota and thereby ameliorate abnormal brain signaling pathways. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the therapeutic potency of probiotics such as Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli on glutamate excitotoxicity as a neurotoxic effect induced by clindamycin and propionic acid (PPA) in juvenile hamsters. Fifty young golden Syrian hamsters weighing between 60 and 70 g were enrolled in the study. The hamsters were randomly divided into five groups, each with ten hamsters. The hamsters in the control group only received phosphate-buffered saline orally. The PPA-treated group received a neurotoxic dose of 250 mg PPA/kg body weight (BW)/day for three days. The clindamycin-treated group received 30 mg clindamycin/kg BW as a single orogastric dose on the day the experiment started. The two therapeutic groups received the same doses of PPA and clindamycin followed by 0.2 g probiotic/kg BW for three weeks. Biochemical parameters related to glutamate excitotoxicity were investigated in brain homogenates from each group of hamsters. Additionally, the development of pathogenic bacteria was monitored in stool samples from all groups. The microbiology results of the present study revealed descriptive changes in the fecal microbiota and the appearance of Clostridium species in the hamsters treated with clindamycin and PPA. Additionally, the effectiveness of the probiotic in the restoration of the normal gut microbiota was demonstrated. Moreover, clindamycin and PPA were found to induce a significant depletion of Mg
Maternal Thyroid Function in Early Pregnancy and Child Neurodevelopmental Disorders: A Danish Nationwide Case-Cohort Study.Maternal thyroid dysfunction may adversely affect fetal brain development, but more evidence is needed to refine this hypothesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate potential fetal programming by abnormal maternal thyroid function on child neurodevelopmental disorders.
Elevated polygenic burden for autism is associated with differential DNA methylation at birth.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social communication and restricted, repetitive behaviors, interests, or activities. The etiology of ASD involves both inherited and environmental risk factors, with epigenetic processes hypothesized as one mechanism by which both genetic and non-genetic variation influence gene regulation and pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to identify DNA methylation biomarkers of ASD detectable at birth.
A Systematic Review of Caregiver-Implemented Mealtime Interventions for Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder.Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) frequently have difficult mealtimes. A systematic review analyzed current evidence relevant to occupational therapy (OT) and mealtime interventions (a) for children with ASD, (b) occurring in the natural contexts, and (c) with parents/caregivers as interventionists. Database search identified 13 relevant articles. Each article was reviewed for practicality of implementation through a modified Feasibility, Appropriateness, Meaningfulness and Effectiveness (FAME) scale and for quality of research design using three measures specifically designed for single-case experimental design research. The majority of articles reviewed demonstrated rigorous research design with strong evidence for the effectiveness of caregiver-implemented interventions. Six intervention techniques were identified, with all studies using a reinforcement strategy and at least one other technique. This review identifies evidence-based practices for OTs to support children with ASD and their families within the natural co-occupation of mealtimes. Effective techniques and recommendations for practice are included.
Neural Dynamics of Autistic Repetitive Behaviors and Fragile X Syndrome: Basal Ganglia Movement Gating and mGluR-Modulated Adaptively Timed Learning.This article develops the iSTART neural model that proposes how specific imbalances in cognitive, emotional, timing, and motor processes that involve brain regions like prefrontal cortex, temporal cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum may interact together to cause behavioral symptoms of autism. These imbalances include underaroused emotional depression in the amygdala/hypothalamus, learning of hyperspecific recognition categories that help to cause narrowly focused attention in temporal and prefrontal cortices, and breakdowns of adaptively timed motivated attention and motor circuits in the hippocampus and cerebellum. The article expands the model's explanatory range by, first, explaining recent data about Fragile X syndrome (FXS), mGluR, and trace conditioning; and, second, by explaining distinct causes of stereotyped behaviors in individuals with autism. Some of these stereotyped behaviors, such as an insistence on sameness and circumscribed interests, may result from imbalances in the cognitive and emotional circuits that iSTART models. These behaviors may be ameliorated by operant conditioning methods. Other stereotyped behaviors, such as repetitive motor behaviors, may result from imbalances in how the direct and indirect pathways of the basal ganglia open or close movement gates, respectively. These repetitive behaviors may be ameliorated by drugs that augment D2 dopamine receptor responses or reduce D1 dopamine receptor responses. The article also notes the ubiquitous role of gating by basal ganglia loops in regulating all the functions that iSTART models.
Affectionate Interactions of Cats with Children Having Autism Spectrum Disorder.Mental and physical benefits of dogs have been reported for adults and children with special needs, but less is known about benefits of cats for children. A cat that can be held by a child could provide important therapeutic companionship for children with severe or less severe autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who otherwise may lack prosocial behaviors. Because relatively little is known about the behavior of cats around children, we conducted this study. Phase 1 gathered web-survey data from families having an adult cat and a child with ASD (
Concordance between physiological arousal and emotion expression during fear in young children with autism spectrum disorders.This study aimed to measure emotional expression and physiological arousal in response to fear in 21 children with autism spectrum disorders (43-75 months) and 45 typically developing children (41-81 months). Expressions of facial and bodily fear and heart rate arousal were simultaneously measured in response to a remote controlled robot (Laboratory Temperament Assessment Battery). Heart rate analyses revealed a main effect of task from baseline to fear ( p < 0.001, [Formula: see text]), no interaction effect and no effect for group. In addition, children with autism spectrum disorder showed intact facial and bodily expressions of fearful affect compared to typically developing children. With regard to the relationship between expression and arousal, the results provided evidence for concordance between expression and arousal in typically developing children ( r = 0.45, n = 45, p < 0.01). For children with autism spectrum disorder, no significant correlation was found ( r = 0.20, n = 21, p = 0.38). A moderation analysis revealed no significant interaction between expression and arousal for children with and without autism spectrum disorder ( F(1, 62) = 1.23, p = 0.27, [Formula: see text]), which might be the result of limited power. The current results give reason to further study concordance between expression and arousal in early autism spectrum disorder. Discordance might significantly impact social functioning and is an important topic in light of both early identification and treatment.
Scoping the evidence for EarlyBird and EarlyBird Plus, two United Kingdom-developed parent education training programmes for autism spectrum disorder.EarlyBird and EarlyBird Plus are parent education and training programmes designed by the UK National Autistic Society in 1997 and 2003, having been delivered to more than 27,000 families in 14 countries. These group-based programmes aim to (1) support parents immediately after diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, (2) empower parents, encouraging a positive perception of their child's autism spectrum disorder and (3) help parents establish good practice. In the absence of any previous comprehensive review, we performed a scoping review of all peer-reviewed publications on EarlyBird/EarlyBird Plus. A search was conducted between February and June 2016 using EbscoHost, Sabinet, SAGE Journals, Directory of Open Access Journals, BioMed Central, Scopus, ScienceDirect and grey literature. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion. In total, 18 articles were identified: 16 from the United Kingdom and 2 from New Zealand. We reviewed the context, study populations, design, outcome measures, whether focus was on parental perception, parental change or child changes and programme feasibility. Strong parental support for the acceptability but lower level evidence of efficacy of EarlyBird/EarlyBird Plus was found. Future research should consider randomised controlled trials. There is no research on EarlyBird/EarlyBird Plus in low-resource settings; therefore, we recommend broader feasibility evaluation of EarlyBird/EarlyBird Plus including accessibility, cultural appropriateness and scalability.
Cytokine profile in autistic patients.The etiology of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) as severe neurodevelopmental ailments is not known. However, several evidences point to dysregulation of immune system as an underlying cause of ASD. In the present study we evaluated the mRNA expression levels of TNF-α, TGF-β, IFN-γ, CXCL8, IL-1β, IL-2, 1L-4, IL-6, IL-17 in whole blood samples of 30 ASD patients and 41 age and sex-matched healthy subjects with means of real-time PCR. TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-17 have been shown to be significantly up-regulated in ASD patients compared with healthy subjects (P < 0.0001, P = 0.001 and P < 0.0001 respectively). IL-2 has been shown to be significantly down-regulated in total ASD patients (P < 0.0001). No significant difference has been found in expression levels of other cytokines between patients and healthy subjects. The present study provides further evidences for dysregulation of immune response in ASD patients.
Chinese children with autism: A multiple chemical elements profile in erythrocytes.Several lines of evidence suggested that abnormal levels of certain chemical elements may contribute to the development of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The present work aimed to investigate the multiple chemical elements profile in the erythrocytes of autistic versus typically developing children (TDC) of China. Analyses were carried out to explore the possible association between levels of elements and the risk as well as the severity of ASD. Erythrocyte levels of 11 elements (32%) among 34 detected elements in autistic group were significantly different from those in the TDC group. To our knowledge, this is the first study which compared the levels of rare earth elements in erythrocytes between children with or without ASD. Five elements including Pb, Na, Ca, Sb, and La are associated with the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) total score. Also, a series of tendencies were found in this research which was believed to affect auditory response, taste, smell, and touch, as well as fear or nervousness. It can be concluded that Chinese autistic children suffer from multi-chemical element imbalances which involves a complex combination of genetic and environmental factors. The results showed a significant correlation between abnormal levels of several chemical elements and the severity of the autistic syndrome.
Translation-relevant EEG phenotypes in a mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome.Identification of comparable biomarkers in humans and validated animal models will facilitate pre-clinical to clinical therapeutic pipelines to treat neurodevelopmental disorders. Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a leading known genetic cause of intellectual disability with symptoms that include increased anxiety, social and sensory processing deficits. Recent EEG studies in humans with FXS have identified neural oscillation deficits that include enhanced resting state gamma power and reduced inter-trial coherence of sound evoked gamma oscillations. To determine if analogous phenotypes are present in an animal model of FXS, we recorded EEGs in awake, freely moving Fmr1 knock out (KO) mice using similar stimuli as in the human studies. We report remarkably similar neural oscillation phenotypes in the Fmr1 KO mouse including enhanced resting state gamma power and reduced evoked gamma synchronization. The gamma band inter-trial coherence of neural response was reduced in both auditory and frontal cortex of Fmr1 KO mice stimulated with a sound whose envelope was modulated from 1 to 100 Hz, similar to that seen in humans with FXS. These deficits suggest a form of enhanced 'resting state noise' that interferes with the ability of the circuit to mount a synchronized response to sensory input, predicting specific sensory and cognitive deficits in FXS. The abnormal gamma oscillations are consistent with parvalbumin neuron and perineuronal net deficits seen in the Fmr1 KO mouse auditory cortex indicating that the EEG biomarkers are not only clinically relevant, but could also be used to probe cellular and circuit mechanisms of sensory hypersensitivity in FXS.
Risk factors and topographies for self-injurious behaviour in a sample of adults with intellectual developmental disorders.Self-injurious behaviour (SIB) is a prevalent form of challenging behaviour in people with intellectual developmental disorders (IDD). Existing research has yielded conflicting findings concerning the major risk factors involved, and in addition, SIB shows multiple topographies and presentations. Although presence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and severity of intellectual disability (ID) are known risk factors for SIB, there are no studies comparing SIB topographies by severity degrees of ID and ASD. The purpose of the present paper has been to identify risk factors and topographies for SIB in a representative, stratified and randomised sample of adults with IDD.
Concurrent Validity of Two Standardized Measures of Gross Motor Function in Young Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.This study provides information on how two standardized measures based on different theoretical frameworks can be used in collecting information on motor development and performance in 4- and 5-year-olds with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The purpose of the study was to determine the concurrent validity of the Miller Function and Participation Scales (M-FUN) with the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales, Second Edition (PDMS-2) in young children with ASD.
The Utility of Measuring Intentions to Use Best Practices: A Longitudinal Study Among Teachers Supporting Students With Autism.School-based interventions can result in profound social, behavioral, and academic improvement for students with autism, but teachers rarely implement them. It is important to understand why this occurs and use this information to increase the use of evidence-based practices. Toward this goal, 2 proof-of-construct studies demonstrate the theoretical and methodological advantages of measuring behavioral intentions to use specific practices.
Sleep disturbances are associated with specific sensory sensitivities in children with autism.Sensory abnormalities and sleep disturbances are highly prevalent in children with autism, but the potential relationship between these two domains has rarely been explored. Understanding such relationships is important for identifying children with autism who exhibit more homogeneous symptoms.
Do Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder Benefit from Structural Alignment When Constructing Categories?Individuals with ASD seem to construct categories via processes different to typically developing individuals. We examined whether individuals with ASD engage in structural alignment of exemplars when constructing categories. We taught children with ASD and typically developing children novel nouns for either single or multiple exemplars, and then examined their extensions of the learned nouns to objects that were either a perceptual or conceptual match to the original exemplar(s). Results indicated that, unlike typically developing participants, those with ASD gained no benefit from seeing multiple exemplars of the category and, thus, did not appear to engage in structural alignment in their formation of categories. However, they demonstrated superior performance compared to typically developing children when presented with a single exemplar.
Sulforaphane Protects against Brain Diseases: Roles of Cytoprotective Enzymes.Sulforaphane (SFN) is a kind of isothiocyanate derived from broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables. Because of its roles of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-tumor through multiple targets and various mechanisms, SFN has drawn broad attention of the researchers. One of the most important target of SFN is nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2), wildly known for its ability to regulate the expression of a series of cytoprotective enzymes with antioxidative, prosurvival, and detoxification effects. Multiple researches have shown that SFN protects against central nervous system diseases through Nrf2pathway. In this article, we list SFN contents in common cruciferous vegetables, and summarize recent advances in the protective effects of SFN against acute brain injuries and neurodegenerative diseases through activating Nrf2 signaling pathway.
Introduction to the Special Issue: Interventions to Reduce Challenging Behavior Among Individuals With Autism Spectrum Disorder.The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is on the rise. In addition to the social communication skill deficits and restrictive repetitive behaviors and interests, many individuals with ASD engage in challenging behavior. Challenging behavior is associated with a multitude of negative outcomes. Challenging behavior may cause harm to the individual with ASD as well as limit opportunities for educational, vocational, and social participation and development. In addition, caregivers experience high stress and low quality of mental health. As a result, challenging behavior warrants intervention that is specifically tailored to the unique characteristics of individuals with ASD. The purpose of this Special Issue is to showcase recent research in the treatment of challenging behavior for individuals with ASD. This two-part Special Issue contains 12 studies that range from systematic and quality reviews of the intervention literature, to innovative treatment approaches, to studies that develop and evaluate treatments for restrictive and repetitive behaviors and interests.
Using Pattern Classification to Identify Brain Imaging Markers in Autism Spectrum Disorder.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by deficits in social interaction and communication, as well as repetitive and restrictive behaviours. The etiological and phenotypic complexity of ASD has so far hindered the development of clinically useful biomarkers for the condition. Neuroimaging studies have been valuable in establishing a biological basis for ASD. Increasingly, neuroimaging has been combined with 'machine learning'-based pattern classification methods to make individual diagnostic predictions. Moving forward, the hope is that these techniques may not only facilitate the diagnostic process but may also aid in fractionating the ASD phenotype into more biologically homogeneous sub-groups, with defined pathophysiology, predictable outcomes and/or responses to targeted treatments and/or interventions. This review chapter will first introduce 'machine learning' and pattern recognition methods in general, with a focus on their application to diagnostic classification. It will highlight why such approaches to biomarker discovery may have advantages over more conventional analytical methods. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of atypical brain structure, function and connectivity in ASD will be briefly reviewed before we describe how pattern recognition has been applied to generate predictive models for ASD. Last, we will discuss some limitations and pitfalls of pattern recognition analyses in ASD and consider how the field can advance beyond the prediction of binary outcomes.
Gaussian process uncertainty in age estimation as a measure of brain abnormality.Multivariate regression models for age estimation are a powerful tool for assessing abnormal brain morphology associated to neuropathology. Age prediction models are built on cohorts of healthy subjects and are built to reflect normal aging patterns. The application of these multivariate models to diseased subjects usually results in high prediction errors, under the hypothesis that neuropathology presents a similar degenerative pattern as that of accelerated aging. In this work, we propose an alternative to the idea that pathology follows a similar trajectory than normal aging. Instead, we propose the use of metrics which measure deviations from the mean aging trajectory. We propose to measure these deviations using two different metrics: uncertainty in a Gaussian process regression model and a newly proposed age weighted uncertainty measure. Consequently, our approach assumes that pathologic brain patterns are different to those of normal aging. We present results for subjects with autism, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease to highlight the versatility of the approach to different diseases and age ranges. We evaluate volume, thickness, and VBM features for quantifying brain morphology. Our evaluations are performed on a large number of images obtained from a variety of publicly available neuroimaging databases. Across all features, our uncertainty based measurements yield a better separation between diseased subjects and healthy individuals than the prediction error. Finally, we illustrate differences in the disease pattern to normal aging, supporting the application of uncertainty as a measure of neuropathology.
Brief Report: Service Use and Associated Expenditures Among Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder Transitioning to Adulthood.This study compared Medicaid service utilization and expenditures among adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to adolescents with intellectual disability (ID) as they aged into adulthood. Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) data was used to identify a national cohort. Winsorization was utilized to control for expenditure outliers. A greater proportion of adolescents with ASD utilized most services. Decreases in the use of key services, including psychiatric outpatient services, were observed for both groups. Changes in medical services, such as increases in inpatient and long term care services, among the ASD cohort suggest medical needs of adolescents with ASD change as they age. Information remains lacking on changing ASD symptom presentation during the transition to adolescence.
Sensory Prediction Errors Are Less Modulated by Global Context in Autism Spectrum Disorder.Recent predictive coding accounts of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) suggest that a key deficit in ASD concerns the inflexibility in modulating local prediction errors as a function of global top-down expectations. As a direct test of this central hypothesis, we used electroencephalography to investigate whether local prediction error processing was less modulated by global context (i.e., global stimulus frequency) in ASD.
Altered structural brain connectivity involving the dorsal and ventral language pathways in 16p11.2 deletion syndrome.Copy number variants at the chromosomal locus 16p11.2 contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders, epilepsy, schizophrenia, and language and articulation disorders. Here, we provide detailed findings on the disrupted structural brain connectivity in 16p11.2 deletion syndrome (patients: N = 21, age range: 8-16 years; typically developing (TD) controls: 18, 9-16 years) using structural and diffusion MRI. We performed global short-, middle-, long-range, and interhemispheric connectivity analysis in the whole brain using gyral topology-based cortical parcellation. Using region of interest analysis, we studied bilateral dorsal (3 segments of arcuate fasciculus (AF)) and ventral (inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), uncinate fasciculus (UF)) language pathways. Our results showed significantly increased axial (AD) and radial (RD) diffusivities in bilateral anterior AF, decreased volume for left long AF, increased mean diffusivity (MD) and RD for right long AF, and increased AD for bilateral UF in the 16p11.2 deletion group in the absence of significant abnormalities in the whole-brain gyral and interhemispheric connectivity. The selective involvement of the language networks may aid in understanding effects of altered white matter connectivity on neurodevelopmental outcomes in 16p11.2 deletion.
Fluctuations in clinical symptoms with changes in serum 25(OH) vitamin D levels in autistic children: Three cases report.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder caused by complicated interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Clinical trials, including case reports, case-control studies, and a double-blinded randomized clinical study, have suggested that high-dose vitamin D3 regimens may ameliorate the core symptoms of ASD. Vitamin D3 supplementation was effective in about three-quarters of children with ASD. To further investigate the relationship between vitamin D and ASD symptoms in vitamin D-responsive autistic children, changes in symptoms were assessed in three children with ASD who were given vitamin D3 supplementation followed by a long interruption. The core symptoms of ASD were remarkably improved during the vitamin D3 supplementation period when serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)]D levels reached over 40.0 ng/mL. However, symptoms reappeared after the supplementation was stopped, when serum 25(OH)D levels fell below 30.0 ng/mL but were again improved with re-administration of vitamin D3 after the interruption, when serum 25(OH)D levels exceeded 40.0 ng/mL. Overall, these results showed that the core symptoms of ASD fluctuated in severity with changes in serum 25(OH)D levels in children, indicating that maintaining a responsive 25(OH)D level is important for treating ASD. Maintaining a serum 25(OH)D level between 40.0 and 100.0 ng/ml may be optimal for producing therapeutic effects in vitamin D-responsive individuals with ASD.
Selective Pragmatic Impairment in Autism Spectrum Disorder: Indirect Requests Versus Irony.Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is often described as being characterised by a uniform pragmatic impairment. However, recent evidence suggests that some areas of pragmatic functioning are preserved. This study seeks to determine to which extent context-based derivation of non-linguistically encoded meaning is functional in ASD. We compare the performance of 24 adults with ASD, and matched neuro-typical adults in two act-out pragmatic tasks. The first task examines generation of indirect request interpretations, and the second the comprehension of irony. Intact contextual comprehension of indirect requests contrasts with marked difficulties in understanding irony. These results suggest that preserved pragmatics in ASD is limited to egocentric processing of context, which does not rely on assumptions about the speaker's mental states.
The prevalence of autistic traits in a homeless population.Anecdotal evidence suggests that autistic people experience an elevated risk of homelessness, but systematic empirical research on this topic is lacking. As a step towards filling this gap in knowledge, we conducted a preliminary investigation of the prevalence of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.) autism symptoms in a group of long-term homeless people. The entire caseload ( N = 106) of a UK homeless outreach team was screened (excluding individuals born outside of the United Kingdom or Republic of Ireland) using an in-depth, semi-structured interview with keyworkers, based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.) diagnostic criteria. This showed adequate inter-rater reliability, as well as evidence of criterion and construct validity. Of the sample, 13 people (12.3%, 95% confidence interval (7.0, 20.4)) screened positive, meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.) autism criteria by keyworker report. A further nine people (8.5%, 95% confidence interval (4.5, 15.3)) were 'marginal', having autistic traits that were not quite sufficient to meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.) criteria. Those with elevated autistic traits, compared to those without, tended to be more socially isolated and less likely to use substances. This study has provided initial evidence that autistic traits are over-represented among homeless people and that autistic homeless people may show a distinct pattern of characteristics and needs. Further investigation is required to build upon these provisional findings.
Implementing systems-based innovations to improve access to early screening, diagnosis, and treatment services for children with autism spectrum disorder: An Autism Spectrum Disorder Pediatric, Early Detection, Engagement, and Services network study.In 2013, the National Institute of Mental Health funded five trials of unique, multicomponent, systems-based innovations designed to improve access to early screening, diagnosis, and treatment of autism spectrum disorder-collectively known as the Autism Spectrum Disorder Pediatric, Early Detection, Engagement, and Services Network. As part of an ongoing effort to pool data and learn from shared experience, we collected information across all studies about innovation components and implementation strategies. First, each study group completed standardized checklists based on the Template for Intervention Description and Replication and the Expert Recommendation for Implementing Change. Then, we interviewed principal and co-investigators of each study (n = 9) to further explore innovation components and assess barriers and facilitators to implementation. Innovation strategies were diverse (five different autism spectrum disorder screeners were used, 40% included early intervention trainings, 60% involved new technology). Common implementation strategies included developing stakeholder relationships and provider trainings. Barriers included inefficient systems of care, difficulty engaging families in the innovations, provider attitudes, and organizational culture (e.g. difficulty changing clinic processes). These findings suggest that-despite diverse settings and a variety of innovation content-common facilitators and challenges exist in implementing innovations to enhance access to early autism spectrum disorder screening, diagnosis, and treatment.
Cost of assessing a child for possible autism spectrum disorder? An observational study of current practice in child development centres in the UK.UK guidelines recommend that diagnosis of autism in children requires assessment by a multidisciplinary team. With growing numbers of referrals for assessment, diagnostic services have been under increasing pressure to meet the level of need. This study aimed to explore the number of hours of professional time required to complete such an assessment based on current practice in secondary care child development centres across the UK, and from this we calculate the cost of assessment.
Neuroimaging results, short-term assessment of psychomotor development and the risk of autism spectrum disorder in extremely premature infants (≤28 GA) - a prospective cohort study (preliminary report).Infants ≤28 GA are at particular risk of psychomotor and neurological developmental disorder. They also remain at a higher risk of developing autism spectrum disorder (ASD), characterized by persistent deficits in communication/social interactions and restricted, repetitive behaviors, activities and interests. Monitoring their development by a team of specialists (a neurologist, psychologist, psychiatrist) allows us to make an early diagnosis and to implement appropriate therapy. Neuroimaging studies during the neonatal period may be helpful in clarifying diagnosis and prognosis. Objective: The aim of the study was to search for the interrelation between the results of neuroimaging and the neurological, psychological and psychiatric evaluation at the age of 2.
Therapeutic use of carbohydrate-restricted diets in an autistic child; a case report of clinical and 18FDG PET findings.The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, adequate-protein, and low-carbohydrate diet that has been used successfully in the treatment of refractory epilepsies for almost 100 years. There has been accumulating evidence to show that the KD may provide a therapeutic benefit in autism spectrum disorders, albeit by a yet-unknown mechanism. We report a case of a 6-year-old patient with high-functioning autism and subclinical epileptic discharges who responded poorly to several behavioural and psychopharmacological treatments. The patient was subsequently placed on the KD due to significant glucose hypometabolism in the brain as revealed by an 18FDG PET. As soon as one month after starting the KD, the patient's behavior and intellect improved (in regard to hyperactivity, attention span, abnormal reactions to visual and auditory stimuli, usage of objects, adaptability to changes, communication skills, fear, anxiety, and emotional reactions); these improvements continued until the end of the observation period at 16 months on the KD. The 18FDG PET, measured at 12 months on the KD, revealed that 18F-FDG uptake decreased markedly and diffusely in the whole cerebral cortex with a relatively low reduction in basal ganglia in comparison to the pre-KD assessment. It warrants further investigation if the 18FDG PET imaging could serve as a biomarker in identifying individuals with autism who might benefit from the KD due to underlying abnormalities related to glucose hypometabolism.
A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Cross-Over Pilot Study of Riluzole for Drug-Refractory Irritability in Autism Spectrum Disorder.Riluzole is a glutamatergic modulator of particular interest in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In this 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover pilot study we evaluated the safety and tolerability of 5-week of adjunctive riluzole treatment (vs. 5-week of placebo, with 2-week washout period) targeting ASD-associated drug-refractory irritability in eight individuals age 12-25 years. All participants tolerated riluzole 200 mg per day, however there were no statistically significant findings for the overall treatment effect, the treatment effect by week within period of the study, or a cross-over effect across the periods of the study on the Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale or the Aberrant Behavior Checklist Irritability subscale. The results of this trial indicate that 5-week of riluzole treatment was well tolerated, but had no significant effect on the target symptoms.

Brief Report: Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Comprehensive Survey of Randomized Controlled Trials.We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to provide an overview of evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of therapeutic interventions for autism spectrum disorders. From the final survey (529 RCTs), the mean size was 49 participants (standard deviation 50, range 1-479, median 36, mode 40), with a sharp increase in the number of RCTs from 2008. The most frequently evaluated intervention was antipsychotic treatment (n = 44, 3006 participants). The journal with the most RCTs was the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (N = 104). Most trials were small in size, emphasising the need for research groups to collaborate to generate higher quality data with greater applicability to clinical practice.
The Feeling of Me Feeling for You: Interoception, Alexithymia and Empathy in Autism.Following recent evidence for a link between interoception, emotion and empathy, we investigated relationships between these factors in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). 26 adults with ASD and 26 healthy participants completed tasks measuring interoception, alexithymia and empathy. ASD participants with alexithymia demonstrated lower cognitive and affective empathy than ASD participants without alexithymia. ASD participants showed reduced interoceptive sensitivity (IS), and also reduced interoceptive awareness (IA). IA was correlated with empathy and alexithymia, but IS was related to neither. Alexithymia fulfilled a mediating role between IA and empathy. Our findings are suggestive of an alexithymic subgroup in ASD, with distinct interoceptive processing abilities, and have implications for diagnosis and interventions.
Meta-analysis of Tablet-Mediated Interventions for Teaching Academic Skills to Individuals with Autism.Portable touch-screen devices have been the focus of a notable amount of intervention research involving individuals with autism. Additionally, popular media has widely circulated claims that such devices and academic software applications offer tremendous educational benefits. A systematic search identified 19 studies that targeted academic skills for individuals with autism. Most studies used the device's built-in video recording or camera function to create customized teaching materials, rather than commercially-available applications. Analysis of potential moderating variables indicated that participants' age and functioning level did not influence outcomes. However, participant operation of the device, as opposed to operation by an instructor, produced significantly larger effect size estimates. Results are discussed in terms of recommendations for practitioners and future research.
Development of fine motor skills is associated with expressive language outcomes in infants at high and low risk for autism spectrum disorder.A growing body of research suggests that fine motor abilities are associated with skills in a variety of domains in both typical and atypical development. In this study, we investigated developmental trajectories of fine motor skills between 6 and 24 months in relation to expressive language outcomes at 36 months in infants at high and low familial risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
Study of the Effect of Bisphenol A on Oxidative Stress in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders.The role of bisphenol A (BPA) in autism was investigated in 49 children (mean age = 5.950 ± 1.911 years) with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and 40 comparable age and sex matched children used as controls (mean age = 5.333 ± 2.279 years). In addition, 8-Hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) was also studied as a biomarker of oxidative stress in the same set of two selected groups. The results showed that both BPA and 8-oxodG were significantly higher in children with autism than those of control children (
Operationalizing atypical gaze in toddlers with autism spectrum disorders: a cohesion-based approach.Multiple eye-tracking studies have highlighted the "atypical" nature of social attention in autism. However, it is unclear how "atypical" or "typical" should be quantified.
Higher Autistic Traits Among Criminals, But No Link to Psychopathy: Findings from a High-Security Prison in Portugal.The relationship between autism, criminality and psychopathy has gained increased attention in recent years, although research has focused on autism spectrum disorders, and not autistic traits. We measured autistic traits (with the Autism Spectrum Quotient) in a sample of 101 inmates from a high-security prison and compared them to a control group, using a logistic regression model that included age, education, psychopathology, psychopathy and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder as covariates. Prisoners had more autistic traits (OR 1.13, p = 0.002) due to higher scores in the communication (OR 1.23) and imagination (OR 1.30) domains. No correlations were found between autistic and psychopathic traits. Our study points to the presence of autistic traits as being independent risk factors for imprisonment, although not associated with psychopathy.
Psychophysiological measures of stress in caregivers of individuals with autism spectrum disorder: a systematic review.Parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often self-report heightened levels of stress and physical health problems. This paper reviewed studies assessing physiological measures of stress among parents of children with ASD.
Adults with Autism Tend to Undermine the Hidden Environmental Structure: Evidence from a Visual Associative Learning Task.The learning-style theory of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) (Qian, Lipkin, Frontiers in Human Neuroscience 5:77, 2011) states that ASD individuals differ from neurotypics in the way they learn and store information about the environment and its structure. ASD would rather adopt a lookup-table strategy (LUT: memorizing each experience), while neurotypics would favor an interpolation style (INT: extracting regularities to generalize). In a series of visual behavioral tasks, we tested this hypothesis in 20 neurotypical and 20 ASD adults. ASD participants had difficulties using the INT style when instructions were hidden but not when instructions were revealed. Rather than an inability to use rules, ASD would be characterized by a disinclination to generalize and infer such rules.
Resveratrol attenuates pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of JAK1-STAT3 in BTBR TAutism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by qualitative impairment in communication, social interaction, and repetitive stereotypic behavior. Resveratrol plays a role in several disorders such as neuroimmune, autoimmune, and allergic disorders. BTBR T
A de novo 921 Kb microdeletion at 11q13.1 including neurexin 2 in a boy with developmental delay, deficits in speech and language without autistic behaviors.Microdeletions at 11q13.1 are very rare. At present only two patients with 11q13.1 deletion involving neurexin 2 (NRXN2) have been reported. Both patients exhibited autistic features, which supported the role of NRXN2 in autism pathogenicity. It is currently unknown whether heterozygous deletion of NRXN2 is of high penetrance or if it is sufficient to result in autism behaviors. Here we reported a 2-year-9-month old boy with developmental delay, short stature, significant language delay and other congenital anomalies. In contrast to previously reported cases, the boy did not present with autistic behaviors and did not meet the clinical diagnosis of autism. A de novo 921 kb microdeletion at 11q13.1 was detected by chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA). Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) was also employed for our patient. The deletion was confirmed and no additional pathogenic variants were detected. We compared our patient's genomic information and clinical features with those of two previously reported individuals. Three patients shared similar deleted intervals and had similar clinical features except for autistic behaviors. This study suggested that NRXN2 gene had incomplete penetrance for autistic behavioral phenotype. The finding is of interest for genetic counseling and clinical management to patients with NRXN2 defects.
No effect of prenatal vitamin D deficiency on autism-relevant behaviours in multiple inbred strains of mice.Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) is a group of neurodevelopmental disorders commonly characterised by verbal and non-verbal communication deficits, impaired social interaction and repetitive, stereotypic behaviours. The aetiology of ASD is most likely a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Epidemiological evidence suggests that prenatal vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased incidence of ASD. The overall aim of this study was to investigate prenatal vitamin D deficiency on ASD-related behavioural phenotypes in multiple inbred strains of mice. We included two commonly used inbred mouse strains (C57BL/6J and BALB/c) as well as inbred BTBR mice, which show ASD-related behaviours, such as excessive self-grooming, hyperlocomotion, social interaction deficits and altered communication. We also studied the effect of prenatal vitamin D deficiency in a fourth strain; an F1 cross of C57BL/6J x BTBR mice, which have a partial BTBR phenotype. To implement prenatal vitamin D deficiency, female mice were placed on vitamin D deplete diets for ten weeks, including mating and gestation, until littering, when all dams were switched to the control diet. Behavioural symptoms related to ASD were measured, including isolation-induced ultrasonic vocalisations to measure communication, the three-chambered social interaction task to observe social interaction, the open field test to examine hyperlocomotion, assessment of grooming and rearing behaviour and finally the active place avoidance task to observe spatial learning and memory in response to a mild foot shock. Prenatal vitamin D deficiency had a negative impact on preference for social novelty in C57BL/6J mice, despite similar vocalisation phenotypes, and prenatal vitamin D-deficient F1 mice were found to be hypolocomotive in the open field test yet performed better on the active place avoidance task. Despite clear differences between strains, there were no other consistent significant main effects of maternal diet on the behaviour of the offspring. Vitamin D deficiency has been implicated as a risk factor for ASD and these data show that there is greater variation between different inbred strains in ASD-related behaviour, suggesting that prenatal vitamin D deficiency is not sufficient to recapitulate an ASD phenotype in multiple inbred strains of mice.
Truncating Variants in NAA15 Are Associated with Variable Levels of Intellectual Disability, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and Congenital Anomalies.N-alpha-acetylation is a common co-translational protein modification that is essential for normal cell function in humans. We previously identified the genetic basis of an X-linked infantile lethal Mendelian disorder involving a c.109T>C (p.Ser37Pro) missense variant in NAA10, which encodes the catalytic subunit of the N-terminal acetyltransferase A (NatA) complex. The auxiliary subunit of the NatA complex, NAA15, is the dimeric binding partner for NAA10. Through a genotype-first approach with whole-exome or genome sequencing (WES/WGS) and targeted sequencing analysis, we identified and phenotypically characterized 38 individuals from 33 unrelated families with 25 different de novo or inherited, dominantly acting likely gene disrupting (LGD) variants in NAA15. Clinical features of affected individuals with LGD variants in NAA15 include variable levels of intellectual disability, delayed speech and motor milestones, and autism spectrum disorder. Additionally, mild craniofacial dysmorphology, congenital cardiac anomalies, and seizures are present in some subjects. RNA analysis in cell lines from two individuals showed degradation of the transcripts with LGD variants, probably as a result of nonsense-mediated decay. Functional assays in yeast confirmed a deleterious effect for two of the LGD variants in NAA15. Further supporting a mechanism of haploinsufficiency, individuals with copy-number variant (CNV) deletions involving NAA15 and surrounding genes can present with mild intellectual disability, mild dysmorphic features, motor delays, and decreased growth. We propose that defects in NatA-mediated N-terminal acetylation (NTA) lead to variable levels of neurodevelopmental disorders in humans, supporting the importance of the NatA complex in normal human development.
Polygenic risk for psychiatric disorders correlates with executive function in typical development.Executive functions are a diverse and critical suite of cognitive abilities that are often disrupted in individuals with psychiatric disorders. Despite their moderate to high heritability, little is known about the molecular genetic factors that contribute to variability in executive functions and how these factors may be related to those that predispose to psychiatric disorders. We examined the relationship between polygenic risk scores built from large genome-wide association studies of psychiatric disorders and executive functioning in typically developing children. In our discovery sample (N = 417), consistent with previous reports on general cognitive abilities, polygenic risk for autism spectrum disorder was associated with better performance on the Dimensional Change Card Sort test from the NIH Cognition Toolbox, with the largest effect in the youngest children. Polygenic risk for major depressive disorder was associated with poorer performance on the Flanker test in the same sample. This second association replicated for performance on the Penn Conditional Exclusion Test in an independent cohort (N = 3681). Our results suggest that the molecular genetic factors contributing to variability in executive function during typical development are at least partially overlapping with those associated with psychiatric disorders, although larger studies and further replication are needed.
RDoC-based categorization of amygdala functions and its implications in autism.Confusion endures as to the exact role of the amygdala in relation to autism. To help resolve this we turned to the NIMH's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) which provides a classification schema that identifies different categories of behaviors that can turn pathologic in mental health disorders, e.g. autism. While RDoC incorporates all the known neurobiological substrates for each domain, this review will focus primarily on the amygdala. We first consider the amygdala from an anatomical, historical, and developmental perspective. Next, we examine the different domains and constructs of RDoC that the amygdala is involved in: Negative Valence Systems, Positive Valence Systems, Cognitive Systems, Social Processes, and Arousal and Regulatory Systems. Then the evidence for a dysfunctional amygdala in autism is presented with a focus on alterations in development, prenatal valproic acid exposure as a model for ASD, and changes in the oxytocin system therein. Finally, a synthesis of RDoC, the amygdala, and autism is offered, emphasizing the task of disambiguation and suggestions for future research.
Ethopathology and Civilization Diseases: Niko and Elisabeth Tinbergen on Autism.The idea that some diseases result from a poor fit between modern life and our biological make-up is part of the long history of what historian of medicine Charles Rosenberg has called the "progress-and-pathology narrative." This article examines a key episode in that history: 1973 Nobel laureate Niko Tinbergen's use of an evolutionary framework to identify autism as a pathogenic effect of progress. Influenced by British psychiatrist John Bowlby's work, Tinbergen and his wife Elisabeth saw autistic children as victims of environmental stress caused mainly by mothers' failure to bond with their children and to protect them from conflicting situations. However, the author argues that their position was not "environmental." For them, autism was due to a failure of socialization but the mechanisms that explain that failure were established by biological evolution. Situating their views within the context of Niko's concern about the derailment of biological evolution by cultural evolution, this article shows that their ideas are of special significance for understanding the persistence of the view that civilization poses a risk to human health.
Neural Mechanisms of Qigong Sensory Training Massage for Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Feasibility Study.Despite the enormous prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), its global impact has yet to be realized. Millions of families worldwide need effective treatments to help them get through everyday challenges like eating, sleeping, digestion, and social interaction. Qigong Sensory Training (QST) is a nonverbal, parent-delivered intervention recently shown to be effective at reducing these everyday challenges in children with ASD. This study tested the feasibility of a protocol for investigating QST's neural mechanism.
Similarities and differences between infantile and early childhood onset vanishing white matter disease.Vanishing white matter disease (VWM) is one of the most prevalent inherited leukoencephalopathies in childhood. Infantile VWM is more severe but less understood than the classic early childhood type. We performed a follow-up study on 14 infantile and 26 childhood patients to delineate the natural history and neuroimaging features of VWM. Infantile and childhood patients shared similarities in the incidence of epileptic seizure (35.7 vs. 38.5%) and episodic aggravation (92.9 vs. 84.6%). Developmental delay before disease onset was more common in infantile patients. Motor disability was earlier and more severe in infantile VWM. In survivors with disease durations of 1-3 years, the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) was classified as IV-V in 66.7% of infantile and only 29.4% of childhood patients. Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis indicated that the 5-year survival rates were 21.6 and 91.3% in infantile and childhood VWM, respectively. In terms of MRI, infantile patients showed more extensive involvement and earlier rarefaction, with more common involvement of subcortical white matter, internal capsule, brain stem and dentate nuclei of the cerebellum. Restricted diffusion was more diffuse or extensive in infantile patients. In addition, four novel mutations were identified. In conclusion, we identified some similarities and differences in the natural history and neuroimaging features between infantile and early childhood VWM.
Dynamics and structural stability effects of germline PTEN mutations associated with cancer versus autism phenotypes.Individuals with germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), irrespective of clinical presentation, are diagnosed with PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS). PHTS confers a high risk of breast, thyroid, and other cancers or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with macrocephaly. It remains unclear why mutations in one gene can lead to seemingly disparate phenotypes. Thus, we sought to identify differences in ASD vs. cancer-associated germline PTEN missense mutations by investigating putative structural effects induced by each mutation. We utilized a theoretical computational approach combining in silico structural analysis and molecular dynamics (MD) to interrogate 17 selected mutations from our patient population: six mutations were observed in patients with ASD (only), six mutations in patients with PHTS-associated cancer (only), four mutations shared across both phenotypes, and one mutation with both ASD and cancer. We demonstrate structural stability changes where all six cancer-associated mutations showed a global decrease in structural stability and increased dynamics across the domain interface with a proclivity to unfold, mediating a closed (inactive) active site. In contrast, five of the six ASD-associated mutations showed localized destabilization that contribute to the partial opening of the active site. Our results lend insight into distinctive structural effects of germline PTEN mutations associated with PTEN-ASD vs. those associated with PTEN-cancer, potentially aiding in identification of the shared and separate molecular features that contribute to autism or cancer, thus, providing a deeper understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships for germline PTEN mutations.
A direct regulatory link between microRNA-137 and SHANK2: implications for neuropsychiatric disorders.Mutations in the SHANK genes, which encode postsynaptic scaffolding proteins, have been linked to a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders. The SHANK genes and the schizophrenia-associated microRNA-137 show convergence on several levels, as they are both expressed at the synapse, influence neuronal development, and have a strong link to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders like intellectual disability, autism, and schizophrenia. This compiled evidence raised the question if the SHANKs might be targets of miR-137.
Working with children with autism and their families: pediatric hospital social worker perceptions of family needs and the role of social work.Social workers with knowledge of autism can be valuable contributors to client- and family-centered healthcare services. This study utilized a qualitative design to explore pediatric hospital social workers' experiences and perceptions when working with children and youth with autism and their families. Interviews with 14 social workers in a Canadian urban pediatric hospital highlighted perceptions of the needs of families of children with autism in the hospital and challenges and benefits related to the role of social work with these families. Results suggest that pediatric social workers may benefit from opportunities to develop autism-relevant knowledge and skills.
Leo Kanner and autism: a 75-year perspective.In 1943, Leo Kanner published the first systematic description of early infantile autism. He concluded that this was a neurodevelopmental disorder and that 'these children have come into the world with an innate inability to form the usual, biologically provided contact with people'. Moreover, his astute descriptions of parental behavior in his first publications were prescient and underlie later recognition of the importance of genetics. Our understanding has grown over the ensuing years with revisions in diagnostic classification, recognition of the broader autism phenotype in families, appreciation of the importance of developmental models, advances in genetic methodology, better understanding of the relationship to intellectual deficits, recognition of syndromic autism in neurogenetic sydromes, advances in neuroimaging, and advances in animal models, both mutant mouse models and transgenic non human primate models. Kanner recognized diagnostic heterogeneity and opined that the children had not read those diagnostic manuals and did not easily fall into clear cut categories. Such heterogeneity continues to confound our diagnostic efforts. Always an advocate for children, when reviewing the DSM III criteria in 1980, Kanner emphasized that no matter how well developed our criteria each child must be treated as a unique person.
Short Play and Communication Evaluation: Teachers' assessment of core social communication and play skills with young children with autism.Children with autism spectrum disorder experience delays in the development of nonverbal social communication gestures to request and to share (joint attention) as well as play skills such that intervention is required. Although such tools exist in research settings, community stakeholders also require access to brief, simple, and reliable tools to assess students' skills and set appropriate intervention targets. This study includes a sequence of two trials to examine implementation outcomes including adoption, fidelity, and feasibility of The Short Play and Communication Evaluation by educational professionals who work with preschoolers and toddlers with autism spectrum disorder in low-resource community classrooms. Findings demonstrate that classroom staff can deliver the Short Play and Communication Evaluation with high fidelity, collect live data, and set appropriate social communication and play skill targets for use in intervention. Furthermore, study 2 demonstrates that modifications to the study protocol resolved differences in children's skill profile obtained from the established research measures.
Metacognitive monitoring and the hypercorrection effect in autism and the general population: Relation to autism(-like) traits and mindreading.Among neurotypical adults, errors made with high confidence (i.e. errors a person strongly believed they would not make) are corrected more reliably than errors made with low confidence. This 'hypercorrection effect' is thought to result from enhanced attention to information that reflects a 'metacognitive mismatch' between one's beliefs and reality. In Experiment 1, we employed a standard measure of this effect. Participants answered general knowledge questions and provided confidence judgements about how likely each answer was to be correct, after which feedback was given. Finally, participants were retested on all questions answered incorrectly during the initial phase. Mindreading ability and autism spectrum disorder-like traits were measured. We found that a representative sample of ( n = 83) neurotypical participants made accurate confidence judgements (reflecting good metacognition) and showed the hypercorrection effect. Mindreading ability was associated with autism spectrum disorder-like traits and metacognition. However, the hypercorrection effect was non-significantly associated with mindreading or autism spectrum disorder-like traits. In Experiment 2, 11 children with autism spectrum disorder and 11 matched comparison participants completed the hypercorrection task. Although autism spectrum disorder children showed significantly diminished metacognitive ability, they showed an undiminished hypercorrection effect. The evidence in favour of an undiminished hypercorrection effect (null result) was moderate, according to Bayesian analysis (Bayes factor = 0.21).
Effects of SYN1A new Q555X mutation on the SYN1 gene was recently found in several members of a family segregating dyslexia, epilepsy, and autism spectrum disorder. To describe the effects of this mutation on cortical gray matter microstructure, we performed a surface-based group study using novel diffusion and quantitative multiparametric imaging on 13 SYN1
The development of autistic social traits across childhood and adolescence in males and females.Autism is a dimensional condition, representing the extreme end of a continuum of social competence that extends throughout the general population. Currently, little is known about how autistic social traits (ASTs), measured across the full spectrum of severity, develop during childhood and adolescence, including whether there are developmental differences between boys and girls. Therefore, we sought to chart the trajectories of ASTs in the general population across childhood and adolescence, with a focus on gender differences.
Prenatal and early-life diesel exhaust exposure causes autism-like behavioral changes in mice.Escalating prevalence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in recent decades has triggered increasing efforts in understanding roles played by environmental risk factors as a way to address this widespread public health concern. Several epidemiological studies show associations between developmental exposure to traffic-related air pollution and increased ASD risk. In rodent models, a limited number of studies have shown that developmental exposure to ambient ultrafine particulates or diesel exhaust (DE) can result in behavioral phenotypes consistent with mild ASD. We performed a series of experiments to determine whether developmental DE exposure induces ASD-related behaviors in mice.
Psychopharmacotherapy of Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder in Children with Comorbid Conditions.One or more comorbidities occur in up to 80% of children with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder. Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder is also over-represented in several special populations. Pharmacotherapy can be challenging in these individuals with other conditions due to a suboptimal therapeutic response and an increased likelihood of adverse reactions. This article reviews the evidence supporting the psychopharmacologic management attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder when it occurs in individuals with common comorbidities.
A Comparison of Safety and Efficacy of Dexmedetomidine and Propofol in Children with Autism and Autism Spectrum Disorders Undergoing Magnetic Resonance Imaging.Children with autism and autism spectrum disorders have a high incidence of neurologic comorbidities. Consequently, evaluation with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is deemed necessary. Sedating these patients poses several challenges. This retrospective study compared the efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine to propofol in sedating autistic patients undergoing MRI. There were 56 patients in the dexmedetomidine group and 49 in the propofol group. All of the patients successfully completed the procedure. Recovery and discharge times were significantly lower in the propofol group, while the dexmedetomidine group maintained more stable hemodynamics. Both propofol and dexmedetomidine proved to be adequate and safe medications in the sedation of autistic children undergoing MRI.
Two novel cases expanding the phenotype of SETD2-related overgrowth syndrome.The SETD2-related overgrowth syndrome is also called "Luscan-Lumish syndrome" (OMIM 616831) with the clinical characteristics of intellectual disability, speech delay, macrocephaly, facial dysmorphism, and autism spectrum disorders. We report on two novel patients a 4.5-year-old boy and a 23-year-old female adolescent with a speech and language developmental delay, autism spectrum disorder and macrocephaly, who were both diagnosed with SETD2-related overgrowth syndrome due to de novo frameshift mutations in the SETD2 gene. Features not previously described which were present in either one of our patients were nasal polyps, a large tongue with creases, a high pain threshold, constipation, and undescended testicles. These features may be related to the syndrome and may need special attention in future patients. Additionally, prevention of obesity should be an important point of attention for patients diagnosed with a SETD2-related overgrowth syndrome.
2016 Children's Tumor Foundation conference on neurofibromatosis type 1, neurofibromatosis type 2, and schwannomatosis.Organized and hosted by the Children's Tumor Foundation (CTF), the Neurofibromatosis (NF) conference is the premier annual gathering for clinicians and researchers interested in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), and schwannomatosis (SWN). The 2016 edition constituted a blend of clinical and basic aspects of NF research that helped in clarifying different advances in the field. The incorporation of next generation sequencing is changing the way genetic diagnostics is performed for NF and related disorders, providing solutions to problems like genetic heterogeneity, overlapping clinical manifestations, or the presence of mosaicism. The transformation from plexiform neurofibroma (PNF) to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is being clarified, along with new management and treatments for benign and premalignant tumors. Promising new cellular and in vivo models for understanding the musculoskeletal abnormalities in NF1, the development of NF2 or SWN associated schwannomas, and clarifying the cells that give rise to NF1-associated optic pathway glioma were presented. The interaction of neurofibromin and SPRED1 was described comprehensively, providing functional insight that will help in the interpretation of pathogenicity of certain missense variants identified in NF1 and Legius syndrome patients. Novel promising imaging techniques are being developed, as well as new integrative and holistic management models for patients that take into account psychological, social, and biological factors. Importantly, new therapeutic approaches for schwannomas, meningiomas, ependymomas, PNF, and MPNST are being pursued. This report highlights the major advances that were presented at the 2016 CTF NF conference.
Brain Responses Underlying Anthropomorphism, Agency, and Social Attribution in Autism Spectrum Disorder.Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to attribute mental states to oneself and others, is frequently impaired in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and may result from altered activation of social brain regions. Conversely, Typically Developing (TD) individuals overextend ToM and show a strong tendency to anthropomorphize and interpret biological motion in the environment. Less is known about how the degree of anthropomorphism influences intentional attribution and engagement of the social brain in ASD.
Co-occurring psychiatric conditions in autism spectrum disorder.Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at increased risk for experiencing one or more co-occurring psychiatric conditions. When present, these conditions are associated with additional impairment and distress. It is therefore crucial that clinicians and researchers adequately understand and address these challenges. However, due to symptom overlap, diagnostic overshadowing, and ambiguous symptom presentation in ASD, the assessment of co-occurring conditions in ASD is complex and challenging. Likewise, individual difference factors, such as age, intellectual functioning, and gender, may influence the presentation of co-occurring symptoms. Relatedly, a transdiagnostic framework may offer utility in assessing and treating co-occurring conditions. However, with the exception of anxiety disorders, treatment research for co-occurring psychiatric conditions in ASD is relatively limited. Therefore, the present paper aims to summarize and review available research on the most common co-occurring psychiatric disorders in ASD, with a focus on estimated population-based prevalence rates, diagnostic challenges, the influence of individual differences, and assessment guidelines. The utility of a transdiagnostic framework for conceptualizing co-occurring disorders in ASD is discussed, and the state of treatment research for co-occurring disorders is summarized. This study concludes with a summary of the extant literature, as well as recommendations for future research.
Why is vitamin B6 effective in alleviating the symptoms of autism?Many factors are reported to be involved in the complex pathophysiological processes of autism, suggesting that there is considerable variability in the manifestations of this disease. Several interventions are used to treat this disorder. Among them, vitamin B6 is widely used to treat the symptoms observed in autism. Vitamin B6 is beneficial for about half of autistic individuals in decreasing behavioral problems. However, until now, it remains unknown why vitamin B6 is effective for this disease. Although the exact pathogenesis is not defined, it is evident that certain neurotransmitter systems are impaired in the brains of autistic patients, causing the symptoms observed in the disease. In fact, impairment of many neurotransmitter systems has been reported, including GABA, serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenalin. Furthermore, vitamin B6 is important for the synthesis of many neurotransmitters, including GABA, serotonin, dopamine, noradrenalin, histamine, glycine, and d-serine, indicating that vitamin B6 supplementation may enhance many neurotransmitter systems. Thus, vitamin B6 supplementation can treat the impaired neurotransmitter systems in a given patient, even if the actual impaired neurotransmitter systems are not defined in that patient.
Designing a model to detect the brain connections abnormalities in children with autism using 3D-cellular neural networks.In neuropsychological disorders, the significant abnormalities in the brain connections in some regions are observed. This paper presents a novel model to demonstrate the connections between different regions in children with autism. The proposed model first conducts the wavelet decomposition of electroencephalography signals by wavelet transform then the features are extracted, such as relative energy and entropy. These features are fed to the 3D-cellular neural network model as inputs to indicate the brain connections. The results showed that there are significant differences and abnormalities in the left hemisphere, (p<0.05) at the electrodes AF3, F3, P7, T7 and O1 in alpha band, AF3, F7, T7 and O1 in beta band, T7 and P7 in gamma band for children with autism compared with the control children. Also, the evaluation of the obtained connections values between brain regions indicated that there are more abnormalities in the connectivity of frontal and parietal lobes and the relations of the neighboring regions in all three bands especially in gamma band for autistic children. Evaluation of the analysis demonstrated that alpha frequency band had the best distinction level of 96.6% based on the obtained values of the cellular neural network using support vector machine method.
Clinical associations of maternal thyroid function with foetal brain development: Epidemiological interpretation and overview of available evidence.Thyroid hormone is an important regulator of early brain development, particularly during early stages of gestation during which foetal thyroid hormone availability depends on the maternal transfer of thyroid hormones. There is a wide range of experimental studies showing that low maternal thyroid hormone availability is associated with suboptimal brain development parameters. While few clinical studies have shown that overt maternal hypothyroidism is associated with lower child IQ, the question whether more subclinical changes in maternal thyroid function could also lead to suboptimal foetal brain development. In this review, we put the latter studies in perspective and discuss their interpretation from an epidemiological and clinical perspective. Furthermore, we extend this discussion to also include future perspective and identify important knowledge gaps in the field.
A Comparison of Emotional-Behavioral Problems of Siblings at the Age Range of 3-9 Year Old Children with Autism and Down Syndrome.Children's emotional-behavioral problems will have a huge impact on their future. Such problems are more seen in the siblings of children with special needs. The present study aimed to compare emotional-behavioral problems in the healthy siblings of autistic children with the healthy siblings of children with Down syndrome in order to identify such children in Iran.
Parent-Teacher Agreement on Social Skills and Behavior Problems Among Ethnically Diverse Preschoolers with Autism Spectrum Disorder.Parents and teachers provide complimentary information in the assessment of preschoolers so it is important to understand parent-teacher agreement, especially for children with autism. Parents and teachers rated an ethnically diverse sample of preschoolers with autism (N = 257; 67% Latino) on the Devereux Early Childhood Assessment (LeBuffe and Naglieri in Devereux Early Childhood Assessment: User's guide, Kaplan Press, Lewisville, 1999). Correlations between parent and teacher ratings were moderate and significant for social skills (r = 0.20-0.37) but near zero for behavioral concerns. Parents rated children as having stronger social skills and fewer behavioral concerns than teachers, unlike prior research with typically developing preschoolers. Both informants rated White/other children more positively than minority children on several subscales, although agreement was similar across groups. Implications for practice are discussed.
Valproate: life-saving, life-changing.Antiepileptic medications, and valproate principally, are commonly prescribed teratogens. There is significant concern that we are not doing enough to educate clinicians and potential parents about the risks of valproate in pregnancy. There is clear advice from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the International League Against Epilepsy about the risks of valproate exposure
Cluster analysis reveals subclinical subgroups with shared autistic and schizotypal traits.Autism and schizophrenia spectrum research is typically based on coarse diagnostic classification, which overlooks individual variation within clinical groups. This method limits the identification of underlying cognitive, genetic and neural correlates of specific symptom dimensions. This study, therefore, aimed to identify homogenous subclinical subgroups of specific autistic and schizotypal traits dimensions, that may be utilised to establish more effective diagnostic and treatment practices. Latent profile analysis of subscale scores derived from an autism-schizotypy questionnaire, completed by 1678 subclinical adults aged 18-40 years (1250 females), identified a local optimum of eight population clusters: High, Moderate and Low Psychosocial Difficulties; High, Moderate and Low Autism-Schizotypy; High Psychosis-Proneness; and Moderate Schizotypy. These subgroups represent the convergent and discriminant dimensions of autism and schizotypy in the subclinical population, and highlight the importance of examining subgroups of specific symptom characteristics across these spectra in order to identify the underlying genetic and neural correlates that can be utilised to advance diagnostic and treatment practices.
2D:4D Ratio in Neurodevelopmental Disorders: A Twin Study.The second to fourth digit (2D:4D) ratio is of interest in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Studies on the relationship of this ratio with other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are lacking. Investigating the association between the ratio and NDDs in twins can provide insight into genetic and/or environmental factors driving the ratio. Hand images were collected in N = 238 twins with NDDs or typical development from 70 monozygotic and 49 dizygotic pairs to examine ratios and their associations to DSM-5 defined categorical NDDs, autistic traits, zygosity, and sex. There were small associations for males between the ratios and any NDD and ADHD diagnoses. Males had lower ratios than females. Future studies exploring the ratio alongside physical anomalies could provide etiological insight into NDDs.
Gender Identity in Autism: Sex Differences in Social Affiliation with Gender Groups.High rates of gender variance have been reported in autistic people, with higher variance in autistic females than males. The social component of gender identity may be affected, with autistic females experiencing lower identification with and feeling less positively about their gender groups than controls. We measured gender identification, gender self-esteem, and aspects of gender expression (masculinity and femininity) in autistic natal males and females, and controls (N = 486). We found that autistic people had lower gender identification and gender self-esteem than controls, and autistic natal females had lower gender identification than autistic natal males and natal female controls. In conclusion, autistic people, particularly natal females, had lower social identification with and more negative feelings about a gender group.
Psychosis in a Child with Atypical Autism: A Case Report and a Brief Review of the Association of Psychosis and Autism.Recent studies have shown that individuals with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at an increased risk of developing psychosis. Diagnosing psychosis in such individuals can be challenging when they present with symptoms at a young age. A careful history and thorough assessment are essential for proper diagnosis to avoid mislabeling certain behavioral problems encountered among children with ASD. We present the case of a 12-year-old child with atypical autism who developed psychotic symptoms that led to a diagnostic dilemma. Proper exploration of early childhood history, prompt treatment with an antipsychotic medication, and social skill training led to resolution of psychotic symptoms and improvement in disruptive symptoms of autism.
Pragmatic failure, mind style and characterisation in fiction about autism.This article presents an analysis of different types of pragmatic failure in the interactional behaviour of the 'autistic' protagonists of three recent novels. Three main types of pragmatic failure occur across all three novels: problems with informativeness and relevance in conversational contributions; problems with face management resulting in unintentional impolite behaviours; and problems with the interpretation of figurative language. These problems are salient and frequent enough to contribute to the projection of distinctive mind styles, and more generally to the characterisation of the protagonists as individuals with communication and socialisation difficulties that are likely to both reflect and reinforce general perceptions of autism-spectrum disorders. It is also argued that pragmatic failure contributes to the potential defamiliarisation of 'normal' communication, which is presented as being fraught with obscurity, ambiguity and insincerity.
Hans Asperger, National Socialism, and "race hygiene" in Nazi-era Vienna.Hans Asperger (1906-1980) first designated a group of children with distinct psychological characteristics as 'autistic psychopaths' in 1938, several years before Leo Kanner's famous 1943 paper on autism. In 1944, Asperger published a comprehensive study on the topic (submitted to Vienna University in 1942 as his postdoctoral thesis), which would only find international acknowledgement in the 1980s. From then on, the eponym 'Asperger's syndrome' increasingly gained currency in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the conceptualization of the condition. At the time, the fact that Asperger had spent pivotal years of his career in Nazi Vienna caused some controversy regarding his potential ties to National Socialism and its race hygiene policies. Documentary evidence was scarce, however, and over time a narrative of Asperger as an active opponent of National Socialism took hold. The main goal of this paper is to re-evaluate this narrative, which is based to a large extent on statements made by Asperger himself and on a small segment of his published work.
Prenatal mercury exposure and features of autism: a prospective population study.Mercury (Hg) has been suspected of causing autism in the past, especially a suspected link with vaccinations containing thiomersal, but a review of the literature shows that has been largely repudiated. Of more significant burden is the total quantity of Hg in the environment. Here, we have used the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) to test whether prenatal exposure from total maternal blood Hg in the first half of pregnancy is associated with the risk of autism or of extreme levels of autistic traits. This is the largest longitudinal study to date to have tested this hypothesis and the only one to have considered early pregnancy.
The Developmental Check-In: Development and initial testing of an autism screening tool targeting young children from underserved communities.Children with autism spectrum disorder from low-income, minority families or those with limited English proficiency are diagnosed at a later age, or not at all, compared with their more advantaged peers. The Developmental Check-In is a new tool that could potentially be used to screen for autism that uses pictures to illustrate target behaviors. It was developed to enhance early identification of autism spectrum disorder in low literacy groups. The Developmental Check-In was tested in a sample of 376 children between the ages of 24 and 60 months, from underserved communities. It showed good ability to discriminate autism spectrum disorder from non-autism spectrum disorder (area-under-the-curve = 0.75) across the full age range represented in the sample. Twenty-six of the 28 Developmental Check-In items predicted the presence of autism spectrum disorder. Findings suggest that this pictorial tool may reduce linguistic and health literacy demands when screening for autism among vulnerable populations.
Information, education, and health behaviors: Evidence from the MMR vaccine autism controversy.In the wake of strong, although later refuted, claims of a link between autism and the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, I examine whether fewer parents immunized or delayed vaccinations for their children and if there was a differential response by mother's education level. Using various controls and a differencing strategy that compares in MMR take-up with other vaccines, I find that the MMR-autism controversy led to a decline in the immediate years and that there were negative spillovers onto other vaccines. I also find evidence that more highly educated mothers responded more strongly to the controversy either by not immunizing their children altogether or, to a lesser degree, delaying vaccination. Moreover, the educational gap was greater in states where there was greater media attention devoted to the controversy. This is consistent with the health allocative efficiency hypothesis whereby part of the education gradient in health outcomes is due to more-educated individuals absorbing and responding to health information more quickly. However, unlike in the United Kingdom, where previous studies find that the gap was eliminated after the link was refuted, the evidence for the United States suggests that the educational gap persisted.
The Baseline Pattern and Age-related Developmental Metabolic Changes in the Brain of Children with Autism as Measured on Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Scan.[
An infantile alantoaxial dislocation with patent foramen ovale managed with titanium cabling and allogenic bone grafts.Atlantoaxial dislocation is a disorder that is characterized with loss of stability of the atlas and axis (C1-C2) with consequential loss of usual articulation. Although this condition is very common, no one has reported a case as young as our patients. We present a 7-month infant with bilateral paralysis of the lower limbs for four (4) months with no history of trauma. Computer tomographic (CT-scan) imaging revealed alantoaxial dislocation with severe cervical spinal cord compression. The odontoid process is displaced outwardly with no bone destruction. Doppler echocardiogram done revealed patent foramen ovale. Thorough physical examination as well as radiological evaluation revealed no feather malformations. Electrophysio - logical studies reveal normal compound muscle action potentials (CMAP) and sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) in all the limbs. Electromyography (EMG) also revealed normal nerves in the limbs and the trunk. We attained a stable fusion and anatomical reduction using a posterior titanium wire and an iliac bone graft harvested from his mother. This is the youngest patient reported in literature. Infantile alantoaxial dislocation should be managed at early stage to prevent long-term neurologic disorders.
Advances in the design of nanomaterial-based electrochemical affinity and enzymatic biosensors for metabolic biomarkers: A review.This review (with 340 refs) focuses on methods for specific and sensitive detection of metabolites for diagnostic purposes, with particular emphasis on electrochemical nanomaterial-based sensors. It also covers novel candidate metabolites as potential biomarkers for diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, autism spectrum disorder and hepatitis. Following an introduction into the field of metabolic biomarkers, a first major section classifies electrochemical biosensors according to the bioreceptor type (enzymatic, immuno, apta and peptide based sensors). A next section covers applications of nanomaterials in electrochemical biosensing (with subsections on the classification of nanomaterials, electrochemical approaches for signal generation and amplification using nanomaterials, and on nanomaterials as tags). A next large sections treats candidate metabolic biomarkers for diagnosis of diseases (in the context with metabolomics), with subsections on biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases, autism spectrum disorder and hepatitis. The Conclusion addresses current challenges and future perspectives. Graphical abstract This review focuses on the recent developments in electrochemical biosensors based on the use of nanomaterials for the detection of metabolic biomarkers. It covers the critical metabolites for some diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, autism spectrum disorder and hepatitis.
Overactivity, impulsivity and repetitive behaviour in males with fragile X syndrome: contrasting developmental trajectories in those with and without elevated autism symptoms.Hyperactivity and repetitive behaviour are characteristic features of fragile X syndrome (FXS). However, little is known about the influence of autism symptomatology on how these characteristics develop over time. We investigate the profiles and developmental trajectories of overactivity, impulsivity and repetitive behaviour, in males with FXS over three time points spanning 8 years.
The role of technology-mediated music-making in enhancing engagement and social communication in children with autism and intellectual disabilities.Very little research has explored the impact of interventions combining music and technology on children with a dual diagnosis of autism and intellectual disabilities (ID) incorporating the active involvement of school staff. Video recordings and group interviews were used to collect data in this study. Video recordings of five children with autism and ID were conducted as they engaged with a technology-mediated music-making intervention over a period of 5 weeks. Additionally, five group interviews with classroom staff were carried out. This study is the first to explore the impact of a technology-mediated music-making intervention on the engagement levels and social communication skills of children with autism and ID at school. Some positive outcomes, especially regarding social communication skills, are reported, which are of significant value to educational researchers and school staff.
Clinical Presentation of a Complex Neurodevelopmental Disorder Caused by Mutations in ADNP.In genome-wide screening studies for de novo mutations underlying autism and intellectual disability, mutations in the ADNP gene are consistently reported among the most frequent. ADNP mutations have been identified in children with autism spectrum disorder comorbid with intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, and deficits in multiple organ systems. However, a comprehensive clinical description of the Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome is lacking.
Meta-Analysis of the Association between GABA Receptor Polymorphisms and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).Previous studies have reported the association of GABA receptor subunits B3, A5, and G3 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in chromosome 15q11-q13 with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). However, the currently available results are inconsistent. This study aimed to investigate the association between ASD and the GABA receptor SNPs in chromosomal region 15q11-q13. The association was calculated by the overall odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). We used sensitivity analyses and the assessment of publication bias in our meta-analysis. Eight independent case-control studies involving 1408 cases and 2846 healthy controls were analyzed, namely, 8 studies for GABRB3 SNPs as well as 4 studies for GABRA5 and GABRG3 polymorphisms. The meta-analysis showed that GABRB3 polymorphisms in general are not significantly associated with autism [OR = 0.846 (95% CI): 0.595-1.201, I
Articulating Sensory Sensitivity: From Bodies with Autism to Autistic Bodies.Drawing on ethnographic evidence from several communities of autistic adults in the UK, I explore the crucial role of the body and the senses in the enactment of autistic subjectivities. Following their initiation into autism-related social groups, members begin using such concepts as triggers, overload, shutdown, and meltdown to refer to their bodily experiences of distress. They then face the task of investing these ambiguous concepts with meaning, through nurturing an increased awareness to their body's relationship with its material surrounding. This cultivation of sensitivity ultimately culminates in the transformation of their bodies into what might be termed autistic bodies.
Lack of Privileged Access to Awareness for Rewarding Social Scenes in Autism Spectrum Disorder.Reduced social motivation is hypothesised to underlie social behavioural symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The extent to which rewarding social stimuli are granted privileged access to awareness in ASD is currently unknown. We use continuous flash suppression to investigate whether individuals with and without ASD show privileged access to awareness for social over nonsocial rewarding scenes that are closely matched for stimulus features. Strong evidence for a privileged access to awareness for rewarding social over nonsocial scenes was observed in neurotypical adults. No such privileged access was seen in ASD individuals, and moderate support for the null model was noted. These results suggest that the purported deficits in social motivation in ASD may extend to early processing mechanisms.
Neonatal immune activation by lipopolysaccharide causes inadequate emotional responses to novel situations but no changes in anxiety or cognitive behavior in Wistar rats.Infection during the prenatal or neonatal stages of life is considered one of the major risk factors for the development of mental diseases such as schizophrenia or autism. However, the impacts of such an immune challenge on adult behavior are still not clear. In our study, we used a model of early postnatal immune activation by the application of bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to rat pups at a dose of 2 mg/kg from postnatal day (PD) 5 to PD 9. In adulthood, the rats were tested in a battery of tasks probing various aspects of behavior: spontaneous activity (open field test), social behavior (social interactions and female bedding exploration), anxiety (elevated plus maze), cognition (active place avoidance in Carousel) and emotional response (ultrasonic vocalization recording). Moreover, we tested sensitivity to acute challenge with MK-801, a psychotomimetic drug. Our results show that the application of LPS led to increased self-grooming in the female bedding exploration test and inadequate emotional reactions in Carousel maze displayed by ultrasonic vocalizations. However, it did not have serious consequences on exploration, locomotion, social behavior or cognition. Furthermore, exposition to MK-801 did not trigger social or cognitive deficits in the LPS-treated rats. We conclude that the emotional domain is the most sensitive to the changes induced by neonatal immune activation in rats, including a disrupted response to novel and stressful situations in early adulthood (similar to that observed in human patients suffering from schizophrenia or autism), while other aspects of tested behavior remain unaffected.
Role of inter-trial phase coherence in atypical auditory evoked potentials to speech and nonspeech stimuli in children with autism.This autism study investigated how inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) drives abnormalities in auditory evoked potential (AEP) responses for speech and nonspeech stimuli.
Social touch and human development.Social touch is a powerful force in human development, shaping social reward, attachment, cognitive, communication, and emotional regulation from infancy and throughout life. In this review, we consider the question of how social touch is defined from both bottom-up and top-down perspectives. In the former category, there is a clear role for the C-touch (CT) system, which constitutes a unique submodality that mediates affective touch and contrasts with discriminative touch. Top-down factors such as culture, personal relationships, setting, gender, and other contextual influences are also important in defining and interpreting social touch. The critical role of social touch throughout the lifespan is considered, with special attention to infancy and young childhood, a time during which social touch and its neural, behavioral, and physiological contingencies contribute to reinforcement-based learning and impact a variety of developmental trajectories. Finally, the role of social touch in an example of disordered development -autism spectrum disorder-is reviewed.
Differences in teachers verbal responsiveness to groups of children with ASD who vary in cognitive and language abilities.This study aimed to examine whether verbal responsiveness in special education teachers varied among subgroups of children with autism spectrum disorder (n = 112) who differed in cognitive and language abilities.
Typical use of inverse dynamics in perceiving motion in autistic adults: Exploring computational principles of perception and action.There is increasing evidence for motor difficulties in many people with autism spectrum condition (ASC). These difficulties could be linked to differences in the use of internal models which represent relations between motions and forces/efforts. The use of these internal models may be dependent on the cerebellum which has been shown to be abnormal in autism. Several studies have examined internal computations of forward dynamics (motion from force information) in autism, but few have tested the inverse dynamics computation, that is, the determination of force-related information from motion information. Here, we examined this ability in autistic adults by measuring two perceptual biases which depend on the inverse computation. First, we asked participants whether they experienced a feeling of resistance when moving a delayed cursor, which corresponds to the inertial force of the cursor implied by its motion-both typical and ASC participants reported similar feelings of resistance. Second, participants completed a psychophysical task in which they judged the velocity of a moving hand with or without a visual cue implying inertial force. Both typical and ASC participants perceived the hand moving with the inertial cue to be slower than the hand without it. In both cases, the magnitude of the effects did not differ between the two groups. Our results suggest that the neural systems engaged in the inverse dynamics computation are preserved in ASC, at least in the observed conditions.

Screening in toddlers and preschoolers at risk for autism spectrum disorder: Evaluating a novel mobile-health screening tool.There are many available tools with varying levels of accuracy designed to screen for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in young children, both in the general population and specifically among those referred for developmental concerns. With burgeoning waitlists for comprehensive diagnostic ASD assessments, finding accurate methods and tools for advancing diagnostic triage becomes increasingly important. The current study compares the efficacy of four oft used paper and pencil measures, the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers Revised with Follow-up, the Social Responsiveness Scale, Second Edition, and the Social Communication Questionnaire, and the Child Behavior Checklist to a novel mobile-health screening tool developed by Cognoa, Inc. (Cognoa) in a group of children 18-72 months of age. The Cognoa tool may have potential benefits as it integrates a series of parent-report questions with remote clinical ratings of brief video segments uploaded via parent's smartphones to calculate level of ASD risk. Participants were referred to one of three tertiary care diagnostic centers for ASD-related concerns (n = 230) and received a best estimate ASD diagnosis. Analysis and comparison of psychometric properties indicated potential advantages for Cognoa within this clinical sample across age ranges not often covered by another single measure/tool.

Predictors of quality of life for autistic adults.Research with adults on the autism spectrum is as yet limited in scope and quality. The present study describes quality of life (QoL) of a large sample of autistic adults in the UK and investigates characteristics that may be predictive of QoL. A total of 370 autistic adults from the Adult Autism Spectrum Cohort-UK (ASC-UK) completed the WHOQoL-BREF, and the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS, autism symptom severity), along with the ASC-UK registration questionnaire giving information on mental health and their life situation. QoL for autistic adults was lower than for the general population for each WHOQoL domain. Younger participants reported higher QoL than older participants in psychological and environment domains. Males reported higher physical QoL than females, and females reported higher social QoL than males. Significant positive predictors of QoL were: being employed (physical QoL), receiving support (social and environment QoL), and being in a relationship (social QoL). Having a mental health condition and higher SRS total score were negative predictors of QoL across all four domains. Autistic adults require access to effective mental health interventions, and informal and formal support for their social difficulties, to improve their quality of life. Autism Res 2018, 11: 1138-1147. © 2018 The Authors Autism Research published by International Society for Autism Research and Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: There has been limited research into the lived experience of autistic adults. Using the World Health Organization quality of life measure, we found that autistic people (370) in the UK reported their quality of life to be lower than that of the general population. Better quality of life was associated with being in a relationship; those with a mental health condition had poorer quality of life. This research suggests some ways in which autistic people can be helped to improve their quality of life.
Age and Gender Effects on Intrinsic Connectivity in Autism Using Functional Integration and Segregation.The objective of this study was to examine intrinsic whole-brain functional connectivity in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using the framework of functional segregation and integration. Emphasis was given to potential gender and developmental effects as well as identification of specific networks that may contribute to the global results.
Neuroimmunology Research. A Report from the Cuban Network of Neuroimmunology.Neuroimmunology can be traced back to the XIX century through the descriptions of some of the disease&rsquo;s models (e.g., multiple sclerosis and Guillain Barret syndrome, amongst others). The diagnostic tools are based in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis developed by Quincke or in the development of neuroimmunotherapy with the earlier expression in Pasteur&rsquo;s vaccine for rabies. Nevertheless, this field, which began to become delineated as an independent research area in the 1940s, has evolved as an innovative and integrative field at the shared edges of neurosciences, immunology, and related clinical and research areas, which are currently becoming a major concern for neuroscience and indeed for all of the scientific community linked to it. The workshop focused on several topics: (1) the molecular mechanisms of immunoregulation in health and neurological diseases, (like multiple sclerosis, autism, ataxias, epilepsy, Alzheimer and Parkinson&rsquo;s disease); (2) the use of animal models for neurodegenerative diseases (ataxia, fronto-temporal dementia/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ataxia-telangiectasia); (3) the results of new interventional technologies in neurology, with a special interest in the implementation of surgical techniques and the management of drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy; (4) the use of non-invasive brain stimulation in neurodevelopmental disorders; as well as (5) the efficacy of neuroprotective molecules in neurodegenerative diseases. This paper summarizes the highlights of the symposium.
Effectiveness of a multi-level implementation strategy for ASD interventions: study protocol for two linked cluster randomized trials.The Centers for Disease Control (2018) estimates that 1 in 59 children has autism spectrum disorder, and the annual cost of ASD in the U.S. is estimated to be $236 billion. Evidence-based interventions have been developed and demonstrate effectiveness in improving child outcomes. However, research on generalizable methods to scale up these practices in the multiple service systems caring for these children has been limited and is critical to meet this growing public health need. This project includes two, coordinated studies testing the effectiveness of the Translating Evidence-based Interventions (EBI) for ASD: Multi-Level Implementation Strategy (TEAMS) model. TEAMS focuses on improving implementation leadership, organizational climate, and provider attitudes and motivation in order to improve two key implementation outcomes-provider training completion and intervention fidelity and subsequent child outcomes. The TEAMS Leadership Institute applies implementation leadership strategies and TEAMS Individualized Provider Strategies for training applies motivational interviewing strategies to facilitate provider and organizational behavior change.
Long-term social skills group training for children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder: a randomized controlled trial.Social skills group training (SSGT) is widely used for intellectually able children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Previous studies indicate small to moderate effects on social communication capacities. The duration of most available programs is relatively short, and extended training might lead to further improvement. This randomized controlled trial compared an extended 24-week version of the SSGT program KONTAKT with standard care. The weekly sessions gradually shifted in content from acquisition of new skills to real-world application of the acquired skills. A total of 50 participants with ASD (15 females; 35 males) aged 8-17 years were included. The study was conducted at two child and adolescent psychiatry outpatient units in Sweden. The primary outcome was the Social Responsiveness Scale-Second Edition (SRS-2) rated by parents and blinded teachers. Secondary outcomes included parent- and teacher-rated adaptive behaviors, trainer-rated global functioning and clinical severity, and self-reported child and caregiver stress. Assessments were made at baseline, posttreatment, and at 3-months follow-up. Parent-rated SRS-2 scores indicated large effects posttreatment [- 19.2; 95% CI - 29.9 to - 8.5; p < .001, effect size (ES) = 0.76], which were maintained at follow-up (- 20.7; 95% CI - 31.7 to - 9.7; p < .0001, ES = 0.82). These estimates indicate substantially larger improvement than previously reported for shorter SSGT. However, the effects on teacher-rated SRS-2 and most secondary outcomes did not reach statistical significance. Our results suggest added benefits of extended SSGT training, implying that service providers might reach better results by optimizing the delivery of SSGT.
From aggression to autism: new perspectives on the behavioral sequelae of monoamine oxidase deficiency.The two monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes, A and B, catalyze the metabolism of monoamine neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. The phenotypic outcomes of MAO congenital deficiency have been studied in humans and animal models, to explore the role of these enzymes in behavioral regulation. The clinical condition caused by MAOA deficiency, Brunner syndrome, was first described as a disorder characterized by overt antisocial and aggressive conduct. Building on this discovery, subsequent studies were focused on the characterization of the role of MAOA in the neurobiology of antisocial conduct. MAO A knockout mice were found to display high levels of intermale aggression; however, further analyses of these mutants unveiled additional behavioral abnormalities mimicking the core symptoms of autism-spectrum disorder. These findings were strikingly confirmed in newly reported cases of Brunner syndrome. The role of MAOB in behavioral regulation remains less well-understood, even though Maob-deficient mice have been found to exhibit greater behavioral disinhibition and risk-taking responses, supporting previous clinical studies showing associations between low MAO B activity and impulsivity. Furthermore, lack of MAOB was found to exacerbate the severity of psychopathological deficits induced by concurrent MAOA deficiency. Here, we summarize how the convergence of clinical reports and behavioral phenotyping in mutant mice has helped frame a complex picture of psychopathological features in MAO-deficient individuals, which encompass a broad spectrum of neurodevelopmental problems. This emerging knowledge poses novel conceptual challenges towards the identification of the endophenotypes shared by autism-spectrum disorder, antisocial behavior and impulse-control problems, as well as their monoaminergic underpinnings.
The Interoception Sensory Questionnaire (ISQ): A Scale to Measure Interoceptive Challenges in Adults.Increasing attention is being paid to how adults on the autism spectrum perceive and interpret the interoceptive sense. This 20-item Interoception Sensory Questionnaire represents a single factor scale that can be interpreted as representing confusion about interoceptive bodily states unless these states are extreme (Alexisomia), and has been designed to discriminate across populations (total sample 511 participants). Findings showed that 74% of adults with autism reported interoceptive confusion. Another finding of the study was that as autistic traits increased, interoceptive confusion increased, with adults with diagnosed autism scoring highest on the construct. Implications for physiological self-regulation as well as physical health outcomes are discussed, as well as recommendations for future research.
The Microglial Innate Immune Receptor TREM2 Is Required for Synapse Elimination and Normal Brain Connectivity.The triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a microglial innate immune receptor associated with a lethal form of early, progressive dementia, Nasu-Hakola disease, and with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. Microglial defects in phagocytosis of toxic aggregates or apoptotic membranes were proposed to be at the origin of the pathological processes in the presence of Trem2 inactivating mutations. Here, we show that TREM2 is essential for microglia-mediated synaptic refinement during the early stages of brain development. The absence of Trem2 resulted in impaired synapse elimination, accompanied by enhanced excitatory neurotransmission and reduced long-range functional connectivity. Trem2
Potentially Reversible Social Deficits Among Transgender Youth.Recently, there has been increased attention to a putative relationship between Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and gender dysphoria, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) diagnosis for those whose gender assigned at birth does not match their gender identity. Studies have shown an over-representation of ASD symptoms among transgender youth. These studies, however, have used scales that are non-specific for ASD. These ASD symptoms may represent social deficits that are secondary to social stress and deprivation, as transgender youth suffer high rates of peer and family rejection. These social deficits may not represent true ASD and may be reversible as patients are affirmed in their gender identities and social stress is reduced.
Cytoplasmic FMRP interacting protein 1/2 (CYFIP1/2) expression analysis in autism.Cytoplasmic FMRP interacting proteins 1 and 2 (CYFIP1/2) have been previously shown to be associated with central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Moreover, dysregulation of their expression levels results in disturbances in CNS maturation and neuronal interconnections. In the present study, we compared expression levels of CYFIP1/2 in peripheral blood of 30 ASD patients and 41 healthy subjects by means of real time PCR. Expression analysis showed significant over-expression of CYFIP1/2 in ASD patients compared with healthy subjects (Fold change = 3.252, P < 0.0001 and Fold change = 4.14, P = 0.001 respectively). Such over-expression was also seen for CYFIP1 in male and female patients when compared with the corresponding control subjects. In addition, a significant correlation was found between CYFIP1 transcript levels and age in female subjects. A significant correlation was detected between expression levels of these genes in control subjects. The current study provides further supports for contribution of CYFIP1/2 in the pathogenesis of ASD and potentiates it as a peripheral marker for ASD diagnosis. Future studies in larger sample sizes are needed to confirm the results of the current study.
Tracking the Influence of Autistic Traits on Competencies Among School Aged Children with Subthreshold Autistic Traits: A Longitudinal Study.This study aims to further explore the implications of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms for children who do not meet full diagnostic criteria. More specific characterization of how challenges present relative to traits of ASD such as social responsiveness is vital to developing an understanding of what competency and mental health difficulties these impairments are related to, and if they persist over time. Assessments of autistic traits, clinical symptomotology, and competency were used to quantify the relation of these domains cross-sectionally and across time. Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) scores significantly contributed to a teacher-report Happy scale from the Teacher's Report Form and a parent-report Social scale from the Child Behavior Checklist. No significant longitudinal models emerged. Splitting the SRS scores into three severity classes revealed that impaired social responsiveness is significantly related to competency, unlike average or below average deficits. Implications of subthreshold ASD traits on competency outcomes are discussed.
Amantadine: A new treatment for refractory electrical status epilepticus in sleep.Electrical status epilepticus in sleep (ESES) is an electrographic abnormality linked to language abnormalities and cognitive dysfunction and specifically associated with Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS), the syndrome of continuous spike and wave in slow-wave sleep (CSWS), and autistic regression with epileptiform EEG (AREE). As first-line therapies for treatment of ESES display inadequate efficacy and confer substantial risk, we set out to describe our center's experience with amantadine in the treatment of ESES.
A Statistical Framework for Mapping Risk Genes from De Novo Mutations in Whole-Genome-Sequencing Studies.Analysis of de novo mutations (DNMs) from sequencing data of nuclear families has identified risk genes for many complex diseases, including multiple neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Most of these efforts have focused on mutations in protein-coding sequences. Evidence from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) strongly suggests that variants important to human diseases often lie in non-coding regions. Extending DNM-based approaches to non-coding sequences is challenging, however, because the functional significance of non-coding mutations is difficult to predict. We propose a statistical framework for analyzing DNMs from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. This method, TADA-Annotations (TADA-A), is a major advance of the TADA method we developed earlier for DNM analysis in coding regions. TADA-A is able to incorporate many functional annotations such as conservation and enhancer marks, to learn from data which annotations are informative of pathogenic mutations, and to combine both coding and non-coding mutations at the gene level to detect risk genes. It also supports meta-analysis of multiple DNM studies, while adjusting for study-specific technical effects. We applied TADA-A to WGS data of ∼300 autism-affected family trios across five studies and discovered several autism risk genes. The software is freely available for all research uses.
Seeing More Than Human: Autism and Anthropomorphic Theory of Mind.Theory of mind (ToM) is defined as the process of taking another's perspective. Anthropomorphism can be seen as the extension of ToM to non-human entities. This review examines the literature concerning ToM and anthropomorphism in relation to individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), specifically addressing the questions of how and why those on the spectrum both show an increased interest for anthropomorphism and may even show improved ToM abilities when judging the mental states of anthropomorphic characters. This review highlights that while individuals with ASD traditionally show deficits on a wide range of ToM tests, such as recognizing facial emotions, such ToM deficits may be ameliorated if the stimuli presented is cartoon or animal-like rather than in human form. Individuals with ASD show a greater interest in anthropomorphic characters and process the features of these characters using methods typically reserved for human stimuli. Personal accounts of individuals with ASD also suggest they may identify more closely with animals than other humans. It is shown how the social motivations hypothesized to underlie the anthropomorphizing of non-human targets may lead those on the spectrum to seek social connections and therefore gain ToM experience and expertise amongst unlikely sources.
Autistic traits, but not schizotypy, predict increased weighting of sensory information in Bayesian visual integration.Recent theories propose that schizophrenia/schizotypy and autistic spectrum disorder are related to impairments in Bayesian inference that is, how the brain integrates sensory information (likelihoods) with prior knowledge. However existing accounts fail to clarify: (i) how proposed theories differ in accounts of ASD vs. schizophrenia and (ii) whether the impairments result from weaker priors or enhanced likelihoods. Here, we directly address these issues by characterizing how 91 healthy participants, scored for autistic and schizotypal traits, implicitly learned and combined priors with sensory information. This was accomplished through a visual statistical learning paradigm designed to quantitatively assess variations in individuals' likelihoods and priors. The acquisition of the priors was found to be intact along both traits spectra. However, autistic traits were associated with more veridical perception and weaker influence of expectations. Bayesian modeling revealed that this was due, not to weaker prior expectations, but to more precise sensory representations.
Acceptability and caregiver-reported outcomes for young children with autism spectrum disorder whose parents attended a preventative population-based intervention for anxiety: A pilot study.This pilot study explored acceptability to parents and outcomes for children of a preventive intervention for anxiety problems in pre-schoolers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who were an identified sub-group within a population-based randomised trial of the Cool Little Kids parenting group programme. The population trial included 545 temperamentally inhibited pre-schoolers recruited across eight economically diverse areas of Melbourne, Australia. Within this sample, 26 parents reported that their child had received an ASD diagnosis. Trial measures included baseline inhibited temperament and developmental problems, post-intervention feedback on the programme, and caregiver-reported child mental health outcomes (anxiety diagnoses and internalising symptoms) at 1- and 2-year follow-up. Sample retention for the children with ASD over 2 years was strong (92%). At follow-up, fewer intervention than control children with ASD had anxiety disorders after 1 year (% (n): 25 (3) vs. 77 (10), P = .028) and separation anxiety symptoms after 2 years (M (SD): 4.22 (2.68) vs. 9.38 (5.91), P = .017). Similar effects favouring the intervention group were apparent across other child emotional outcome measures but without statistical significance in this small sample. Parents of the children with ASD reported that Cool Little Kids was "quite useful" in relation to their child's anxiety but also gave feedback that they would appreciate some tailoring of programme content to the context of ASD. These pilot findings suggest Cool Little Kids may be helpful for reducing comorbid anxiety in pre-schoolers with ASD. Further research is warranted to develop an ASD-specific adaptation which can be trialled with a larger sample of children with confirmed ASD diagnosis.

LAY SUMMARY: Many children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) also have anxiety. This pilot study explored acceptability to parents and outcomes for pre-schoolers with ASD of a parenting group programme to prevent anxiety problems. Among the sample of 26 pre-schoolers with ASD, we found reduced anxiety disorders and separation symptoms when their parents had received the intervention, as reported by caregivers in checklists and clinical interviews. Parents gave feedback that the programme was useful but suggested content be adapted to the context of ASD.
Autism Spectrum Disorder: Classification, diagnosis and therapy.Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) refers to a group of neurodevelopmental disorders including autism, Asperger's syndrome (AS) and pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). The new diagnostic criteria of ASD focuses on two core domains: social communication impairment and restricted interests/repetitive behaviors. The prevalence of ASD has been steadily increasing over the past two decades, with current estimates reaching up to 1 in 36 children. Hereditary factors, parental history of psychiatric disorders, pre-term births, and fetal exposure to psychotropic drugs or insecticides have all been linked to higher risk of ASD. Several scales such as the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), The Autism Spectrum Disorder-Observation for Children (ASD-OC), The Developmental, Dimensional, and Diagnostic Interview (3di), are available to aid in better assessing the behaviors and symptoms associated with ASD. Nearly 75% of ASD patients suffer from comorbid psychiatric illnesses or conditions, which may include attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, Tourette syndrome, and others. Both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions are available for ASD. Pharmacological treatments include psychostimulants, atypical antipsychotics, antidepressants, and alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists. These medications provide partial symptomatic relief of core symptoms of ASD or manage the symptoms of comorbid conditions. Non-pharmacological interventions, which show promising evidence in improving social interaction and verbal communication of ASD patients, include music therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy and social behavioral therapy. Hormonal therapies with oxytocyin or vasopressin receptor antagonists have also shown some promise in improving core ASD symptoms. The use of vitamins, herbal remedies and nutritional supplements in conjunction with pharmacological and behavioral treatment appear to have some effect in symptomatic improvement in ASD, though additional studies are needed to confirm these benefits. Developing novel disease-modifying therapies may prove to be the ultimate intervention for sustained improvement of symptoms in ASD.
The Autism-Related Protein CHD8 Cooperates with C/EBPβ to Regulate Adipogenesis.The gene encoding the chromatin remodeler CHD8 is the most frequently mutated gene in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Heterozygous mutations in CHD8 give rise to ASD that is often accompanied by macrocephaly, gastrointestinal complaints, and slender habitus. Whereas most phenotypes of CHD8 haploinsufficiency likely result from delayed neurodevelopment, the mechanism underlying slender habitus has remained unknown. Here, we show that CHD8 interacts with CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) and promotes its transactivation activity during adipocyte differentiation. Adipogenesis was impaired in Chd8-deleted preadipocytes, with the upregulation of C/EBPα and peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), two master regulators of this process, being attenuated in mutant cells. Furthermore, mice with CHD8 ablation in white preadipocytes had a markedly reduced white adipose tissue mass. Our findings reveal a mode of C/EBPβ regulation by CHD8 during adipogenesis, with CHD8 deficiency resulting in a defect in the development of white adipose tissue.
NR4A2 haploinsufficiency is associated with intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder.NR4A2, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is involved in modulation of target gene transcription, regulating several developmental processes such as regulation of cellular homeostasis, neuronal development, inflammation and carcinogenesis. 2q24.1 deletions are extremely rare, and only 1 patient with a de novo deletion encompassing only NR4A2 gene was reported so far. We report 3 additional patients with a de novo deletion encompassing NR4A2: 2 patients have deletions encompassing only NR4A2 gene and 1 patient has a deletion including NR4A2 and the first exon of GPD2. Our patients presented a neurodevelopmental disorder including language impairment, developmental delay, intellectual disability and/or autism spectrum disorder. We suggest that NR4A2 haploinsufficiency is implicated in neurodevelopmental disorder with high penetrance.
Pathobiology of Christianson syndrome: Linking disrupted endosomal-lysosomal function with intellectual disability and sensory impairments.Christianson syndrome (CS) is a recently described rare neurogenetic disorder presenting early in life with a broad range of neurological symptoms, including severe intellectual disability with nonverbal status, hyperactivity, epilepsy, and progressive ataxia due to cerebellar atrophy. CS is due to loss-of-function mutations in SLC9A6, encoding NHE6, a sodium-hydrogen exchanger involved in the regulation of early endosomal pH. Here we review what is currently known about the neuropathogenesis of CS, based on insights from experimental models, which to date have focused on mechanisms that affect the CNS, specifically the brain. In addition, parental reports of sensory disturbances in their children with CS, including an apparent insensitivity to pain, led us to explore sensory function and related neuropathology in Slc9a6 KO mice. We present new data showing sensory deficits in Slc9a6 KO mice, which had reduced behavioral responses to noxious thermal and mechanical stimuli (Hargreaves and Von Frey assays, respectively) compared to wild type (WT) littermates. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analysis of the spinal cord and peripheral nervous system revealed intracellular accumulation of the glycosphingolipid GM2 ganglioside in KO but not WT mice. This cellular storage phenotype was most abundant in neurons of lamina I-II of the dorsal horn, a major relay site in the processing of painful stimuli. Spinal cords of KO mice also exhibited changes in astroglial and microglial populations throughout the gray matter suggestive of a neuroinflammatory process. Our findings establish the Slc9a6 KO mouse as a relevant tool for studying the sensory deficits in CS, and highlight selective vulnerabilities in relevant cell populations that may contribute to this phenotype. How NHE6 loss of function leads to such a multifaceted neurological syndrome is still undefined, and it is likely that NHE6 is involved with many cellular processes critical to normal nervous system development and function. In addition, the sensory issues exhibited by Slc9a6 KO mice, in combination with our neuropathological findings, are consistent with NHE6 loss of function impacting the entire nervous system. Sensory dysfunction in intellectually disabled individuals is challenging to assess and may impair patient safety and quality of life. Further mechanistic studies of the neurological impairments underlying CS and other genetic intellectual disability disorders must also take into account mechanisms affecting broader nervous system function in order to understand the full range of associated disabilities.
Could Autism Be Associated With Nutritional Status in the Palestinian population? The Outcomes of the Palestinian Micronutrient Survey.Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder. It is believed that the cause of autism is multifactorial, where genetic predispositions interact with environmental factors. In this context, micronutrients play a crucial role.
Teaching social perception skills to adolescents with autism and intellectual disabilities using video-based group instruction.Few interventions focus on teaching social skills to adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disabilities (ID) that are consistently used during interactions with peers ( Carter et al., 2014). The present study evaluated the effects of video-based group instruction (VGI) on the acquisition of social perception skills of five adolescents with ASD or ID in a public school setting. Social perception involves observing affective behaviors of others, discriminating relevant environmental stimuli, and differentially reinforcing the affective behavior of another person. Typically developing peers supported VGI implementation as social partners for participants. A multiple probe design across behaviors demonstrated the effectiveness of VGI for teaching social perception skills. Four of five participants acquired and maintained the targeted social perception skills, and we observed some transfer to a nontreatment setting. Results of this study suggest VGI may support the acquisition of social perception among adolescents with ASD or ID.
TPH2 polymorphisms across the spectrum of psychiatric morbidity: A systematic review and meta-analysis.Tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) is the rate-limiting enzyme in brain serotonin synthesis. The TPH2 gene has frequently been investigated in relation to psychiatric morbidity. The aim of the present review is to integrate results from association studies between TPH2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and various psychiatric disorders, which we furthermore quantified with meta-analysis. We reviewed 166 studies investigating 69 TPH2 SNPs in a broad range of psychiatric disorders, including over 30,000 patients. According to our meta-analysis, TPH2 polymorphisms show strongest associations with mood disorders, suicide (attempt) and schizophrenia. Despite small effect sizes, we conclude that TPH2 SNPs in the coding and non-coding areas (rs4570625, rs11178997, rs11178998, rs10748185, rs1843809, rs4290270, rs17110747) are each associated with one or more psychopathological conditions. Our findings highlight the possible common serotonergic mechanisms of the investigated psychiatric disorders. Yet, the functional relevance of most TPH2 polymorphisms is unclear. Characterizing how exactly the different TPH2 variants influence the serotonergic neurotransmission is a next necessary step in understanding the psychiatric disorders where serotonin is implicated.
Behavioral Coping Plans: One Inter-Professional Team's Approach to Patient-Centered Care.Surgical encounters for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are stressful to patients, families and health care providers. It is recognized that parents best anticipate needs of children with ASD. Including a family in the plan of care for the child is imperative. In response to the need for targeted, tailored care, an inter-professional surgical services team convened to determine best practices for addressing a behavioral and developmental plan for children with ASD in the surgical services arena.
Measurement properties of tools used to assess suicidality in autistic and general population adults: A systematic review.Adults diagnosed with autism are at significantly increased risk of suicidal thoughts, suicidal behaviours and dying by suicide. However, it is unclear whether any validated tools are currently available to effectively assess suicidality in autistic adults in research and clinical practice. This is crucial for understanding and preventing premature death by suicide in this vulnerable group. This two stage systematic review therefore aimed to identify tools used to assess suicidality in autistic and general population adults, evaluate these tools for their appropriateness and measurement properties, and make recommendations for appropriate selection of suicidality assessment tools in research and clinical practice. Three databases were searched (PsycInfo, Medline and Web of Knowledge). Four frequently used suicidality assessment tools were identified, and subsequently rated for quality of the evidence in support of their measurement properties using the COSMIN checklist. Despite studies having explored suicidality in autistic adults, none had utilised a validated tool. Overall, there was lack of evidence in support of suicidality risk assessments successfully predicting future suicide attempts. We recommend adaptations to current suicidality assessment tools and priorities for future research, in order to better conceptualise suicidality and its measurement in autism.
Closed Loop Deep Brain Stimulation for PTSD, Addiction, and Disorders of Affective Facial Interpretation: Review and Discussion of Potential Biomarkers and Stimulation Paradigms.The treatment of psychiatric diseases with Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is becoming more of a reality as studies proliferate the indications and targets for therapies. Opinions on the initial failures of DBS trials for some psychiatric diseases point to a certain lack of finesse in using an Open Loop DBS (OLDBS) system in these dynamic, cyclical pathologies. OLDBS delivers monomorphic input into dysfunctional brain circuits with modulation of that input via human interface at discrete time points with no interim modulation or adaptation to the changing circuit dynamics. Closed Loop DBS (CLDBS) promises dynamic, intrinsic circuit modulation based on individual physiologic biomarkers of dysfunction. Discussed here are several psychiatric diseases which may be amenable to CLDBS paradigms as the neurophysiologic dysfunction is stochastic and not static. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) has several peripheral and central physiologic and neurologic changes preceding stereotyped hyper-activation behavioral responses. Biomarkers for CLDBS potentially include skin conductance changes indicating changes in the sympathetic nervous system, changes in serum and central neurotransmitter concentrations, and limbic circuit activation. Chemical dependency and addiction have been demonstrated to be improved with both ablation and DBS of the Nucleus Accumbens and as a serendipitous side effect of movement disorder treatment. Potential peripheral biomarkers are similar to those proposed for PTSD with possible use of environmental and geolocation based cues, peripheral signs of physiologic arousal, and individual changes in central circuit patterns. Non-substance addiction disorders have also been serendipitously treated in patients with OLDBS for movement disorders. As more is learned about these behavioral addictions, DBS targets and effectors will be identified. Finally, discussed is the use of facial recognition software to modulate activation of inappropriate responses for psychiatric diseases in which misinterpretation of social cues feature prominently. These include Autism Spectrum Disorder, PTSD, and Schizophrenia-all of which have a common feature of dysfunctional interpretation of facial affective clues. Technological advances and improvements in circuit-based, individual-specific, real-time adaptable modulation, forecast functional neurosurgery treatments for heretofore treatment-resistant behavioral diseases.
Early gesture use in fragile X syndrome.Emerging evidence suggests that children with fragile X syndrome (FXS) exhibit abnormal gesture use early in development, although few studies have investigated the emergence of gesture use in this population or the impact of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) features on these behaviours. The present study examined the longitudinal development of gesture use in infants with FXS relative to low-risk controls and infant siblings of children with ASD (high-risk siblings), with the goal of establishing potentially unique patterns of gesture development in infants with FXS and understanding the relative impact of ASD symptom severity on these patterns.
A treatment comparison study of a photo activity schedule and Social Stories for teaching social skills to children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: brief report.To compare the efficacy of two procedures, a photo activity schedule intervention and Social Stories, to teach social skills to four children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).
Development of the Mental Synthesis Evaluation Checklist (MSEC): A Parent-Report Tool for Mental Synthesis Ability Assessment in Children with Language Delay.Mental synthesis is the conscious purposeful process of synthesizing novel mental images from objects stored in memory. Mental synthesis ability is essential for understanding complex syntax, spatial prepositions, and verb tenses. In typical children, the timeline of mental synthesis acquisition is highly correlated with an increasing vocabulary. Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), on the other hand, may learn hundreds of words but never acquire mental synthesis. In these individuals, tests assessing vocabulary comprehension may fail to demonstrate the profound deficit in mental synthesis. We developed a parent-reported Mental Synthesis Evaluation Checklist (MSEC) designed to assess mental synthesis acquisition in ASD children. The psychometric quality of MSEC was tested with 3715 parents of ASD children. Internal reliability of the 20-item MSEC was good (Cronbach's alpha >0.9). MSEC exhibited adequate test⁻retest reliability; good construct validity, supported by a positive correlation with the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC) Communication subscale; and good known group validity reflected by the difference in MSEC scores for children of different ASD severity levels. The MSEC questionnaire is copyright-free and can be used by researchers as a complimentary subscale for the ATEC evaluation. We hope that the addition of MSEC will make the combined assessment more sensitive to small steps in a child's development. As MSEC does not rely on productive language, it may be an especially useful tool for assessing the development of nonverbal and minimally verbal children.
The psychometric properties of the mindful attention awareness scale among Arab parents of children with autism spectrum disorder.The purpose of this study was to examine the psychometric properties and the theoretical structure of the mindful attention awareness scale (MAAS) with parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in Jordan.
Prevalence of antibodies against Borna disease virus proteins in Japanese children with autism spectrum disorder.Bornavirus infection is observed in both animals, including humans. However, bornavirus epidemiology in humans, especially in children, remains unclear. Here, we evaluated antibodies against bornaviruses in Japanese children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using immunofluorescence analysis, western blotting, and radio ligand assay. The prevalence of antibodies against bornavirus-specific speckles, N, and P proteins were 22%, 48%, and 33%, respectively, in the ASD children. According to our criteria, the prevalence of antibodies against bornaviruses was 7.4% in the ASD children. This is the first report of the serological prevalence of bornavirus in Japanese children. Our results provide valuable baseline-data regarding bornavirus epidemiology in children for future studies.
Dysbiosis of microbiome and probiotic treatment in a genetic model of autism spectrum disorders.Recent studies have determined that the microbiome has direct effects on behavior, and may be dysregulated in neurodevelopmental conditions. Considering that neurodevelopmental conditions, such as autism, have a strong genetic etiology, it is necessary to understand if genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Shank3, can influence the gut microbiome, and if probiotics can be a therapeutic tool. In this study, we have identified dysregulation of several genera and species of bacteria in the gut and colon of both male and female Shank3 KO mice. L. reuteri, a species with decreased relative abundance in the Shank3 KO mice, positively correlated with the expression of gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor subunits in the brain. Treatment of Shank3 KO mice with L. reuteri induced an attenuation of unsocial behavior specifically in male Shank3 mice, and a decrease in repetitive behaviors in both male and female Shank3 KO mice. In addition, L. reuteri treatment affected GABA receptor gene expression and protein levels in multiple brain regions. This study identifies bacterial species that are sensitive to an autism-related mutation, and further suggests a therapeutic potential for probiotic treatment.
Genomic Deletion Involving the IMMP2L Gene in Two Cases of Autism Spectrum Disorder.Mutations/deletions of the IMMP2L gene have been associated with different cognitive/behavioral disturbances, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The penetrance of these defects is not complete since they often are inherited from a healthy parent. Using array-CGH in a cohort of 37 ASD patients, we found 2 subjects harboring a deletion inside the IMMP2L gene. In both cases, the IMMP2L gene deletion was inherited: from a healthy mother in one case and from a dyslectic father in the other. In the latter family, the IMMP2L deletion was also detected in the patient's brother, who showed delayed language development. In a cohort of 100 normal controls, no deletions including the IMMP2L gene were observed. However, a recent meta-analysis found no association between IMMP2L deletions and ASD. Our data would indicate that deletions involving the IMMP2L gene may contribute to the development of a subgroup of cognitive/behavioral disorders.
Superior Visual Search and Crowding Abilities Are Not Characteristic of All Individuals on the Autism Spectrum.Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often excel on visual search and crowding tasks; however, inconsistent findings suggest that this 'islet of ability' may not be characteristic of the entire spectrum. We examined whether performance on these tasks changed as a function of motor proficiency in children with varying levels of ASD symptomology. Children with high ASD symptomology outperformed all others on complex visual search tasks, but only if their motor skills were rated at, or above, age expectations. For the visual crowding task, children with high ASD symptomology and superior motor skills exhibited enhanced target discrimination, whereas those with high ASD symptomology but poor motor skills experienced deficits. These findings may resolve some of the discrepancies in the literature.
The categorisation of resistance: interpreting failure to follow a proposed line of action in the diagnosis of autism amongst young adults.Many characteristics typical of autism, a neurodevelopmental condition characterised by socio-communicative impairments, are most evident during social interaction. Accordingly, procedures such as the Autism Diagnosis Observation Schedule (ADOS) are interactive and intended to elicit interactional impairments: a diagnosis of autism is given if interactional difficulties are attributed as a persistent quality of the individual undergoing diagnosis. This task is difficult, first, because behaviours can be interpreted in various ways and, second, because conversation breakdown may indicate a disengagement with, or resistance to, a line of conversation. Drawing upon conversation analysis, we examine seven ADOS diagnosis sessions and ask how diagnosticians distinguish between interactional resistance as, on the one hand, a diagnostic indicator and, on the other, as a reasonable choice from a range of possible responses. We find evidence of various forms of resistance during ADOS sessions, but it is a resistance to a line of conversational action that is often determined to be indicative of autism. However, and as we show, this attribution of resistance can be ambiguous. We conclude by arguing for reflexive practice during any diagnosis where talk is the problem, and for a commitment to acknowledge the potential impact of diagnostic procedures themselves upon results.
Burden of de novo mutations and inherited rare single nucleotide variants in children with sensory processing dysfunction.In children with sensory processing dysfunction (SPD), who do not meet criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or intellectual disability, the contribution of de novo pathogenic mutation in neurodevelopmental genes is unknown and in need of investigation. We hypothesize that children with SPD may have pathogenic variants in genes that have been identified as causing other neurodevelopmental disorders including ASD. This genetic information may provide important insight into the etiology of sensory processing dysfunction and guide clinical evaluation and care.
Association of developing childhood epilepsy subsequent to febrile seizure: A population-based cohort study.Epilepsy is an important neurological condition that frequently associated with neurobehavioral disorders in childhood. Our aim was to identify the risk of developing epilepsy subsequent to febrile seizure and the association between epilepsy risk factors and neurobehavioral disorders.
Computerized Cognitive Training in Children With Autism and Intellectual Disabilities: Feasibility and Satisfaction Study.Researchers are increasingly interested in testing and developing computerized cognitive training interventions for individuals with autism spectrum disorder due to the limited accessibility of treatments for this disorder. Understanding the feasibility of testing cognitive interventions for this population is critical, especially for individuals with ASD who have low to moderate intellectual ability.
Reading Comprehension in Children With and Without ASD: The Role of Word Reading, Oral Language, and Working Memory.Word reading and oral language predict reading comprehension, which is generally poor, in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, working memory (WM), despite documented weaknesses, has not been thoroughly investigated as a predictor of reading comprehension in ASD. This study examined the role of three parallel WM N-back tasks using abstract shapes, familiar objects, and written words in children (8-14 years) with ASD (n = 19) and their typically developing peers (n = 24). All three types of WM were significant predictors of reading comprehension when considered alone. However, these relationships were rendered non-significant with the addition of age, word reading, vocabulary, and group entered into the models. Oral vocabulary emerged as the strongest predictor of reading comprehension.
Palmitoylethanolamide as adjunctive therapy for autism: Efficacy and safety results from a randomized controlled trial.Inflammation as well as glutamate excitotoxicity have been proposed to participate in the propagation of autism. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is an endocannabinoid proven to prevent glutamatergic toxicity and inhibit inflammatory responses simultaneously. The present randomized, parallel group, double-blind placebo-controlled trial is the first study depicted to probe the efficacy of co-treatment with risperidone and PEA over 10 weeks in children with autism. Seventy children (aged 4-12 years) with autism and moderate to severe symptoms of irritability were randomly assigned to two treatment regimens. The study outcomes were measured using the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community Edition (ABC-C). At trial endpoint (week 10), combination of PEA and risperidone had superior efficacy in ameliorating the ABC-irritability and hyperactivity/noncompliance symptoms (Cohen's d, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.94, 0.41 to 1.46, p = 0.001) compared with a risperidone plus placebo regimen. Interestingly, effect of combination treatment on hyperactivity symptoms was also observed at trial midpoint (week 5) but with a smaller effect size (d = 0.53, p = 0.04) than that at the endpoint (d = 0.94, p = 0.001). Meanwhile, there was a trend toward significance for superior effect of risperidone plus PEA over risperidone plus placebo on inappropriate speech at trial endpoint (d = 0.51, p = 0.051). No significant differences existed between the two treatment groups for the other two ABC-C subscales (lethargy/social withdrawal and stereotypic behavior). The findings suggest that PEA may augment therapeutic effects of risperidone on autism-related irritability and hyperactivity. Future studies are warranted to investigate whether PEA can serve as a stand-alone treatment for autism.
Social interaction-induced activation of RNA splicing in the amygdala of microbiome-deficient mice.Social behaviour is regulated by activity of host-associated microbiota across multiple species. However, the molecular mechanisms mediating this relationship remain elusive. We therefore determined the dynamic, stimulus-dependent transcriptional regulation of germ-free (GF) and GF mice colonised post weaning (exGF) in the amygdala, a brain region critically involved in regulating social interaction. In GF mice the dynamic response seen in controls was attenuated and replaced by a marked increase in expression of splicing factors and alternative exon usage in GF mice upon stimulation, which was even more pronounced in exGF mice. In conclusion, we demonstrate a molecular basis for how the host microbiome is crucial for a normal behavioural response during social interaction. Our data further suggest that social behaviour is correlated with the gene-expression response in the amygdala, established during neurodevelopment as a result of host-microbe interactions. Our findings may help toward understanding neurodevelopmental events leading to social behaviour dysregulation, such as those found in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).
Dexmedetomidine and propofol sedation requirements in an autistic rat model.Autism is a challenging neurodevelopmental disorder. Previous clinical observations suggest altered sedation requirements for autistic children. Our study aimed to test this observation experimentally with an animal model and, to explore its possible mechanisms.
Are therapeutic diets an emerging additional choice in autism spectrum disorder management?A nutritional background has been recognized in the pathophysiology of autism and a series of nutritional interventions have been considered as complementary therapeutic options. As available treatments and interventions are not effective in all individuals, new therapies could broaden management options for these patients. Our aim is to provide current literature data about the effect of therapeutic diets on autism spectrum disorder.
Early Seizures Prematurely Unsilence Auditory Synapses to Disrupt Thalamocortical Critical Period Plasticity.Heightened neural excitability in infancy and childhood results in increased susceptibility to seizures. Such early-life seizures are associated with language deficits and autism that can result from aberrant development of the auditory cortex. Here, we show that early-life seizures disrupt a critical period (CP) for tonotopic map plasticity in primary auditory cortex (A1). We show that this CP is characterized by a prevalence of "silent," NMDA-receptor (NMDAR)-only, glutamate receptor synapses in auditory cortex that become "unsilenced" due to activity-dependent AMPA receptor (AMPAR) insertion. Induction of seizures prior to this CP occludes tonotopic map plasticity by prematurely unsilencing NMDAR-only synapses. Further, brief treatment with the AMPAR antagonist NBQX following seizures, prior to the CP, prevents synapse unsilencing and permits subsequent A1 plasticity. These findings reveal that early-life seizures modify CP regulators and suggest that therapeutic targets for early post-seizure treatment can rescue CP plasticity.
Identification of urinary metabolites that correlate with clinical improvements in children with autism treated with sulforaphane from broccoli.Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have urinary metabolites suggesting impairments in several pathways, including oxidative stress, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and gut microbiome alterations. Sulforaphane, a supplement with indirect antioxidant effects that are derived from broccoli sprouts and seeds, was recently shown to lead to improvements in behavior and social responsiveness in children with ASD. We conducted the current open-label study to determine if we could identify changes in urinary metabolites that were associated with clinical improvements with the goal of identifying a potential mechanism of action.
Statistical Learning is Associated with Autism Symptoms and Verbal Abilities in Young Children with Autism.Statistical learning-extracting regularities in the environment-may underlie complex social behavior. 124 children, 56 with autism and 68 typically developing, ages 2-8 years, completed a novel visual statistical learning task on an iPad. Averaged together, children with autism demonstrated less learning on the task compared to typically developing children. However, multivariate classification analyses characterized individual behavior patterns, and demonstrated a subset of children with autism had similar learning patterns to typically developing children and that subset of children had less severe autism symptoms. Therefore, statistically averaging data resulted in missing critical heterogeneity. Variability in statistical learning may help to understand differences in autism symptoms across individuals and could be used to tailor and inform treatment decisions.
The Estimated Prevalence of Autism in School-Aged Children Living in Rural Nepal Using a Population-Based Screening Tool.Few data exist on the prevalence of autism in low-income countries. We translated, adapted and tested the acceptability of a Nepali-language version of a screening tool for autism (Autism Quotient-10). Using this tool, we estimated autism prevalence in 4098 rural Nepali children aged 9-13 years. Fourteen children scored > 6 out of 10, indicative of elevated autistic symptomatology, of which 13 also screened positive for disability. If the AQ-10 screening tool is as sensitive and specific in the Nepali population as it is in the UK, this would yield an estimated true prevalence of 3 in 1000 (95% confidence interval 2-5 in 1000). Future research is required to validate this tool through in-depth assessments of high-scoring children.
Human-Specific NOTCH2NL Genes Affect Notch Signaling and Cortical Neurogenesis.Genetic changes causing brain size expansion in human evolution have remained elusive. Notch signaling is essential for radial glia stem cell proliferation and is a determinant of neuronal number in the mammalian cortex. We find that three paralogs of human-specific NOTCH2NL are highly expressed in radial glia. Functional analysis reveals that different alleles of NOTCH2NL have varying potencies to enhance Notch signaling by interacting directly with NOTCH receptors. Consistent with a role in Notch signaling, NOTCH2NL ectopic expression delays differentiation of neuronal progenitors, while deletion accelerates differentiation into cortical neurons. Furthermore, NOTCH2NL genes provide the breakpoints in 1q21.1 distal deletion/duplication syndrome, where duplications are associated with macrocephaly and autism and deletions with microcephaly and schizophrenia. Thus, the emergence of human-specific NOTCH2NL genes may have contributed to the rapid evolution of the larger human neocortex, accompanied by loss of genomic stability at the 1q21.1 locus and resulting recurrent neurodevelopmental disorders.
Randomized Control Trial of COMPASS for Improving Transition Outcomes of Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder.The postsecondary outcomes of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are significantly worse than peers with other disabilities. One problem is the lack of empirically-supported transition planning interventions to guide services and help produce better outcomes. We applied an implementation science approach to adapt and modify an evidence-based consultation intervention originally tested with young children called the Collaborative Model for Promoting Competence and Success (COMPASS; Ruble et al., The collaborative model for promoting competence and success for students with ASD. Springer, New York, 2012a) and evaluate it for efficacy in a randomized controlled trial for transition-age youth. Results replicated findings with younger students with ASD that IEP outcomes were higher for COMPASS compared to the placebo control group (d = 2.1). Consultant fidelity was high and teacher adherence improved over time, replicating the importance of ongoing teacher coaching.
Parent-Child Interaction Synchrony for Infants At-Risk for Autism Spectrum Disorder.This study investigated interactions between parents and 12-month-old infants at high (HR-SIBS; n = 27) and low (LR-SIBS; n = 14) familial risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The contributions of parental variables, as well as child's autism symptom severity and verbal skills, to the parent interaction style were examined. Parents of HR-SIBS exhibited a higher level of synchronous-demanding behaviors, which was associated with parental report of atypical mood in the infant, but not with autism symptom severity, verbal skills, or parental depressive symptoms. These preliminary findings suggest a need for further investigation into HR-SIBS' emotional development and parental perception of that development, as these factors may shape parent-child interaction and influence the effectiveness of parent-assisted early intervention programs.
Evidence for Association Between OXTR Gene and ASD Clinical Phenotypes.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is an early-onset neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in social behaviors and communication. Oxytocin and its signaling pathway are related to a range of human behaviors, from facial expression recognition to aggressive behaviors, and have been suggested as involved in the etiology of ASD. Our aim was to evaluate the influence of two polymorphisms (rs1042778, rs53576) at the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) on ASD diagnosis and on specific ASD-related clinical symptoms (seizures, panic, and aggressive behaviors). We also assessed if these SNPs could be related to changes in OXTR availability and functionality using a bioinformatic approach. The sample was composed by 209 probands with ASD and their biological parents. Family-based approach and logistic regression models were used to investigated the outcomes. We observed that panic and aggressive behaviors were nominally associated with presence of rs1042778 T allele (P = 0.019/P
Strong correlation of downregulated genes related to synaptic transmission and mitochondria in post-mortem autism cerebral cortex.Genetic studies in autism have pinpointed a heterogeneous group of loci and genes. Further, environment may be an additional factor conferring susceptibility to autism. Transcriptome studies investigate quantitative differences in gene expression between patient-derived tissues and control. These studies may pinpoint genes relevant to pathophysiology yet circumvent the need to understand genetic architecture or gene-by-environment interactions leading to disease.
RIT2: responsible and susceptible gene for neurological and psychiatric disorders.RIT2 gene was recently introduced as a susceptibility gene in neurological disorders, a group of major problems in human society affecting millions of people worldwide. Several variants, including single nucleotide polymorphisms and CNVs, have been identified and studied in different populations. In this review, we have summarized the studies relevant to the RIT2 gene and its related disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and autism. The protein product of RIT2 is a member of the Ras superfamily that plays important roles in many vital cellular functions, such as differentiation and survival. We have also investigated the protein network of the RIT2 protein and the diseases related to members of this network so as to obtain some clues for future studies by identifying the molecular pathophysiology of neurological disorders and revealing new possible disorders related to RIT2.
Current Knowledge on Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) from Animal Biology to Humans, from Pregnancy to Adulthood: Highlights from a National Italian Meeting.Wildlife has often presented and suggested the effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Animal studies have given us an important opportunity to understand the mechanisms of action of many chemicals on the endocrine system and on neurodevelopment and behaviour, and to evaluate the effects of doses, time and duration of exposure. Although results are sometimes conflicting because of confounding factors, epidemiological studies in humans suggest effects of EDCs on prenatal growth, thyroid function, glucose metabolism and obesity, puberty, fertility, and on carcinogenesis mainly through epigenetic mechanisms. This manuscript reviews the reports of a multidisciplinary national meeting on this topic.
Inflammation and Neuro-Immune Dysregulations in Autism Spectrum Disorders.Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction and restricted-repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. Strong inflammation states are associated with ASD. This inflammatory condition is often linked to immune system dysfunction. Several cell types are enrolled to trigger and sustain these processes. Neuro-inflammation and neuro-immune abnormalities have now been established in ASD as key factors in its development and maintenance. In this review, we will explore inflammatory conditions, dysfunctions in neuro-immune cross-talk, and immune system treatments in ASD management.
Sleep Disturbances in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Disorders: A Review of the Variability of Objective Sleep Markers.Sleep disturbances are often observed in child and adolescent mental health disorders. Although previous research has identified consistent subjective reports of sleep disturbances, specific objective sleep markers have not yet been identified. We evaluated the current research on subjective and objective sleep markers in relation to attention deficit hyperactivity disorders, autism spectrum disorders, anxiety and depressive disorders. Subjective sleep markers are more consistent than objective markers of actigraphy, polysomnography, and circadian measures. We discuss the causes of variability in objective sleep findings and suggest future directions for research.
A Pilot Investigation of Individual and Dyad Instructional Arrangements.An essential goal for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is to reach maximal independence on a variety of tasks that facilitate academic and vocational engagement and community integration. One-to-one instructional arrangements do not adequately prepare individuals with autism to function within various group contexts and limit opportunities for positive social interactions with one or more peers. Furthermore, group instructional formats have multiple benefits, including potentially increased instructional time and additional learning opportunities. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the acquisition and maintenance of verbal behavior targets in individual and dyad instruction, as well as to compare levels of engagement across these instructional arrangements. Results suggest that three of the four participants acquired more targets during individual instruction, and three of the four participants maintained more targets within individual instruction. In addition, three of the four participants spent less time in instruction and more time on break during dyad instruction. These findings demonstrate the diversity of outcomes for dyad instruction for people with ASD. Directions for future research and suggestions for clinical implementation are provided.
Impact of gut microbiota on neurological diseases: Diet composition and novel treatments.Gut microbiota has significant effects on the structure and function of the enteric and central nervous system including human behaviour and brain regulation. Herein, we analyze the role of this intestinal ecosystem, the effects of dietary changes and the administration of nutritional supplements, such as probiotics, prebiotics, or fecal transplantation in neuropsychiatric disorders. Numerous factors have been highlighted to influence gut microbiota composition, including genetics, health status, mode of birth delivery and environment. However, diet composition and nutritional status has been repeatedly shown to be one of the most critical modifiable factors of this ecosystem. A comprehensively analysis of the microbiome-intestine-brain axis has been performed, including the impact of intestinal bacteria in alterations in the nervous, immune and endocrine systems and their metabolites. Finally, we discuss the latest literature examining the effects of diet composition, nutritional status and microbiota alterations in several neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism, anxiety, depression, Alzheimer's disease and anorexia nervosa.
The Effects of a Shared Reading Intervention on Narrative Story Comprehension and Task Engagement of Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder.The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a shared reading intervention on narrative story comprehension and task engagement of students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A single-case multiple baseline design was used, and three elementary-aged students with ASD participated in this study. The shared reading intervention included before, during, and after reading strategies (i.e., topic anticipation, dynamic reading, story retelling). Results of this study indicated that all participants demonstrated noticeable improvements in reading comprehension. Despite the longer duration of intervention sessions as compared to baseline sessions, participants showed similar or better task engagement with intervention. Improved reading outcomes were maintained at follow up for all participants. Implications for practical implementation and future research were discussed.
Commentary: Measuring Language Change Through Natural Language Samples.The role of language in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), more specifically, its function in social communication and strong predictive power on future outcomes, warrants language assessments that have good psychometric properties that capture the heterogeneity of language ability found among diagnosed individuals. Given the rapid growth in intervention and treatment research, there is an urgent need for the development and implementation of outcome measures that are easily obtained and sensitive to change. In this commentary, we argue for the use of natural language samples as measures of expressive language and communication for this purpose and review the literature on their implementation in ASD research. Conceptual and measurement issues are discussed and future developments are outlined.
Two-Year Follow-up of Isolated Epileptiform Discharges in Autism: An Endophenotypic Biomarker?A significant subset of autistic children exhibit abnormal isolated epileptiform discharges (IEDs) in the absence of clinical epilepsy. The etiological significance of such IEDs is under much debate.
Prospects of Zinc Supplementation in Autism Spectrum Disorders and Shankopathies Such as Phelan McDermid Syndrome.The loss of one copy of SHANK3 (SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 3) in humans highly contributes to Phelan McDermid syndrome (PMDS). In addition, SHANK3 was identified as a major autism candidate gene. Interestingly, the protein encoded by the SHANK3 gene is regulated by zinc. While zinc deficiency depletes synaptic pools of Shank3, increased zinc levels were shown to promote synaptic scaffold formation. Therefore, the hypothesis arises that patients with PMDS and Autism caused by Shankopathies, having one intact copy of SHANK3 left, may benefit from zinc supplementation, as elevated zinc may drive remaining Shank3 into the post-synaptic density (PSD) and may additional recruit Shank2, a second zinc-dependent member of the SHANK gene family. Further, elevated synaptic zinc levels may modulate E/I ratios affecting other synaptic components such as NMDARs. However, several factors need to be considered in relation to zinc supplementation such as the role of Shank3 in the gastrointestinal (GI) system-the location of zinc absorption in humans. Therefore, here, we briefly discuss the prospect and impediments of zinc supplementation in disorders affecting Shank3 such as PMDS and propose a model for most efficacious supplementation.
The Real-Time Comprehension of Idioms by Typical Children, Children with Specific Language Impairment and Children with Autism.We examined on-line auditory idiom comprehension in typically developing (TD) children, children with specific language impairment (SLI), and children with autism. Theories of idiom processing in adults agree on a reliance on lexical/semantic memory for these forms, but differ in their specifics. The Lexical Representation hypothesis claims that literal and non-literal meanings are activated in parallel. The Configuration hypothesis claims that a non-literal meaning will take precedence, such that a literal meaning may not be activated at all.
Genetic testing and autism: Tutorial for communication sciences and disorders.This tutorial provides professionals in communication sciences and disorders with an overview of the molecular basis and parental perceptions of genetic testing as associated with autism. The introduction notes the prominence of genetic testing within present-day medical practices and highlights related limitations and concerns through the lens of disability critique. The body of the tutorial provides an overview of four different forms of genetic variation, highlighting the potential associations with autism and available genetic testing. In sum, most autism cases cannot be associated directly with specified forms of genetic variation but are attributed instead to multiple genetic and environmental influences working in concert. Finally, the discussion focuses on parental perceptions of the genetic testing associated with autism, both the potential benefits and harms, and emphasizes the need to integrate first-person perspectives from autistic individuals.
A systematic review of screening tools in non-young children and adults for autism spectrum disorder.Existing reviews of screening tools for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) focus on young children, and not all screening tools have been examined against validated diagnostic procedures.
Interpersonal motor coordination during joint actions in children with and without autism spectrum disorder: The role of motor information.Kinematics plays a key role in action prediction, imitation and joint action coordination. Despite people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show a failure to use kinematic cues during observation and imitation, there is a paucity of studies exploring the role of this dysfunction during joint actions in children with ASD.
Interoception and Inflammation in Psychiatric Disorders.Despite a historical focus on neurally mediated interoceptive signaling mechanisms, humoral (and even cellular) signals also play an important role in communicating bodily physiological state to the brain. These signaling pathways can perturb neuronal structure, chemistry, and function, leading to discrete changes in behavior. They are also increasingly implicated in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. The importance of these humoral signaling pathways is perhaps most powerfully illustrated in the context of infection and inflammation. Here we provide an overview of how interaction of immune activation of neural and humoral interoceptive mechanisms mediates discrete changes in brain and behavior and highlight how activation of these pathways at specific points in neural development may predispose to psychiatric disorder. As our mechanistic understanding of these interoceptive pathways continues to emerge, it is revealing novel therapeutic targets, potentially heralding an exciting new era of immunotherapies in psychiatry.
Alterations in neuronal cytoskeletal and astrocytic proteins content in the brain of the autistic-like mouse strain C58/J.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopment disorder characterized by deficient social interaction, impaired communication as well as repetitive behaviors. ASD subjects present connectivity and neuroplasticity disturbances associated with morphological alterations in axons, dendrites, and dendritic spines. Given that the neuronal cytoskeleton and astrocytes have an essential role in regulating several mechanisms of neural plasticity, the aim of this work was to study alterations in the content of neuronal cytoskeletal components actin and tubulin and their associated proteins, as well as astrocytic proteins GFAP and TSP-1 in the brain of a C58/J mouse model of ASD. We determined the expression and regulatory phosphorylation state of cytoskeletal components in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum of C58/J mice by means of Western blotting. Our results show that autistic-like mice present: 1) region-dependent altered expression and phosphorylation patterns of Tau isoforms, associated with anomalous microtubule depolymerization; 2) reduced MAP2 A content in prefrontal cortex; 3) region-dependent changes in cofilin expression and phosphorylation, associated with abnormal actin filament depolymerizing dynamics; 4) diminished synaptopodin levels in the hippocampus; and 5) reduced content of the astrocyte-secreted protein TSP-1 in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Our work demonstrates changes in the expression and phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins as well as in TSP-1 in the brain of the autistic-like mice C58/J, shedding light in one of the possible molecular mechanisms underpinning neuroplasticity alterations in the ASD brain and laying the foundation for future investigations in this topic.
Nutritional modulation of the intestinal microbiota; future opportunities for the prevention and treatment of neuroimmune and neuroinflammatory disease.The gut-brain axis refers to the bidirectional communication between the enteric nervous system and the central nervous system. Mounting evidence supports the premise that the intestinal microbiota plays a pivotal role in its function and has led to the more common and perhaps more accurate term gut-microbiota-brain axis. Numerous studies have identified associations between an altered microbiome and neuroimmune and neuroinflammatory diseases. In most cases, it is unknown if these associations are cause or effect; notwithstanding, maintaining or restoring homeostasis of the microbiota may represent future opportunities when treating or preventing these diseases. In recent years, several studies have identified the diet as a primary contributing factor in shaping the composition of the gut microbiota and, in turn, the mucosal and systemic immune systems. In this review, we will discuss the potential opportunities and challenges with respect to modifying and shaping the microbiota through diet and nutrition in order to treat or prevent neuroimmune and neuroinflammatory disease.
Victimization and Perpetration Experiences of Adults With Autism.This study aimed to describe the self-reported experiences of childhood and adult victimization and perpetration in adults with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) compared to a matched sample, and how victimization and perpetration are associated with autism-related difficulties. Forty-five adults with ASC and 42 adults without ASC completed questionnaires regarding violence victimization and perpetration, emotion regulation, and sociocommunicative competence. Participants with ASC reported experiencing, as children, more overall victimization; specifically, more property crime, maltreatment, teasing/emotional bullying, and sexual assault by peers, compared to participants without ASC. Participants with ASC also reported experiencing more teasing/emotional bullying in adulthood and greater sexual contact victimization. No significant differences were found between groups on perpetration. Sociocommunicative ability and emotion regulation deficits did not explain the heightened risk for victimization. Individuals with ASC have an increased vulnerability to violence victimization, which speaks to the need for interventions, and proactive prevention strategies.
Feasibility of a play-based intervention set for toddlers with autism.The Meta-play Method is a play-based, naturalistic set of interventions designed to decrease the symptoms associated with autism in toddlers. The purpose of the present study was to explore the feasibility of using this intervention set with a small group of toddlers and their parents. We selected seven toddlers diagnosed with autism and tested these children for autism severity and severity of repetitive behaviors. Parents were trained on the basic concepts of DBTA and the Meta-play activities. Researchers reviewed the integrity of interventions at once- or twice-monthly home visits for a six-month period, and recorded progress as rated by the parent. Activities were adapted at each visit to the interests and progress of the participating toddler. At the end of six months, autism symptoms and repetitive behavior decreased and parents reported high levels of social validity. Additional aspects of data collection and outcome measures, and suitability of interventions and procedures are discussed. While some outcomes were encouraging, a number of changes are recommended for future research.
Gut Microbiota Regulation of Tryptophan Metabolism in Health and Disease.The gut microbiota is a crucial actor in human physiology. Many of these effects are mediated by metabolites that are either produced by the microbes or derived from the transformation of environmental or host molecules. Among the array of metabolites at the interface between these microorganisms and the host is the essential aromatic amino acid tryptophan (Trp). In the gut, the three major Trp metabolism pathways leading to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), kynurenine (Kyn), and indole derivatives are under the direct or indirect control of the microbiota. In this review, we gather the most recent advances concerning the central role of Trp metabolism in microbiota-host crosstalk in health and disease. Deciphering the complex equilibrium between these pathways will facilitate a better understanding of the pathogenesis of human diseases and open therapeutic opportunities.
Toxic metal(loid)-based pollutants and their possible role in autism spectrum disorder.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social interaction, verbal and non-verbal communication, and stereotypic behaviors. Many studies support a significant relationship between many different environmental factors in ASD etiology. These factors include increased daily exposure to various toxic metal-based environmental pollutants, which represent a cause for concern in public health. This article reviews the most relevant toxic metals, commonly found, environmental pollutants, i.e., lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), aluminum (Al), and the metalloid arsenic (As). Additionally, it discusses how pollutants can be a possible pathogenetic cause of ASD through various mechanisms including neuroinflammation in different regions of the brain, fundamentally occurring through elevation of the proinflammatory profile of cytokines and aberrant expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). Due to the worldwide increase in toxic environmental pollution, studies on the role of pollutants in neurodevelopmental disorders, including direct effects on the developing brain and the subjects' genetic susceptibility and polymorphism, are of utmost importance to achieve the best therapeutic approach and preventive strategies.
Genomics of autism spectrum disorder: approach to therapy.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly prevalent neurodevelopmental condition with no current treatment available. Although advances in genetics and genomics have identified hundreds of genes associated with ASD, very little is known about the pathophysiology of ASD and the functional contribution of specific genes to ASD phenotypes. Improved understanding of the biological function of ASD-associated genes and how this heterogeneous group of genetic variants leads to the disease is needed in order to develop therapeutic strategies. Here, we review the current state of ASD research related to gene discovery and examples of emerging molecular mechanisms (protein translation and alternative splicing). In addition, we discuss how patient-derived three-dimensional brain organoids might provide an opportunity to model specific genetic variants in order to define molecular and cellular defects that could be amenable for developing and screening personalized therapies related to ASD.
Data on social transmission of food preference in a model of autism induced by valproic acid and translational analysis of circulating microRNA.This article contains data of Social Transmission of Food Preference in an animal model of autism and the evaluation of a set of microRNA analyzed in autistic patients and animal model of autism. The analyses of the absolute consumption of two flavored food by male rats prenatally exposed to valproic acid (VPA) and treated with resveratrol (RSV), showed that VPA animals show a trend to eat less of the flavored food presented by a demonstrator rat. We also identified 13 microRNA with similar levels among rodents' experimental groups, as well as 11 microRNA with no alterations between autistic and control subjects. Further evaluation of mechanisms of VPA and RSV actions on behavioral and molecular alterations can shed light in important biomarkers and etiological triggers of autistic spectrum disorders.
Systematic review and guide to management of core and psychiatric symptoms in youth with autism.Evidence-based guidance of clinical decision-making for the management of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is lacking, particularly for co-occurring psychiatric symptoms. This review evaluates treatment evidence for six common symptom targets in children/adolescents with ASD and provides a resource to facilitate application of the evidence to clinical practice.
An experimental demonstration of AAB renewal in children with autism spectrum disorder.Operant renewal is a return of extinguished behavior due to changes in contextual stimuli that control the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a response. Well-established in classical conditioning and operant research, renewal presents itself in three forms-ABA, ABC, and AAB-and poses threats to treatment maintenance where extinction procedures are utilized. As AAB renewal may be less likely to occur than ABA or ABC renewal, the current study sought to determine if AAB renewal would occur with three participants with Autism Spectrum Disorder who were taught a simple lever pull response. Results showed that lever pulls increased for two of three participants when we introduced novel stimuli (i.e., a light and a buzzer) to alter the contextual environment after extinction. These findings suggest that AAB renewal may account for some instances of response recovery after extinction and that the procedure of this study may be beneficial to the further study of renewal and the variables that affect its occurrence within a translational model.
Observational learning and children with autism: discrimination training of known and unknown stimuli.We extended past observational learning research by incorporating stimuli already known to participants into training. We used a multiple-baseline design across three participants to determine the effects of discrimination training on the discrimination of consequences applied to modeled responses using both known and unknown pictures. During baseline, participants were exposed to modeled correct and incorrect picture labels and were observed to imitate modeled responses that were incorrect and followed by negative feedback. During discrimination training, we taught participants to label known pictures regardless of observed responses and consequences. With unknown pictures, we taught participants to imitate correct and reinforced modeled responses, and to say, "I don't know," when modeled responses were incorrect and received negative feedback. Test sessions measured responding to known and unknown pictures and showed acquisition over baseline levels. Generalization to pictures not associated with training was variable. Implications for teaching observational learning to children with autism are discussed.
Effects of reinforcement without extinction on increasing compliance with nail cutting: A systematic replication.Personal hygiene routines, such as nail cutting, are essential for maintaining good health. However, individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other developmental disabilities often struggle to comply with essential, personal hygiene routines. We conducted a systematic replication of Schumacher and Rapp (2011), Shabani and Fisher (2006), and Bishop et al. (2013) to evaluate an intervention that did not require escape extinction for increasing compliance with nail cutting. With two adolescents diagnosed with ASD who resisted nail cutting, we evaluated the effects of delivering a preferred edible item contingent on compliance with nail cutting. Results indicated that the treatment reduced participants' escape responses and increased their compliance with nail cutting.
Being vs. Appearing Socially Uninterested: Challenging Assumptions about Social Motivation in Autism.Progress in psychological science can be limited by a number of factors, not least of which are the starting assumptions of scientists themselves. We believe that some influential accounts of autism rest on a questionable assumption that many of its behavioral characteristics indicate a lack of social interest-an assumption that is flatly contradicted by the testimony of many autistic people themselves. In this paper, we challenge this assumption by describing alternative explanations for four such behaviors: (a) low levels of eye contact, (b) infrequent pointing, (c) motor stereotypies, and (d) echolalia. The assumption that autistic people's unusual behaviors indicate diminished social motivation has had profound and often negative effects on the ways they are studied and treated. We argue that understanding and supporting autistic individuals will require interrogating this assumption, taking autistic testimony seriously, considering alternative explanations for unusual behaviors, and investigating unconventional-even idiosyncratic-ways that autistic individuals may express their social interest. These steps are crucial, we believe, for creating a more accurate, humane, and useful science of autism.
Coping strategies of parents of children with autism spectrum disorder: a systematic review.To deal with stress, parents of children with ASD use coping strategies that help to tackle the challenging situations of raising their child. This systematic review examines parental coping strategy's questionnaires, factors which influence these coping strategies, interactions between these strategies and perceived stress and their impact on parental quality of life. According to PRISMA guidelines, an electronic search was conducted on Medline, PsycInfo and Eric: 156 articles were identified and 11 studies were selected. Many types of self-reported questionnaires were used to assess parental coping strategies. Studies highlighted that parents of a child with ASD used more avoidance strategies and less social support-seeking strategies than those of typical children. Furthermore, problem-focused coping protects parental stress and quality of life, that on the contrary, emotion-focused coping is a risk factor for alteration. Our systematic review illustrates the need to adapt psychoeducational interventions for parents of children with ASD.
Toward a Phenomenological Account of Embodied Subjectivity in Autism.Sensorimotor research is currently challenging the dominant understanding of autism as a deficit in the cognitive ability to 'mindread'. This marks an emerging shift in autism research from a focus on the structure and processes of the mind to a focus on autistic behavior as grounded in the body. Contemporary researchers in sensorimotor differences in autism call for a reconciliation between the scientific understanding of autism and the first-person experience of autistic individuals. I argue that fulfilling this ambition requires a phenomenological understanding of the body as it presents itself in ordinary experience, namely as the subject of experience rather than a physical object. On this basis, I investigate how the phenomenology of Maurice Merleau-Ponty can be employed as a frame of understanding for bodily experience in autism. Through a phenomenological analysis of Tito Mukhopadhyay's autobiographical work, How can I talk if my lips don't move (2009), I illustrate the relevance and potential of phenomenological philosophy in autism research, arguing that this approach enables a deeper understanding of bodily and subjective experiences related to autism.
Dual Requirement of CHD8 for Chromatin Landscape Establishment and Histone Methyltransferase Recruitment to Promote CNS Myelination and Repair.Disruptive mutations in chromatin remodeler CHD8 cause autism spectrum disorders, exhibiting widespread white matter abnormalities; however, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We show that cell-type specific Chd8 deletion in oligodendrocyte progenitors, but not in neurons, results in myelination defects, revealing a cell-intrinsic dependence on CHD8 for oligodendrocyte lineage development, myelination and post-injury remyelination. CHD8 activates expression of BRG1-associated SWI/SNF complexes that in turn activate CHD7, thus initiating a successive chromatin remodeling cascade that orchestrates oligodendrocyte lineage progression. Genomic occupancy analyses reveal that CHD8 establishes an accessible chromatin landscape, and recruits MLL/KMT2 histone methyltransferase complexes distinctively around proximal promoters to promote oligodendrocyte differentiation. Inhibition of histone demethylase activity partially rescues myelination defects of CHD8-deficient mutants. Our data indicate that CHD8 exhibits a dual function through inducing a cascade of chromatin reprogramming and recruiting H3K4 histone methyltransferases to establish oligodendrocyte identity, suggesting potential strategies of therapeutic intervention for CHD8-associated white matter defects.
Variable behavior and repeated learning in two mouse strains: Developmental and genetic contributions.Behavioral inflexibility is often assessed using reversal learning tasks, which require a relatively low degree of response variability. No studies have assessed sensitivity to reinforcement contingencies that specifically select highly variable response patterns in mice, let alone in models of neurodevelopmental disorders involving limited response variation. Operant variability and incremental repeated acquisition (IRA) were used to assess unique aspects of behavioral variability of two mouse strains: BALB/c, a model of some deficits in ASD, and C57Bl/6. On the operant variability task, BALB/c mice responded more repetitively during adolescence than C57Bl/6 mice when reinforcement did not require variability but responded more variably when reinforcement required variability. During IRA testing in adulthood, both strains acquired an unchanging, performance sequence equally well. Strain differences emerged, however, after novel learning sequences began alternating with the performance sequence: BALB/c mice substantially outperformed C57Bl/6 mice. Using litter-mate controls, it was found that adolescent experience with variability did not affect either learning or performance on the IRA task in adulthood. These findings constrain the use of BALB/c mice as a model of ASD, but once again reveal this strain is highly sensitive to reinforcement contingencies and they are fast and robust learners.
Balance Performance in Autism: A Brief Overview.Children with autism not only have limited social and communicative skills but also have motor abnormalities, such as poor timing and coordination of balance. Moreover, impaired gross motor skills hamper participation with peers. Balance control is interesting from a cognitive science perspective, since it involves a complex interplay between information processing, motor planning, and timing and sequencing of muscle movements. In this paper, we discuss the background of motor problems in children with autism, focusing on how posture is informed by sensory information processing. We also discuss the neurobiological basis of balance problems, and how this is related to anxiety in this group. We then discuss possible avenues for treatment of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms, especially as regards movement-related interventions. Finally, we present a theoretical outlook and discuss whether some of the symptoms in ASD can be understood from an embodied cognition perspective.
Discrimination and Generalization of Negatively-Reinforced Mands in Young Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder.In this study, we extended the literature on the generalization of negatively-reinforced mands in three young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). First, we used example and nonexample stimuli embedded in mand training to teach a new, socially appropriate, negatively-reinforced mand to reject unpreferred food items while continuously assessing mand discrimination. Second, we evaluated the discriminated generalization of the newly acquired mand by using untrained example and nonexample stimuli. Finally, we conducted maintenance probes to examine if the new, discriminated mand occurred over time in the absence of training. Results suggest that our mand training produced acquisition of a discriminated negatively-reinforced mand in all three children. Data indicate that the newly acquired, discriminated mand generalized to untrained food items and was maintained after training was discontinued. We discuss the conceptual significance and clinical implications of using example and nonexample stimuli to produce acquisition, generalization, and maintenance of negatively-reinforced mands in young children with ASD and language delays.
Outcomes of a Behavioral Intervention for Sleep Disturbances in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.This study evaluated the effectiveness of Bedtime Fading with Response Cost (BFRC) in decreasing sleep disturbances in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using parents as change agents by implementing treatment in the home environment. A non-concurrent multiple baseline design across three participants was used. Results indicate that BFRC was effective in eliminating unwanted co-sleeping, frequent night awakenings, and dependent sleep onset. Secondary improvements include reducing sleep onset latency, bedtime resistance, and disruptive sleep-related behaviors. Follow-up data demonstrate gains were maintained. Parents reported high satisfaction with BFRC and sleep outcomes for their children. This study extends both the practice and science of parent-implemented behavioral interventions as treatment options for children with ASD and co-occurring sleep disturbances.
Metabolism-Associated Markers and Childhood Autism Rating Scales (CARS) as a Measure of Autism Severity.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neuro-behavioral syndrome with a broad spectrum of different mechanisms and etiologies that are caused by abnormal brain development. To date, no highly reliable and effective diagnostic biomarker to assess ASD is available so far. The present study investigated the predictivity potential of some suggested markers in ASD diagnosis focusing onto the relative ratios of several plasma biomarkers of electron transport chain function, and mitochondrial metabolism in 41 patients with ASD evaluated for behavior deficits measured using Childhood Autism Rating Scales (CARS). The control matched for further 41 healthy subjects. The relation of these relative ratios to ASD severity was also examined, as well as their ability to distinguish ASD children from neurotypical children. All predictive ratios were found to be markedly altered and correlated in ASD patients. However, no ratio was connected with autism severity. Interestingly, MRCC-I/caspase-7, GSH/GST, and MRCC-I/COQ10 were the most distinctive relative ratios between neurotypical controls and ASD patients and may thereby be useful biomarkers for early diagnosis of ASD. Overall, this investigation proves that relative ratios of numerous mitochondrial biomarkers might be predictive and efficient to differentiate between neurotypical children and ASD.
Autism throughout genetics: Perusal of the implication of ion channels.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) comprises a group of neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders characterized by deficits in social interactions, interpersonal communication, repetitive and stereotyped behaviors and may be associated with intellectual disabilities. The description of ASD as a synaptopathology highlights the importance of the synapse and the implication of ion channels in the etiology of these disorders.
Social approach, anxiety, and altered tryptophan hydroxylase 2 activity in juvenile BALB/c and C57BL/6J mice.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous and highly heritable condition with multiple aetiologies. Although the biological mechanisms underlying ASD are not fully understood, evidence suggests that dysregulation of serotonergic systems play an important role in ASD psychopathology. Preclinical models using mice with altered serotonergic neurotransmission may provide insight into the role of serotonin in behaviours relevant to clinical features of ASD. For example, BALB/c mice carry a loss-of-function single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; C1473 G) in tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (Tph2), which encodes the brain-specific isoform of the rate-limiting enzyme for serotonin synthesis, and these mice frequently have been used to model symptoms of ASD. In this study, juvenile male BALB/c (G/G; loss-of-function variant) and C57BL/6 J (C/C; wild type variant) mice, were exposed to the three-chamber sociability test, and one week later to the elevated plus-maze (EPM). Tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) activity was measured following injection of the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC)-inhibitor, NSD-1015, and subsequent HPLC detection of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) within subregions of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) and median raphe nucleus (MnR). The BALB/c mice showed reduced social behaviour and increased anxious behaviour, as well as decreased 5-HTP accumulation in the rostral and mid-rostrocaudal DR. In the full cohort of mice, TPH2 activity in the mid-rostrocaudal DR was correlated with anxious behaviour in the EPM, however these correlations were not statistically significant within each strain, suggesting that TPH2 activity was not directly associated with either anxiety or sociability. Further research is therefore required to more fully understand how serotonergic systems are involved in mouse behaviours that resemble some of the clinical features of ASD.
Increased expression of BDNF mRNA in the frontal cortex of autistic patients.Autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs) are neurodevelopmental disorders for which genetic components have been well defined. However, specific gene deregulations related to synapse function in the autistic brain have not been as extensively described. Based on a candidate genes approach, we present in this study the expression data of 4 transcripts of interest (BDNF, CAMK2a, NR-CAM and RIMS1) located at the synapse in two regions of interest in the context of the ASDs; the lobule VI of cerebellum and the Brodmann area 46. We have also genotyped in our cohort the coding single nucleotide polymorphism rs6265, located in the BDNF gene. After correction for age and sex, whereas no change was observed in the lobule VI between controls and autistic patients, we found a significant increase of BDNF expression level in the BA46 from autistic patients. No significant interaction between the rs6265 genotype and autism was observed for the BDNF expression. However, "A" allele carriers are more likely to have increased BDNF levels. Finally, we found a significant positive correlation between BDNF and RIMS1 expression levels. Our data suggest that these two molecules which are involved in cell signalling at the synapse, might have coordinated expressions and, that BDNF regulation in the brain has to be investigated further in the context of ASDs.
Interventionist Acquisition of Incidental Teaching Using Pyramidal Training via Telehealth.We investigated the effects of a telehealth pyramidal training package on participants' implementation of incidental teaching. A total of eight adults worked with eight children with autism. Coaches were first taught to implement incidental teaching and then taught subsequent interventionists. The training package consisted of an online module and delayed video-based feedback provided via videoconferencing. Following the telehealth training program, coaches and interventionists reached the preset performance criteria and implemented incidental teaching with high fidelity. All of the child participants increased mands above baseline levels. Results suggest that interventionists can be trained via telehealth in behavior analytic interventions.
Exposure to Acute and Chronic Fluoxetine has Differential Effects on Sociability and Activity of Serotonergic Neurons in the Dorsal Raphe Nucleus of Juvenile Male BALB/c Mice.Although the neurobiological mechanisms underlying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are still unknown, dysregulation of serotonergic systems has been implicated in the etiology of ASD, and serotonergic antidepressant drugs are often prescribed to treat some symptoms of ASD. The BALB/c strain of mice express a dysregulated serotonergic system and a phenotype that is relevant to ASD. In this study, juvenile male BALB/c mice were exposed to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine either chronically (18 mg/kg/day in drinking water, post-natal day (PND) 28-39) or acutely (18 mg/kg, i.p.; PND40), or to vehicle control conditions (0.9% sterile saline, i.p.; PND40), prior to being exposed to the three-chambered sociability test (SAT; PND40). One cohort of mice then received an injection of the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD-1015, and one hour later brain tissue was collected for quantification of 5-hydroxytryptophan accumulation in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) as a measure of TPH2 activity. For the second cohort, brain tissue was collected ninety minutes after the onset of the social phase of the SAT and prepared for immunohistochemical staining for c-Fos and TPH2 to measure the activation of serotonergic neurons within subregions of the DR. Acute fluoxetine decreased social behavior, while chronic fluoxetine increased social behavior compared with vehicle-treated controls. Furthermore, acute and chronic fluoxetine treatments were without effect on TPH2 activity but differentially affected populations of serotonergic neurons in the DR. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that serotonergic systems are implicated in social behavior that is relevant for ASD.
Brief Report: A Gaming Approach to the Assessment of Attention Networks in Autism Spectrum Disorder and Typical Development.Attentional impairments are among the earliest identifiable features of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Three attention networks have been extensively studied using the attention network test (ANT), but this long and repetitive task may pose challenges for individuals with ASDs. The AttentionTrip was developed as a more engaging measure of attention network efficiency. In 20 adults with ASDs and 20 typically developing controls, both tasks produced typical network scores (all p < .003, all Cohen's d > 0.78). Reaction time was less variable in the AttentionTrip than the ANT, possibly reflecting improved task engagement. Although the AttentionTrip elicited more consistent responses throughout an experimental session, anomalously low split-half reliability for its executive control network suggests that some changes may be needed.
Autism Diagnosis in the United Kingdom: Perspectives of Autistic Adults, Parents and Professionals.Accessing an autism diagnosis is a key milestone, both for an individual and their family. Using a qualitative methodology, the current study examined the views and experiences of ten autistic adults, ten parents of children on the autism spectrum, and ten professionals involved in autism diagnosis, all based in the United Kingdom (UK). Interviewing these 30 respondents about the diagnostic process and subsequent support options, the goal was to identify aspects of the diagnostic process that are working well, and areas in which improvements are needed. Using thematic analysis, three key themes were identified: the process of understanding and accepting autism; multiple barriers to satisfaction with the diagnostic process; and inadequate post-diagnostic support provision.
Brief Report: A Survey of Autism Research Priorities Across a Diverse Community of Stakeholders.Inclusion of stakeholder voices in the allocation of research funding can increase the relevance of results and improve community engagement in research. We describe the results of an online survey that gathered input from community stakeholders regarding autism research priorities. A demographically diverse sample of respondents (N = 6004; 79.1% female; 72.5% ages 30-59; 86.4% USA) completed the survey. Results indicated a preference for applied relative to basic science topics, though both basic and applied science areas were rated as important. Respondents gave their highest ratings to research focused on co-occurring conditions, health and well-being, adult transition, and lifespan issues. These results can guide decision-making by public and private funders when developing science funding priorities and engaging in science dissemination activities.
Increased Grik4 Gene Dosage Causes Imbalanced Circuit Output and Human Disease-Related Behaviors.Altered glutamatergic neurotransmission is thought to contribute to mental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Copy-number variation in genes associated with glutamatergic synapses represents a source of genetic variability, possibly underlying neurological and mental disease susceptibility. The GRIK4 gene encodes a high-affinity kainate receptor subunit of essentially unknown function, although de novo duplication of the 11q23.3-q24.1 locus to which it maps has been detected in autism and other disorders. To determine how changes in the dose of Grik4 affect synaptic activity, we studied mice overexpressing this gene in the forebrain. A mild gain in Grik4 enhances synaptic transmission, causing a persistent imbalance in inhibitory and excitatory activity and disturbing the circuits responsible for the main amygdala outputs. These changes in glutamatergic activity reverse when Grik4 levels are normalized; thus, they may account for the behavioral abnormalities in disorders like autism or schizophrenia.
NGL-2 Deletion Leads to Autistic-like Behaviors Responsive to NMDAR Modulation.Netrin-G ligand 2 (NGL-2)/LRRC4, implicated in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, is a leucine-rich repeat-containing postsynaptic adhesion molecule that interacts intracellularly with the excitatory postsynaptic scaffolding protein PSD-95 and trans-synaptically with the presynaptic adhesion molecule netrin-G2. Functionally, NGL-2 regulates excitatory synapse development and synaptic transmission. However, whether it regulates synaptic plasticity and disease-related specific behaviors is not known. Here, we report that mice lacking NGL-2 (Lrrc4
Pitch direction ability predicts melodic perception in autism.Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) often present atypical auditory perception. Previous work has reported both enhanced low-level pitch discrimination and superior abilities to detect local pitch structure on higher-level melodic tasks in ASD. However, it is unclear how low and high levels of auditory perception are related in ASD or typical development (TD), or how this relationship might change across development and stimulus presentation rates. To these aims, in the present study, children with ASD and TD were tested on a low-level pitch direction discrimination task and a high-level melodic global-local task. Groups performed similarly on both of these auditory tasks. Moreover, individual differences in low-level pitch direction ability predicted performance on the higher-level global-local task, with a stronger relationship in ASD. Age did not affect the relationship between low-level and high-level pitch performance in either ASD or TD. However, there was a more positive effect of age on the high-level global-local task performance in TD than ASD. Finally, there was no effect of stimulus rate on the relationship between low-level and high-level pitch performance in either group. These findings provide a better understanding of how perception is associated across levels of processing in ASD versus TD. This work helps to better understand individual differences in auditory perception and to refine ASD phenotypes.
Engaging with and navigating limbo: Lived experiences of siblings of adults with autism spectrum disorders.Supporting an adult with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be associated with family stress but also with personal growth and resilience. Research providing insight into how typically developing siblings make sense of their unique sibling relationships in adulthood remains limited.
Autism and heritable bone fragility: A true association?Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a heterogeneous condition mainly characterised by bone fragility; intelligence is reported to be normal. However, a minority of children seen also show symptomology consistent with an 'Autism Spectrum Disorder'. A joint genetics and psychology research study was undertaken to identify these patients using 'Gold Standard' research tools: Autism Diagnostic Inventory Revised (ADI-R); Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and undertake genetic analyses in them.
Failure to Replicate the Effects of the High-Probability Instructional Sequence on Feeding in Children With Autism and Food Selectivity.Behavioral intervention has positive effects on feeding problems of children with autism and food selectivity (FS), and researchers have evaluated a variety of specific behavioral interventions. Confidence in the effects of some specific interventions on feeding such as the high-probability instructional sequence (HPS) is limited by a lack of replication. Therefore, we assessed the generality of the HPS by replicating the intervention in children with autism and FS. Contrary to prior research, the HPS did not improve feeding responses for three consecutive children enrolled in the study. We discuss the results in relation to publishing failures to replicate without experimental control in applied behavior analysis research.
Social behaviour and social cognition in high-functioning adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD): two sides of the same coin?Of the triad of symptoms found in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), that is, social impairments, communication difficulties and repetitive interests and behaviour, the social impairments are the most stable and common throughout the lifespan. They typically manifest themselves in abnormalities as reciprocal interactions and difficulties in the expression and recognition of emotions. Although peer interactions become especially important during adolescence, little is known about the mentalizing abilities of high-functioning adolescents with ASD. Here, we compared the mentalizing skills and emotion recognition abilities of 21 high-functioning adolescents with ASD and 21 matched controls. All adolescents had estimated above-average verbal intelligence levels. Spontaneous social abilities and task-related social abilities were measured using questionnaires, tasks and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. Results confirm social impairment in daily life situations in adolescents with ASD, but were not found on experimental tasks of social cognition. The use of more explicit cognitive or verbally mediating reasoning techniques and a lesser tendency of high-functioning adolescents with ASD to search for and use social information in natural environments are further discussed.
De Novo Truncating Mutations in WASF1 Cause Intellectual Disability with Seizures.Next-generation sequencing has been invaluable in the elucidation of the genetic etiology of many subtypes of intellectual disability in recent years. Here, using exome sequencing and whole-genome sequencing, we identified three de novo truncating mutations in WAS protein family member 1 (WASF1) in five unrelated individuals with moderate to profound intellectual disability with autistic features and seizures. WASF1, also known as WAVE1, is part of the WAVE complex and acts as a mediator between Rac-GTPase and actin to induce actin polymerization. The three mutations connected by Matchmaker Exchange were c.1516C>T (p.Arg506Ter), which occurs in three unrelated individuals, c.1558C>T (p.Gln520Ter), and c.1482delinsGCCAGG (p.Ile494MetfsTer23). All three variants are predicted to partially or fully disrupt the C-terminal actin-binding WCA domain. Functional studies using fibroblast cells from two affected individuals with the c.1516C>T mutation showed a truncated WASF1 and a defect in actin remodeling. This study provides evidence that de novo heterozygous mutations in WASF1 cause a rare form of intellectual disability.
A Computational Study of Expressive Facial Dynamics in Children with Autism.Several studies have established that facial expressions of children with autism are often perceived as atypical, awkward or less engaging by typical adult observers. Despite this clear deficit in the quality of facial expression production, very little is understood about its underlying mechanisms and characteristics. This paper takes a computational approach to studying details of facial expressions of children with high functioning autism (HFA). The objective is to uncover those characteristics of facial expressions, notably distinct from those in typically developing children, and which are otherwise difficult to detect by visual inspection. We use motion capture data obtained from subjects with HFA and typically developing subjects while they produced various facial expressions. This data is analyzed to investigate how the overall and local facial dynamics of children with HFA differ from their typically developing peers. Our major observations include reduced complexity in the dynamic facial behavior of the HFA group arising primarily from the eye region.
Hesperetin and it nanocrystals ameliorate social behavior deficits and oxido-inflammatory stress in rat model of autism.Prenatal exposure to valproic acid (VPA) induces behavioral disorders and enhancement of oxido-inflammatory stress in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs). The aim of this study was to investigate the comparative effects of hesperetin (Hst) and nano-hesperetin on social behavior deficits and oxido-inflammatory indexes in prenatally valproic acid-exposed rat offspring. Pregnant Wistar rats on embryonic day 0 (E0) were segregated into six groups; Group-1 served as vehicle, received distillated water orally (PO) from E1 until the end of lactation and saline intraperitoneally (i.p) on E12.5. Group-2 received sodium valproate (500 mg/kg in 0.9% saline, i.p) on E12.5 was considered as VPA-exposed group, Group-3 to 6 were VPA-exposed which received hesperetin and nano-hesperetin (10 and 20 mg/kg/day, PO) from E0 until the end of lactation respectively. Social interaction and open field tests were conducted on postnatal day 28 (PND 28) and PND 30, cerebral antioxidant enzymes activity and biochemical indexes, the level of inflammatory factors in plasma and histopathology of cerebellum were estimated on PND 28 and PND 30. Prenatal valproic acid-exposed rat exhibited poor sociability and high level of anxiety-like behaviors (P <  0.05). In addition, increased level of oxidative stress and inflammation were found by determining different oxido-inflammatory markers. Hesperetin and nano-hesperetin treatment improved the behavioral disorder and reduced the oxidative stress in brain and significantly (p <  0.05) plasma's inflammation indexes. In conclusion, it can be state that nano-hesperetin exerts neuroprotective action in comparison with hesperetin and could be efficacious for treatment of VPA animal model of autism during pregnancy and lactation.
Neuropsychiatric Aspects in Men with Klinefelter Syndrome.Klinefelter Syndrome (KS) is the most common sex chromosome aneuploidy (47,XXY) and cause of male hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. It is characterized by an extreme clinical heterogeneity in presentation, including infertility, hypogonadism, language delay, metabolic comorbidities, and neurocognitive and psychiatric disorders. Since testosterone is known to have organizational, neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects on brain, the condition of primary hypogonadism could play a role. Moreover, given that KS subjects have an additional X, genes on the extra-chromosome could also exert a significant impact. The aim of this narrative review is to analyze the available literature on the relationship between KS and neuropsychiatric disorders.
Influence of Community-Level Cultural Beliefs about Autism on Families' and Professionals' Care for Children.This qualitative study aimed to understand how community-level cultural beliefs affect families' and professionals' care for children with autism and developmental delays in immigrant communities, as a first step towards promoting early identification and access to early intervention services. The study was part of the larger New York City (NYC) Korean Community Autism Project, which was designed to identify strategies to increase awareness of autism and reduce delays in treatment seeking within the NYC Korean-American community. Our study elicited early childcare workers' and church leaders' beliefs about autism and developmental disorders and, in particular, early intervention. We also elicited responses to newly developed outreach materials targeting this community. An inductive approach was used to identify concepts and categories associated with autism. Our study confirmed that discomfort, stigma and discrimination are the prevailing community attitudes toward autism and developmental disorders in the Korean-American community. Families' and professionals' understanding of autism and their care for children are affected by these community beliefs. Approaching immigrant communities with general information about child development and education rather than directly talking about autism and developmental disorders is likely to engage more families and professionals in need for diagnostic evaluation and early intervention for autism.
Presentation and Correlates of Hoarding Behaviors in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders and Comorbid Anxiety or Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms.We investigated the presentation and correlates of hoarding behaviors in 204 children aged 7-13 with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and comorbid anxiety or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms. Approximately 34% of the sample presented at least moderate levels, and with 7% presenting severe to extreme levels of hoarding. Child gender predicted hoarding severity. In addition, child ASD-related social difficulties together with attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder symptom severity positively predicted hoarding controlling for child gender and restricted and repetitive behaviors. Finally, child anxiety/OCD symptoms positively predicted hoarding, controlling for all other factors. These results suggest hoarding behaviors may constitute a common feature of pediatric ASD with comorbid anxiety/OCD, particularly in girls and children with greater social difficulties and comorbid psychiatric symptom severity.
The neurobiology of interoception in health and disease.Interoception is the sensing of internal bodily sensations. Interoception is an umbrella term that encompasses (1) the afferent (body-to-brain) signaling through distinct neural and humoral (including immune and endocrine) channels; (2) the neural encoding, representation, and integration of this information concerning internal bodily state; (3) the influence of such information on other perceptions, cognitions, and behaviors; (4) and the psychological expression of these representations as consciously accessible physical sensations and feelings. Interoceptive mechanisms ensure physiological health through the cerebral coordination of homeostatic reflexes and allostatic responses that include motivational behaviors and associated affective and emotional feelings. Furthermore, the conscious, unitary sense of self in time and space may be grounded in the primacy and lifelong continuity of interoception. Body-to-brain interactions influence physical and mental well-being. Consequently, we show that systematic investigation of how individual differences, and within-individual changes, in interoceptive processing can contribute to the mechanistic understanding of physical and psychological disorders. We present a neurobiological overview of interoception and describe how interoceptive impairments at different levels relate to specific physical and mental health conditions, including sickness behaviors and fatigue, depression, eating disorders, autism, and anxiety. We frame these findings in an interoceptive predictive processing framework and highlight potential new avenues for treatments.
Prenatal exposure to environmental insults and enhanced risk of developing Schizophrenia and Autism Spectrum Disorder: focus on biological pathways and epigenetic mechanisms.When considering neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), Schizophrenia (SZ) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are considered to be among the most severe in term of prevalence, morbidity and impact on the society. Similar features and overlapping symptoms have been observed at multiple levels, suggesting common pathophysiological bases. Indeed, recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and epidemiological data report shared vulnerability genes and environmental triggers across the two disorders. In this review, we will discuss the possible biological mechanisms, including glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmissions, inflammatory signals and oxidative stress related systems, which are targeted by adverse environmental exposures and that have been associated with the development of SZ and ASD. We will also discuss the emerging role of the gut microbiome as possible interplay between environment, immune system and brain development. Finally, we will describe the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in the maintenance of long-lasting effects of adverse environments early in life. This will allow us to better understand the pathophysiology of these NDDs, and also to identify novel targets for future treatment strategies.
"Life is Much More Difficult to Manage During Periods": Autistic Experiences of Menstruation.Although menarche and menstruation are perceived to be overwhelmingly negative events for developmentally-disabled women, women's health issues remain under-researched in autism. Here, we conducted a preliminary investigation of the experiences of post-menarcheal autistic (n = 123) and non-autistic (n = 114) respondents to a brief online survey. Although autistic respondents reported many overlapping issues and experiences with non-autistic respondents, they also highlighted distinct-and sometimes-distressing-issues relating to menstruation, especially a cyclical amplification of autistic-related challenges, including sensory differences and difficulties with regulating emotion and behavior, which had a significant, negative impact on their lives. These initial findings call for systematic research on the potential causes, correlates and consequences of menstrual-related problems in autistic individuals-across the spectrum and the lifespan.
Understanding Friendship Sex Heterophily and Relational Characteristics to Optimize the Selection of Peer Models for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.This study used social network analysis to evaluate whether sex heterophily, the degree to which peers are different in sex, between 126 children with autism (ages 5-12 years) and their peers affected social network connectivity. Results indicate that: (1) the quantity and sex of friends were more important in predicting social network connectivity than the relational characteristics of the friends (friendship nominations and social network salience/popularity); and (2) sex heterophily is an important factor in predicting social network connectivity. For males with autism, having friends of the same sex was associated with better social network connectivity; this was not true for females with autism. These findings have important implications for the selection of peer models for elementary-aged children with autism.
Associations between Diet, Dietary and Oral Hygiene Habits with Caries Occurrence and Severity in Children with Autism at Dammam City, Saudi Arabia.The purpose of the study is to achieve the baseline information of the autistic child's oral health status about the diet, dietary and hygiene habits. The association of these factors with dental caries were assessed.
Overview of the Recent Advances in Pathophysiology and Treatment for Autism.Autism is a developmental disorder that manifests itself in early childhood. Autism is characterized by inability to acquire social skills, repetitive behaviors and failure of speech and nonverbal communication development. Recent studies have shown that genetic mutations occur in majority of individuals with autism. These mutations cause a variety of disorders that ultimately lead to brain disorders. It is noteworthy that all mutations do not follow the same pattern. They encompass various kinds of mutations. Autism needs to be treated during childhood as untreated patients usually do not progress to the later stages of development. In this regard, many studies have been performed and numerous treatments have been proposed to improve the outcome of this disease.
Psychiatric Comorbidity in Children and Adults with Gluten-Related Disorders: A Narrative Review.Gluten-related disorders are characterized by both intestinal and extraintestinal manifestations. Previous studies have suggested an association between gluten-related disorder and psychiatric comorbidities. The objective of our current review is to provide a comprehensive review of this association in children and adults. A systematic literature search using MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO from inception to 2018 using terms of &lsquo;celiac disease&rsquo; or &lsquo;gluten-sensitivity-related disorders&rsquo; combined with terms of &lsquo;mental disorders&rsquo; was conducted. A total of 47 articles were included in our review, of which 28 studies were conducted in adults, 11 studies in children and eight studies included both children and adults. The majority of studies were conducted in celiac disease, two studies in non-celiac gluten sensitivity and none in wheat allergy. Enough evidence is currently available supporting the association of celiac disease with depression and, to a lesser extent, with eating disorders. Further investigation is warranted to evaluate the association suggested with other psychiatric disorders. In conclusion, routine surveillance of potential psychiatric manifestations in children and adults with gluten-related disorders should be carried out by the attending physician.
Exploring the neurocognitive basis of episodic recollection in autism.Increasing evidence indicates that the subjective experience of recollection is diminished in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared to neurotypical individuals. The neurocognitive basis of this difference in how past events are re-experienced has been debated and various theoretical accounts have been proposed to date. Although each existing theory may capture particular features of memory in ASD, recent research questions whether any of these explanations are alone sufficient or indeed fully supported. This review first briefly considers the cognitive neuroscience of how episodic recollection operates in the neurotypical population, informing predictions about the encoding and retrieval mechanisms that might function atypically in ASD. We then review existing research on recollection in ASD, which has often not distinguished between different theoretical explanations. Recent evidence suggests a distinct difficulty engaging recollective retrieval processes, specifically the ability to consciously reconstruct and monitor a past experience, which is likely underpinned by altered functional interactions between neurocognitive systems rather than brain region-specific or process-specific dysfunction. This integrative approach serves to highlight how memory research in ASD may enhance our understanding of memory processes and networks in the typical brain. We make suggestions for future research that are important for further specifying the neurocognitive basis of episodic recollection in ASD and linking such difficulties to social developmental and educational outcomes.
Task switching in autism: An EEG study on intentions and actions.One of the main symptoms of Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) is experiencing cognitive inflexibility when adjustments of behaviour are required. While this so-called behavioural rigidity is broadly recognised in ASC, finding evidence for the underlying neurocognitive mechanisms remains challenging. In this electroencephalographic (EEG) study, participants with ASC and matched controls were instructed to choose between two cognitive tasks in each trial, and to respond to the subsequently presented target stimulus according to their task choice. While doing so, we tracked the frontally distributed contingent negative variation (CNV) during the task preparation interval as a measure of intentional control, and the posteriorly measured P3 during the task execution interval to monitor the translation of intentions into actions. The results support the notion of intentional control difficulties in ASC, where the CNV was attenuated in the ASC group compared to the control group. Furthermore, the CNV was differentiated between the tasks and transition types in the control group only, suggesting that the ASC group was less fine-tuning the required amount of intentional control to contextual circumstances. In contrast, the P3 showed no significant differences between the groups. Together, these findings highlight the importance of intentional control mechanisms as a crucial future route for a better understanding of cognitive flexibility and behavioural rigidity in ASC.
Plasma concentrations of the trace elements copper, zinc and selenium in Brazilian children with autism spectrum disorder.The association between the plasma levels of trace elements, such as copper (Cu), zinc (Zn) and selenium (Se), in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), has attracted the interest of many physicians in the very recent years, because the impaired homeostatic regulation of trace elements, including their levels in the bloodstream and their potential neurotoxicity, contribute to the onset and exacerbation of ASD. In this study, we investigated 23 pediatric subjects (≤ 18 yrs old, both sexes) with ASD, all residents in the city of Campo Grande in Brazil, by searching for their micronutrient levels in plasma in relation with metabolic and nutrition biomarkers. Aside for the few evidence reported, generally, the Brazilian cohort of ASD children here examined did not show a marked difference in micro-nutrient intake in relation with their resident geographical area and their dietary habit or metabolic state, although a slight difference in the levels of magnesium and phosphorus was retrieved due to sex difference.
Caregiver Strategies to Enhance Participation in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder.Participation is necessary for childhood development, however, children with disabilities participate in fewer activities than their nondisabled peers. This study identified strategies caregivers use to increase participation in home- and community-based activities for children with autism spectrum disorder. Survey responses of 44 caregivers were analyzed through open and axial coding to develop a central theme and five broad themes. Caregiver strategies which produce a participation outcome fell into five themes: (a) adapters/facilitators, (b) pragmatic considerations, (c) social reframing, (d) sensory adjustments, and (e) desperate measures. Nonproductive strategies were identified where the child did not participate in the activity. Adaptations/facilitators were more likely used in the home, whereas community-based strategies were more often pragmatic considerations. Nonproductive strategies occurred more frequently in the community. When evaluating a child's participation, occupational therapy (OT) practitioners should take into consideration the context of the activity to identify appropriate and helpful strategies.
A MicroRNA-Based Gene-Targeting Tool for Virally Labeling Interneurons in the Rodent Cortex.More specific and broadly applicable viral gene-targeting tools for labeling neuron subtypes are needed to advance neuroscience research, especially in rodent transgenic disease models and genetically intractable species. Here, we develop a viral vector that restricts transgene expression to GABAergic interneurons in the rodent neocortex by exploiting endogenous microRNA regulation. Our interneuron-targeting, microRNA-guided neuron tag, "GABA mAGNET," achieves >95% interneuron selective labeling in the mouse cortex, including in a murine model of autism and also some preferential labeling of interneurons in the rat brain. We demonstrate an application of our GABA mAGNET by performing simultaneous, in vivo optogenetic control of two distinct neuron subtypes. This interneuron labeling tool highlights the potential of microRNA-based viral gene targeting to specific neuron subtypes.
Leptin and camel milk abate oxidative stress status, genotoxicity induced in valproic acid rat model of autism.The aspect of treatment of autistic behaviour was investigated using valproic acid rat model of pregnant female rats. Two main groups (10 male rats/group) were treated for 6 days and then divided into six subgroups. The first group of normal rats was divided into three subgroups: (A) - control group, (B) - treated with camel milk (CAM; 2 mL/p.o) and (C) - treated with leptin (1000 µg/kg i.p) twice daily. The second group of autistic rats was randomly distributed into four subgroups as follows: (D) - positive control (autistics rats), (E) - treated with CAM, (F) - treated with a moderate dose of leptin and (G) - treated with a higher dose of leptin. Autistic behaviours of male offspring were checked by grooming and elevated pulz maze tests. Valproic acid (VPA)-induced autistic rats showed severe changes in oxidative stress markers, neurotransmitters and inflammatory cytokines, besides genotoxic manifestation of expression of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, Bax and caspase-3. Leptin or CAM alone showed no signs of toxicity. CAM showed pronounced improvement in control rats than control itself. Leptin or CAM treatment of autistic animals showed a significant improvement of all measured parameters and genetic expression values. The improvement was pronounced in animals treated with CAM. These results suggest that CAM is a potential therapeutic candidate for autism via regulation of inflammatory and apoptotic pathways. Leptin plays an essential role in alleviation of autistic behaviour through antioxidant effects.
Teaching children with autism to identify and respond appropriately to the preferences of others during play.We observed three children with autism spectrum disorder during structured play dates in which play partners displayed interest or disinterest in the toys with which they were playing. We then taught subjects to identify play partners' preferences and to make appropriate toy offers using a multiple-exemplar training package consisting of rules, midplay preference questions, prompting, and praise with observed generalization across untrained partners.
Modeling the connections of brain regions in children with autism using cellular neural networks and electroencephalography analysis.The brain connections in the different regions demonstrate the characteristics of brain activities. In addition, in various conditions and with neuropsychological disorders, the brain has special patterns in different regions. This paper presents a model to show and compare the connection patterns in different brain regions of children with autism (53 boys and 36 girls) and control children (61 boys and 33 girls). The model is designed by cellular neural networks and it uses the proper features of electroencephalography. The results show that there are significant differences and abnormalities in the left hemisphere, (p < 0.05) at the electrodes AF3, F3, P7, T7, and O1 in the children with autism compared with the control group. Also, the evaluation of the obtained connections values between brain regions demonstrated that there are more abnormalities in the connectivity of frontal and parietal lobes and the relations of the neighboring regions in children with autism. It is observed that the proposed model is able to distinguish the autistic children from the control subjects with an accuracy rate of 95.1% based on the obtained values of CNN using the SVM method.
Age, Disease, and Their Interaction Effects on Intrinsic Connectivity of Children and Adolescents in Autism Spectrum Disorder Using Functional Connectomics.Brain connectivity analysis has provided crucial insights to pinpoint the differences between autistic and typically developing (TD) children during development. The aim of this study is to investigate the functional connectomics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) versus TD and underpin the effects of development, disease, and their interactions on the observed atypical brain connectivity patterns. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) data set, which is stratified into two cohorts: children (9-12 years) and adolescents (13-16 years), is used for the analysis. Differences in various graph theoretical network measures are calculated between ASD and TD in each group. Furthermore, two-factor analysis of variance test is used to study the effect of age, disease, and their interaction on the network measures and the network edges. Furthermore, the differences in connection strength between TD and ASD subjects are assessed using network-based statistics. The results showed that ASD exhibits increased functional integration at the expense of decreased functional segregation. In ASD adolescents, there is a significant decrease in modularity suggesting a less robust modular organization, and an increase in participation coefficient suggesting more random integration and widely distributed connection edges. Furthermore, there is significant hypoconnectivity observed in the adolescent group especially in the default mode network, while the children group shows both hyper- and hypoconnectivity. This study lends support to a model of global atypical connections and further identifies functional networks and areas that are independently affected by age, disease, and their interaction.
Sustainability of Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention for Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder in a Community Setting.This study examined whether outcomes in early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI) during a university-led multisite project could be replicated by the same community agency independently of the project. Participants, age 18 to 75 months at onset of intervention, were 48 children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) enrolled in 35 hr per week of publicly funded, community-based EIBI for 3 years and 46 children who were matched on baseline characteristics and received early childhood services as usual (SAU) through local early childhood special education providers. Linear mixed models indicated that EIBI participants improved significantly more than SAU participants on standardized tests of IQ, nonverbal IQ, adaptive behavior, and academic achievement, administered by independent evaluators. Although limited by the use of a matched comparison group rather than random assignment, the study provides evidence for the sustainability of effective EIBI in community settings for children with ASD who start intervention at varying ages throughout early childhood.
Neurobiology, not artifacts: Challenges and guidelines for imaging the high risk infant.The search for the brain-basis of atypical development in human infants is challenging because the process of imaging and the generation of the MR signal itself relies on assumptions that reflect biophysical properties of the brain tissue. These assumptions are not inviolate, have been questioned by recent empirical evidence from high risk infant-sibling studies, and to date remain largely underexamined at the between-group level. In particular, I consider recent work showing that infants at High vs. Low familial risk (HR vs. LR, respectively) for developing Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) have atypical patterns of head movements during an MR scan that are functionally important-they are linked to future learning trajectories in toddlerhood. Addressing head movement issues in neuroimaging analyses in infant research as well as understanding the causes of these movements from a developmental perspective requires acknowledging the complexity of this endeavor. For example, head movement signatures in infants can interact with experimental task conditions (such as listening to language compared to sleeping), autism risk, and age. How can new knowledge about newborns' individual, subject-specific behavioral differences which may impact MR signal acquisition and statistical inference ignite critical thinking for the field of infant brain imaging across the spectrum of typical and atypical development? Early behavioral differences between HR and LR infant cohorts that are often examples of "artifactual" confounds in MR work provide insight into nascent neurobiological differences, including biophysical tissue properties and hemodynamic response variability, in these and related populations at risk for atypical development. Are these neurobiological drivers of atypical development? This work identifies important knowledge gaps and suggests guidelines at the leading edge of baby imaging science to transform our understanding of atypical brain development in humans. The precise study of the neurobiological underpinnings of atypical development in humans calls for approaches including quantitative MRI (qMRI) pulse sequences, multi-modal imaging (including DTI, MRS, as well as MEG), and infant-specific HRF shapes when modeling BOLD signal.
Investigating the perception of face identity in adults on the autism spectrum using behavioural and electrophysiological measures.In the present study, we investigated face processing in individuals with self-reported Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD, n = 16) and typically developing control participants (n = 16) using behavioural and electrophysiological measures. As a measure of their face memory, we administered the Cambridge Face Memory Test to participants in the ASD group. The results showed that the scores of the ASD participants were reliably below the age- and gender-matched norms of neurotypical individuals. To measure brain responses to faces, we used the fast periodic visual stimulation method, presenting photographs of a same-identity face (i.e., base face) at a constant frequency of 6 Hz (F) interleaved with different-identity faces (i.e., the oddball faces) presented at 1.2 Hz. The 6 Hz presentation of the base face and 1.2 Hz presentation of the oddball face elicited periodic brain responses corresponding to face detection and face individuation processes, respectively. Participants viewed four blocks of upright faces and four blocks of inverted faces. The results showed an enhanced EEG response to upright base faces at 6 Hz frequency and its harmonics compared to inverted faces, and the response was most focal over medial occipital channels. An enhanced response was found to upright oddball faces at 1.2 Hz and its harmonics compared to the inverted faces, and the response was centred over occipito-temporal channels in the right hemisphere. Critically, no differences or interactions were found between the ASD and typically developing groups in the responses to either the 6 Hz base faces or the 1.2 oddball faces. These results suggest that in individuals with ASD, the earlier stage of face perception, as measured by the fast periodic visual stimulation paradigm, can be dissociated from the later memory stage of face processing, as assessed by the Cambridge Face Memory Test.
Aberrant hemodynamic responses in autism: Implications for resting state fMRI functional connectivity studies.Functional MRI (fMRI) is modeled as a convolution of the hemodynamic response function (HRF) and an unmeasured latent neural signal. However, HRF itself is variable across brain regions and subjects. This variability is induced by both neural and non-neural factors. Aberrations in underlying neurochemical mechanisms, which control HRF shape, have been reported in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Therefore, we hypothesized that this will lead to voxel-specific, yet systematic differences in HRF shape between ASD and healthy controls. As a corollary, we also hypothesized that such alterations will lead to differences in estimated functional connectivity in fMRI space compared to latent neural space. To test these hypotheses, we performed blind deconvolution of resting-state fMRI time series acquired from large number of ASD and control subjects obtained from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) database (N = 1102). Many brain regions previously implicated in autism showed systematic differences in HRF shape in ASD. Specifically, we found that precuneus had aberrations in all HRF parameters. Consequently, we obtained precuneus-seed-based functional connectivity differences between ASD and controls using fMRI as well as using latent neural signals. We found that non-deconvolved fMRI data failed to detect group differences in connectivity between precuneus and certain brain regions that were instead observed in deconvolved data. Our results are relevant for the understanding of hemodynamic and neurochemical aberrations in ASD, as well as have methodological implications for resting-state functional connectivity studies in Autism, and more generally in disorders that are accompanied by neurochemical alterations that may impact HRF shape.
Brief Report: Cross-Modal Capture: Preliminary Evidence of Inefficient Filtering in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.This study investigates how task-irrelevant auditory information is processed in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Eighteen children with ASD and 19 age- and IQ-matched typically developing (TD) children were presented with semantically-congruent and incongruent picture-sound pairs, and in separate tasks were instructed to attend to only visual or both audio-visual sensory channels. Preliminary results showed that when required to attend to both modalities, both groups were equally slowed for semantically-incongruent compared to congruent pairs. However, when asked to attend to only visual information, children with ASD were disproportionally slowed by incongruent auditory information, suggesting that they may have more difficulty filtering task-irrelevant cross-modal information. Correlational analyses showed that this inefficient cross-modal attentional filtering was related to greater sociocommunicative impairment.
Movement Disorders and Syndromic Autism: A Systematic Review.Movement disorders are reported in idiopathic autism but the extent to which comparable movement disorders are found in syndromic/co-morbid autism is unknown. A systematic search of Medline, Embase, PsychINFO and CINAHL on the prevalence of specific movement disorder in syndromic autism associated with specific genetic syndromes identified 16 papers, all relating to Angelman syndrome or Rett syndrome. Prevalence rates of 72.7-100% and 25.0-27.3% were reported for ataxia and tremor, respectively, in Angelman syndrome. In Rett syndrome, prevalence rates of 43.6-50% were reported for ataxia and 27.3-48.3% for tremor with additional reports of dystonia, rigidity and pyramidal signs. However, reliable assessment measures were rarely used and recruitment was often not described in sufficient detail.
Mouse models of maternal immune activation: Mind your caging system!Rodent models of maternal immune activation (MIA) are increasingly used as experimental tools to study neuronal and behavioral dysfunctions in relation to infection-mediated neurodevelopmental disorders. One of the most widely used MIA models is based on gestational administration of poly(I:C) (= polyriboinosinic-polyribocytdilic acid), a synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA that induces a cytokine-associated viral-like acute phase response. The effects of poly(I:C)-induced MIA on phenotypic changes in the offspring are known to be influenced by various factors, including the precise prenatal timing, genetic background, and immune stimulus intensity. Thus far, however, it has been largely ignored whether differences in the basic type of laboratory housing can similarly affect the outcomes of MIA models. Here, we examined this possibility by comparing the poly(I:C)-based MIA model in two housing systems that are commonly used in preclinical mouse research, namely the open cage (OC) and individually ventilated cage (IVC) systems. Pregnant C57BL6/N mice were kept in OCs or IVCs and treated with a low (1 mg/kg, i.v.) or high (5 mg/kg, i.v.) dose of poly(I:C), or with control vehicle solution. MIA or control treatment was induced on gestation day (GD) 9 or 12, and the resulting offspring were raised and maintained in OCs or IVCs until adulthood for behavioral testing. An additional cohort of dams was used to assess the influence of the different caging systems on poly(I:C)-induced cytokine and stress responses in the maternal plasma. Maternal poly(I:C) administration on GD9 caused a dose-dependent increase in spontaneous abortion in IVCs but not in OCs, whereas MIA in IVC systems during a later gestational time-point (GD12) did not affect pregnancy outcomes. Moreover, the precise type of caging system markedly affected maternal cytokines and chemokines at basal states and in response to poly(I:C) and further influenced the maternal levels of the stress hormone, corticosterone. The efficacy of MIA to induce deficits in working memory, social interaction, and sensorimotor gating in the adult offspring was influenced by the different housing conditions, the dosing of poly(I:C), and the precise prenatal timing. Taken together, the present study identifies the basic type of caging system as a novel factor that can confound the outcomes of MIA in mice. Our findings thus urge the need to consider and report the kind of laboratory housing systems used to implement MIA models. Providing this information seems pivotal to yield reproducible results in these models.
Ex-Gaussian, Frequency and Reward Analyses Reveal Specificity of Reaction Time Fluctuations to ADHD and Not Autism Traits.Both attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been linked to increased reaction time variability (RTV), a marker of attentional fluctuation. Here we test whether specificity to either trait emerges when we examine (1) detailed ex-Gaussian and frequency RTV subcomponents, (2) effects while controlling for the other trait and (3) improvement in the RTV measures following rewards or a faster event rate. 1110 children aged 7-10 years from a population-based sample completed a Go/No-Go task under three conditions (slow, fast and incentives). We measured RTV with standard deviation of RT (SDRT), ex-Gaussian distribution measures (Sigma and Tau), RT fluctuations in cycles of ~14-90 s in all conditions (Slow-4 and Slow-5), and RT fluctuations in cycles of 2-14 s in the fast condition (Slow-2 and Slow-3). Parent-rated ADHD and ASD traits were obtained. All refined RTV components were linked to ADHD traits only and not to ASD traits, while Sigma did not relate to either trait. Although both ADHD and ASD social-communication traits were associated with SDRT, the association with social-communication impairments disappeared when controlling for ADHD traits. A reward-induced improvement in RTV measures, indicating malleability, emerged in relation to ADHD traits but not ASD traits. Under closer inspection, specificity emerges of high RTV to ADHD traits. For the clinician, our findings indicate that attentional fluctuation in children with high ASD traits may be due to co-occurring ADHD traits and emphasise how the effectiveness of rewards does not generalise from ADHD to ASD traits.
Autism-related behaviors in the cyclooxygenase-2-deficient mouse model.Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is an endogenous lipid molecule involved in normal brain development. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) is the main regulator of PGE2 synthesis. Emerging clinical and molecular research provides compelling evidence that abnormal COX2/PGE2 signaling is associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We previously found that COX2 knockout mice had dysregulated expression of many ASD genes belonging to important biological pathways for neurodevelopment. The present study is the first to show the connection between irregular COX2/PGE2 signaling and autism-related behaviors in male and female COX2-deficient knockin, (COX)-2
Bayesian Correction for Exposure Misclassification and Evolution of Evidence in Two Studies of the Association Between Maternal Occupational Exposure to Asthmagens and Risk of Autism Spectrum Disorder.Inference in epidemiologic studies is plagued by exposure misclassification. Several methods exist to correct for misclassification error. One approach is to use point estimates for the sensitivity (Sn) and specificity (Sp) of the tool used for exposure assessment. Unfortunately, we typically do not know the Sn and Sp with certainty. Bayesian methods for exposure misclassification correction allow us to model this uncertainty via distributions for Sn and Sp. These methods have been applied in epidemiologic literature, but are not considered a mainstream approach, especially in occupational epidemiology.
Stem Cells to Inform the Neurobiology of Mental Illness.The inception of human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSCs) technology has provided an exciting platform upon which the modelling and treatment of human neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders may be expedited. Although the genetic architecture of these disorders is far more complex than previously imagined, many key loci have at last been identified. This has allowed in vivo and in vitro technologies to be refined to model specific high-penetrant genetic loci involved in both disorders. Animal models of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders, show limitations in recapitulating the full complexity and heterogeneity of human neurodevelopmental disease states. Indeed, patient-derived hiPSCs offer distinct advantages over classical animal models in the study of human neuropathologies. Here we have discussed the current, relative translational merit of hiPSCs in investigating human neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders with a specific emphasis on the utility of such systems to aid in the identification of biomarkers. We have highlighted the promises and pitfalls of reprogramming cell fate for the study of these disorders and provide recommendations for future directions in this field in order to overcome current limitations. Ultimately, this will aid in the development of effective clinical strategies for diverse patient populations affected by these disorders with the aim of also leading to biomarker identification.
Nanoparticle formulations that allow for sustained delivery and brain targeting of the neuropeptide oxytocin.Oxytocin is a promising candidate for the treatment of social-deficit disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder, but oxytocin cannot readily pass the blood-brain barrier. Moreover, oxytocin requires frequent dosing as it is rapidly metabolized in blood. We fabricated four polymeric nanoparticle formulations using poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) or bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the base material. In order to target them to the brain, we then conjugated the materials to either transferrin or rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG) as targeting ligands. The formulations were characterized in vitro for size, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency, and release profiles. All formulations showed slightly negative charges and sizes ranging from 100 to 278 nm in diameter, with RVG-conjugated BSA nanoparticles exhibiting the smallest sizes. No formulation was found to be immunogenic or cytotoxic. The encapsulation efficiency was ≥75% for all nanoparticle formulations. Release studies demonstrated that BSA nanoparticle formulation exhibited a faster initial burst of release compared to PLGA particles, in addition to later sustained release. This initial burst release would be favorable for clinical dosing as therapeutic effects could be quickly established, especially in combination with additional sustained release to maintain the therapeutic effects. Our size and release profile data indicate that RVG-conjugated BSA nanoparticles are the most favorable formulation for brain delivery of oxytocin.
Prior depressive symptoms and persistent child problem behaviours predict future depression in parents of children with developmental disabilities: The growing up in Ireland cohort study.Predictors of depression over time were examined in parental carers of children with developmental disabilities (DD) and parents of typically developing children (controls) who participated in the Growing up in Ireland Study. Parents completed measures of depression, the Centre for Epidemiological Depression Scale (CES-D) and child problem behaviours, the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire when the children were aged 9 (Wave 1) and 13 (Wave 2). Using CES-D cut-off scores to indicate probable depression, caregivers were more likely to be depressed at both waves compared to controls with a Wave 1 rate of depression of 14.6% vs. 7.9% (p < 0.001, Cramer`s V = 0.059) and Wave 2 (14.8% vs. 10%, p = 0.003, Cramer`s V = 0.038). While overall rates of depression were stable for caregivers, a shifting pattern emerged; 59.6% of those who were depressed at Wave 1, were not at Wave 2; similarly, 10.9% who were not depressed at Wave 1, were at Wave 2. Parents of children with DD were also more likely to report greater problem behaviours in their children compared to controls at both waves. Depression in caregivers at Wave 1 and persistent child problem behaviours were significant predictors of depression at Wave 2. In conclusion, while overall rates of depression remain stable in caregivers, there are shifting patterns evident with prior depression and persistent behaviour problems predictive of ongoing depression.
The role of neurotensin in vulnerability for self-injurious behaviour: studies in a rodent model.Self-injurious behaviour is a debilitating characteristic that is commonly expressed in people with autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders, but the neurobiological basis of this maladaptive behaviour is not understood. Abnormal dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission has been implicated, especially in relation to basal ganglia and mesocorticolimbic circuits. As neurotensin is an important modulator of dopamine and glutamate in these circuits, we investigated its potential role in vulnerability for self-injury, using the pemoline model in rats.
Neural correlates of taste reactivity in autism spectrum disorder.Selective or 'picky' eating habits are common among those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). These behaviors are often related to aberrant sensory experience in individuals with ASD, including heightened reactivity to food taste and texture. However, very little is known about the neural mechanisms that underlie taste reactivity in ASD. In the present study, food-related neural responses were evaluated in 21 young adult and adolescent males diagnosed with ASD without intellectual disability, and 21 typically-developing (TD) controls. Taste reactivity was assessed using the Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile, a clinical self-report measure. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to evaluate hemodynamic responses to sweet (vs. neutral) tastants and food pictures. Subjects also underwent resting-state functional connectivity scans.The ASD and TD individuals did not differ in their hemodynamic response to gustatory stimuli. However, the ASD subjects, but not the controls, exhibited a positive association between self-reported taste reactivity and the response to sweet tastants within the insular cortex and multiple brain regions associated with gustatory perception and reward. There was a strong interaction between diagnostic group and taste reactivity on tastant response in brain regions associated with ASD pathophysiology, including the bilateral anterior superior temporal sulcus (STS). This interaction of diagnosis and taste reactivity was also observed in the resting state functional connectivity between the anterior STS and dorsal mid-insula (i.e., gustatory cortex).These results suggest that self-reported heightened taste reactivity in ASD is associated with heightened brain responses to food-related stimuli and atypical functional connectivity of primary gustatory cortex, which may predispose these individuals to maladaptive and unhealthy patterns of selective eating behavior.
Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder manifesting as lifelong deficits in social communication and interaction, as well as restricted repetitive behaviors, interests and activities. While there are no specific pharmacological or other physical treatments for autism, in recent years repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), a technique for non-invasive neuromodulation, has attracted interest due to potential therapeutic value. Here we report the results of a systematic literature review and meta-analysis on the use of rTMS to treat ASD.
Stability of child temperament: Multiple moderation by child and mother characteristics.This 3-wave longitudinal study focuses on stability of child temperament from 3 to 6 years and considers child age, gender, birth order, and term status as well as mother age, education, anxiety, and depression as moderators of stability. Mothers of approximately 10,000 children participating in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children rated child temperament. Stability coefficients for child temperament scales were medium to large, and stability was generally robust across moderators except child gender and birth order and mother age and education, which had small moderating effects on reports of stability of child temperament. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Some is known about the stability of temperament in infancy in small samples, but much less is known about the stability of temperament in early childhood or its moderation. What does this study add? This study uses a large sample (˜10,000) to trace the stability of temperament from 3 to 6 years in three waves and considers child age, gender, birth order, and term status as well as mother age, education, anxiety, and depression as moderators of stability.
Designing a Chat-Bot for Non-Verbal Children on the Autism Spectrum.There is a significant amount of anecdotal evidence of the benefits of individuals on the autism spectrum interacting with technology via natural language. Many of these individuals are non-verbal but still able to communicate via augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) aids. This paper presents the design of a AAC software program (app) with embedded artificial conversational agent, called Alex. Alex runs on a Android device and is able to engage with the user on a variety of topics using symbols and images. Alex may be programmed via speech and occupational therapists and other key stakeholders via speech and hence does not require any specialised computer skills. The importance of customisation, interoperability, personalisation and motor skill considerations is herein discussed.
Oxytocin and Gynecomastia: Correlation or Causality?Oxytocin has been administered to patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in order to improve social skills, communication, and manage repetitive behaviors in the context of research trials. The majority of the studies focus on acute administration; thus, the effectiveness and potential side effects of chronic administration remain unknown. The main goal of this case report is to highlight the importance of the safety parameters for the chronic use of intranasal oxytocin administration. In a single case conducted in our outpatient clinic, one adolescent (15 years old) received intranasal oxytocin (24 IU) twice per day, in accordance with the recommended doses for this age group that varies from 8 - 25 IU twice per day. After three weeks of treatment, the patient presented with gynecomastia. While it is not certain that the gynecomastia was oxytocin-induced, this case highlights the importance of developing optimal regimens for chronic oxytocin administration, with a particular focus on safety parameters.
Brief Report: Differences in Multisensory Integration Covary with Sensory Responsiveness in Children with and without Autism Spectrum Disorder.Research shows that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) differ in their behavioral patterns of responding to sensory stimuli (i.e., sensory responsiveness) and in various other aspects of sensory functioning relative to typical peers. This study explored relations between measures of sensory responsiveness and multisensory speech perception and integration in children with and without ASD. Participants were 8-17 year old children, 18 with ASD and 18 matched typically developing controls. Participants completed a psychophysical speech perception task, and parents reported on children's sensory responsiveness. Psychophysical measures (e.g., audiovisual accuracy, temporal binding window) were associated with patterns of sensory responsiveness (e.g., hyporesponsiveness, sensory seeking). Results indicate that differences in multisensory speech perception and integration covary with atypical patterns of sensory responsiveness.
ECHO Autism STAT: Accelerating Early Access to Autism Diagnosis.Although early diagnosis of autism is critical for promoting access to early intervention, many children experience significant diagnostic delays. Shortages of healthcare providers, limited capacity at autism centers, and geographic and socioeconomic challenges contribute to these delays. The current pilot study examined the feasibility of a new model for training community-based primary care providers (PCPs) in underserved areas in screening and diagnosis of young children at highest risk for autism. By combining hands-on training in standardized techniques with ongoing virtual mentorship and practice, the program emphasized both timely diagnosis and appropriate referral for more comprehensive assessment when necessary. Results indicated improvements in PCP practice and self-efficacy, and feasibility of the model for enhancing local access to care.
Cord and Early Childhood Plasma Adiponectin Levels and Autism Risk: A Prospective Birth Cohort Study.Emerging research suggests that adiponectin, a cytokine produced by adipose tissue, may be implicated in ASD. In this prospective birth cohort study (n = 847), we assessed the association between cord, early childhood plasma adiponectin and the risk of developing ASD. ASD was defined based on ICD codes of physician diagnosis. Cord adiponectin levels were inversely associated with ASD risk (aOR 0.50; 95% CI 0.33, 0.77), independent of preterm birth, early childhood adiponectin and other known ASD risk factors. Early childhood adiponectin, assessed prior to ASD diagnosis, was associated with lower risk of ASD, which attenuated after adjusting for cord adiponectin, indicating the relative importance of cord adiponectin in ASD risk. Further research is warranted to confirm our findings and elucidate biological mechanisms.
The Autism-Related Protein PX-RICS Mediates GABAergic Synaptic Plasticity in Hippocampal Neurons and Emotional Learning in Mice.GABAergic dysfunction underlies many neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. GABAergic synapses exhibit several forms of plasticity at both pre- and postsynaptic levels. NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent inhibitory long-term potentiation (iLTP) at GABAergic postsynapses requires an increase in surface GABA
Brief Report: Low Rates of Herpesvirus Detection in Blood of Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder and Controls.Previous research indicates that infection, especially from viruses in the family Herpesviridae, may play a role in the etiology of some cases of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Using a case-control design and the polymerase chain reaction with site-specific primers, we screened newborn and childhood blood samples for the presence of eight human herpesviruses. Herpesvirus DNA was detected in 4 of 225 ASD individuals and 2 of 235 controls, with the most frequently detected virus being HHV-6B. Although this study does not detect a significant ASD-Herpesviridae association, it is limited by the use of site-specific primers. We suggest that new techniques using bioinformatics to search next-generation sequencing databases will be more revealing of possible ASD-virus associations.
Autism spectrum disorder in females with ARHGEF9 alterations and a random pattern of X chromosome inactivation.Proper function of GABAergic synapses depends upon the postsynaptic compartment anchoring of neurotransmitter receptors to the membrane by gephyrin and collybistin (Cb). In humans, Cb is encoded by ARHGEF9 on Xq11.1. ARHGEF9 alterations, some inherited from unaffected mothers, have been reported in males with autism, seizures and severe neurodevelopmental abnormalities. In females, a spectrum of mild to moderate phenotype has been detected. We report two unrelated females with autism and mild intellectual disability. High resolution X-chromosome microarray analysis revealed de novo intragenic deletions in ARHGEF9 of 24 kb and 56 kb involving exons 5-8 and exons 3-8 and leading to truncated forms of collybistin. Peripheral blood samples revealed random X-chromosome inactivation in both patients. To explain phenotypic variability in female patients, we propose a model for disruption of collybistin and various irregular interactions in post-synaptic neurons based on X inactivation patterns. Our findings highlight the importance of ARHGEF9 integrity and suggest further research on its correlation with autism and neurobehavioral problems.
Frontal lobe metabolic alterations in autism spectrum disorder: a Recently, neuroimaging studies were performed using
Fast and Accurate Diagnosis of Autism (FADA): a novel hierarchical fuzzy system based autism detection tool.The main aim of this research work was to develop and validate a novel graphical user interface based hierarchical fuzzy autism detection tool named as "Fast and Accurate Diagnosis of Autism" for the diagnosis of autism disorder quickly and accurately and in addition, this tool also highlights the highly impaired area in each participant. Two groups of children had been participated in this study which includes autism group (N = 40) and normal group (N = 40). The hierarchical fuzzy expert system had been developed using IF-Then rules based on the experiences of the specialists and both the groups were tested on the designed system. It had been validated that the designed system was easily discriminating between the autistic participants and normal participants with an accuracy of 99%. Moreover, the results of the designed system were compared with Childhood Autism Rating Scale; also the tool was clearly highlighting the most impaired area in each participant. It had also been seen that the designed system has a sensitivity of 98.2% and specificity of 99.2%. It can be said that the designed tool can be used by doctors to diagnose autism along with its severity levels and to highlight the highly impaired area accurately and in no time.
Mock Juror Perceptions of Child Witnesses on the Autism Spectrum: The Impact of Providing Diagnostic Labels and Information About Autism.Research suggests that autistic children can provide accurate and forensically useful eyewitness evidence. However, members of a jury also rely on non-verbal behaviours when judging the credibility of a witness, and this could determine the verdict of a case. We presented mock jurors with videos (from an experimental study) of one of two child witnesses on the autism spectrum being interviewed about a mock minor crime. Results demonstrated that providing jurors with generic information about autism and/or informing them of the child's diagnostic label differentially affected credibility ratings, but not for both children. Implications for how to present information about child witnesses with autism to a jury-highlighting the need for approaches tailored to individual children-are discussed.
Gray space and green space proximity associated with higher anxiety in youth with autism.This study used ZIP code level data on children's health (National Survey of Children's Health, 2012) and land cover (National Land Cover Database, 2011) from across the United States to investigate connections between proximity to green space (tree canopy), gray space (impervious surfaces), and expression of a critical co-morbid condition, anxiety, in three groups of youth: children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD, n = 1501), non-ASD children with special healthcare needs (CSHCN, n = 15,776), and typically developing children (n = 53,650). Both impervious surface coverage and tree canopy coverage increased the risk of severe anxiety in youth with autism, but not CSHCN or typical children. Children with ASD might experience the stress-reducing benefits of nature differently than their typically developing peers. More research using objective diagnostic metrics at finer spatial scales would help to illuminate complex relationships between green space, anxiety, and other co-morbid conditions in youth with ASD.
Using game technology to teach six elementary school children with autism to take a shower independently.This paper contributes to research investigating the effectiveness of video game intervention in shower training of children with autism spectrum disorders. Previous studies have supported the use of video games in special education.
Sensory features as predictors of adaptive behaviors: A comparative longitudinal study of children with autism spectrum disorder and other developmental disabilities.Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other developmental disabilities (DD) exhibit sensory features that differ from their typically developing peers. Prior cross-sectional research has demonstrated significant associations between elevated sensory features and lower adaptive behavior scores, yet there is limited prospective research examining longitudinal associations.
Safety and Lack of Negative Effects of Wearable Augmented-Reality Social Communication Aid for Children and Adults with Autism.There is a growing interest in the use of augmented reality (AR) to assist children and adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD); however, little investigation has been conducted into the safety of AR devices, such as smartglasses. The objective of this report was to assess the safety and potential negative effects of the
A Feasibility Clinical Trial to Improve Social Attention in Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Using a Brain Computer Interface.Deficits in the interpretation of others' intentions from gaze-direction or other social attention cues are well-recognized in ASD. Here we investigated whether an EEG brain computer interface (BCI) can be used to train social cognition skills in ASD patients. We performed a single-arm feasibility clinical trial and enrolled 15 participants (mean age 22y 2m) with high-functioning ASD (mean full-scale IQ 103). Participants were submitted to a BCI training paradigm using a virtual reality interface over seven sessions spread over 4 months. The first four sessions occurred weekly, and the remainder monthly. In each session, the subject was asked to identify objects of interest based on the gaze direction of an avatar. Attentional responses were extracted from the EEG P300 component. A final follow-up assessment was performed 6-months after the last session. To analyze responses to joint attention cues participants were assessed pre and post intervention and in the follow-up, using an ecologic "Joint-attention task." We used eye-tracking to identify the number of social attention items that a patient could accurately identify from an avatar's action cues (e.g., looking, pointing at). As secondary outcome measures we used the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC) and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS). Neuropsychological measures related to mood and depression were also assessed. In sum, we observed a decrease in total ATEC and rated autism symptoms (Sociability; Sensory/Cognitive Awareness; Health/Physical/Behavior); an evident improvement in Adapted Behavior Composite and in the DLS subarea from VABS; a decrease in Depression (from POMS) and in mood disturbance/depression (BDI). BCI online performance and tolerance were stable along the intervention. Average P300 amplitude and alpha power were also preserved across sessions. We have demonstrated the feasibility of BCI in this kind of intervention in ASD. Participants engage successfully and consistently in the task. Although the primary outcome (rate of automatic responses to joint attention cues) did not show changes, most secondary neuropsychological outcome measures showed improvement, yielding promise for a future efficacy trial. (clinical-trial ID: NCT02445625-clinicaltrials.gov).
Longitudinal Epidemiological Study of Autism Subgroups Using Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC) Score.Here we report the results of the subgroup analyses of an observational cohort of children whose parents completed the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC) over the period of several years. A linear mixed effects model was used to evaluate longitudinal changes in ATEC scores within different patient subgroups. All groups decreased their mean ATEC score over time indicating improvement of symptoms, however there were significant differences between the groups. Younger children improved more than the older children. Children with milder ASD improved more than children with more severe ASD in the Communication subscale. There was no difference in improvement between females vs. males. One surprising finding was that children from developed English-speaking countries improved less than children from non-English-speaking countries.
Brief Report: Gender Identity Differences in Autistic Adults: Associations with Perceptual and Socio-cognitive Profiles.Prior research has shown an elevation in autism traits and diagnoses in individuals seen for gender related consultation and in participants self-identifying as transgender. To investigate this relationship between autism and gender identity from a new angle, we compared the self-reported autism traits and sensory differences between participants with autism who did or did not identify with their assigned sex (i.e. cisgender or trans and non-binary, respectively). We found broad elevation of most cognitive autism traits in the trans and non-binary group (those who identified with a gender other than their assigned gender), and lower visual and auditory hypersensitivity. We contrast these data to existing hypotheses and propose a role for autistic resistance to social conditioning.
Parent and Teacher Reports of Comorbid Anxiety and ADHD Symptoms in Children with ASD.This study examined the prevalence of ADHD symptoms and anxiety as reported by parents and teachers for 180 preschool children (ages 4-5) and school-aged children (ages 6-7) with ASD using the Child Behavior Checklist-Parent and Teacher Report Forms (Achenbach and Rescorla, Manual for ASEBA school-age forms & profiles, Research Center for Children, Youth, and Families, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT, 2001). Parents reported elevated anxiety symptoms in 31% of preschool children and 50% of school-aged children, while teachers reported lower rates of 5 and 30%, respectively. Parents reported elevated ADHD symptoms in 22% of preschool children and 45% of school-aged children, while teachers reported elevations in 20 and 24%, respectively. There was low concordance between parents and teachers, with teachers reporting fewer problems overall. Specific behaviors endorsed by parents and teachers are also discussed.
Postnatal low-concentration arsenic exposure induces autism-like behavior and affects frontal cortex neurogenesis in rats.This study aimed to explore the effects of postnatal low-concentration arsenic exposure on learning, social skills and frontal cortex neurogenesis in rats. Water-based arsenic exposure rat models were established on postnatal days 4-10 (P4-P10). The experimental animals were divided into four groups: the control group, a 15 μg/L As
Single-molecule fluorescence in-situ hybridization reveals that human SHANK3 mRNA expression varies during development and in autism-associated SHANK3 heterozygosity.Deletions and mutations in the SHANK3 gene are strongly associated with autism spectrum disorder and underlie the autism-associated disorder Phelan-McDermid syndrome. SHANK3 is a scaffolding protein found at the post-synaptic membrane of excitatory neurons.
Alexithymia and Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Complex Relationship.Alexithymia is a personality construct characterized by altered emotional awareness which has been gaining diagnostic prevalence in a range of neuropsychiatric disorders, with notably high rates of overlap with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the nature of its role in ASD symptomatology remains elusive. Here, we distill research at the intersection of alexithymia and ASD. After a brief synopsis of the studies that plaid a pioneering role in the identification of the overlapping fields between alexithymia and ASD, we comb the literature for evidence of its overlap with ASD in terms of prevalence, etiology, and behaviors. Through a formalized framework of the process of emotional interpretation and expression, we explore evidence for where and how deficits arise in this complex network of events. We portray how these relate to the dynamic interplay between alexithymic and autistic traits and find emerging evidence that alexithymia is both a cause and consequence of autistic behaviors. We end with a strategic proposal for future research and interventions to dampen the impacts of alexithymia in ASD.
The multiple faces of catatonia in autism spectrum disorders: descriptive clinical experience of 22 patients over 12 years.A retrospective review was conducted from the inpatient and outpatient records of twenty-two autistic youth presenting to a neurobehavioral service over a twelve-year period for combined psychiatric and behavioral pathology who also met DSM5 criteria for catatonia. Six autistic girls and 16 autistic boys ranging from ages eight to 26 years old were identified, and their variegated symptoms evaluated. Stereotypy, posturing, negativism, mutism and stupor were the most common catatonic symptoms, each present in more than half of the study patients. One patient had abnormal vital signs indicative of malignant catatonia. Twenty patients had concomitant repetitive self-injurious behaviors that had led to significant tissue injury and were refractory to psychotropic and behavioral interventions. The sample was weighted towards patients with severe self-injurious behavior, which often was the reason for admission. The many "faces" of catatonia in autism spectrum disorders are seen in this sample, and the novel recognition of repetitive self-injury as an under-recognized motor symptom of catatonia is highlighted. The preliminary findings in this study open many important future vistas for ongoing research regarding catatonia in ASDs.
Growth and weight status of Brazilian children with autism spectrum disorders: A mixed longitudinal study.This study examined the growth status and physical development of Brazilian children with autism spectrum disorders from 4 to 15 years of age. Furthermore, it was examined whether variation in growth patterns and weight status was influenced by the use of psychotropic medications.
Effectiveness of Virtual Reality for Children and Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder: An Evidence-Based Systematic Review.Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disease that is specially characterized by impairments in social communication and social skills. ASD has a high prevalence in children, affecting 1 in 160 subjects. Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as an effective tool for intervention in the health field. Different recent papers have reviewed the VR-based treatments in ASD, but they have an important limitation because they only use clinical databases and do not include important technical indexes such as the Web of Science index or the Scimago Journal &amp; Country Rank. To our knowledge, this is the first contribution that has carried out an evidence-based systematic review including both clinical and technical databases about the effectiveness of VR-based intervention in ASD. The initial search identified a total of 450 records. After the exclusion of the papers that are not studies, duplicated articles, and the screening of the abstract and full text, 31 articles met the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison and Outcomes) criteria and were selected for analysis. The studies examined suggest moderate evidence about the effectiveness of VR-based treatments in ASD. VR can add many advantages to the treatment of ASD symptomatology, but it is necessary to develop consistent validations in future studies to state that VR can effectively complement the traditional treatments.
A prebiotic intervention study in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).Different dietary approaches, such as gluten and casein free diets, or the use of probiotics and prebiotics have been suggested in autistic spectrum disorders in order to reduce gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances. GI symptoms are of particular interest in this population due to prevalence and correlation with the severity of behavioural traits. Nowadays, there is lack of strong evidence about the effect of dietary interventions on these problems, particularly prebiotics. Therefore, we assessed the impact of exclusion diets and a 6-week Bimuno® galactooligosaccharide (B-GOS®) prebiotic intervention in 30 autistic children.
Examining the Reversibility of Long-Term Behavioral Disruptions in Progeny of Maternal SSRI Exposure.Serotonergic dysregulation is implicated in numerous psychiatric disorders. Serotonin plays widespread trophic roles during neurodevelopment; thus perturbations to this system during development may increase risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. Epidemiological studies have examined association between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment during pregnancy and increased autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk in offspring. It is unclear from these studies whether ASD susceptibility is purely related to maternal psychiatric diagnosis, or if treatment poses additional risk. We sought to determine whether maternal SSRI treatment alone or in combination with genetically vulnerable background was sufficient to induce offspring behavior disruptions relevant to ASD. We exposed C57BL/6J or
The Importance of Adolescent Self-Report in Autism Spectrum Disorder: Integration of Questionnaire and Autonomic Measures.Anxiety and sensory symptoms are highly prevalent and meaningful in the daily lives of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Despite the importance of carefully measuring, researching, and treating these symptoms, current methods in ASD seldom include self-report. This study investigated the consistency of adolescent and parent reports of anxiety and auditory sensitivity in individuals with ASD, and examined their validity via comparisons with sympathetic arousal at baseline and in response to an auditory challenge. Fifty adolescent-parent dyads (n = 26 ASD, n = 24 typically developing; 12-16 years old; IQ>80) completed parallel versions of both anxiety and auditory hypersensitivity scales, which were compared to heart rate collected at rest and during an aversive noise task. Adolescents with ASD exhibited greater anxiety and auditory hypersensitivity than their peers, based on both self and parent report. Across groups, self-report was higher than parent report. In individuals with ASD, a significant relationship was found between self-reported anxiety and autonomic arousal at rest, and between self-reported auditory sensitivity and autonomic reactivity during the noise task. These relationships were not significant for parent-report. These findings extend past work by demonstrating greater self-reported (than parent-reported) anxiety and sensory symptoms. Furthermore, the presence of significant correlations between self-reported symptoms and sympathetic arousal supports the validity of self-report in adolescents with ASD with average or above average cognitive abilities. This indicates that adolescents with ASD have a unique perspective on their internal experience, which can complement parent reports and provide a more comprehensive assessment of symptoms in research and clinical settings.
The Dutch Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire: Psychometric properties of an autism-specific sensory sensitivity measure.Sensory sensitivity is common in autistic people and since the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.), hypo- and hyper-responsiveness to sensory stimuli are part of one of the criteria domains for an autism spectrum disorder classification. For scientific research and the clinical practice, one needs reliable and valid questionnaires that measure sensory sensitivity and can distinguish between hypo- and hyper-responsiveness. We translated the Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire into Dutch. The aim was to examine the psychometric properties and the clinical use of the Dutch Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire in 78 autistic and 68 typically developing adults (18-45 years; IQ > 70). Just like the original Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire, the Dutch Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire is a reliable and valid questionnaire. The Dutch Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire had reliable hypo- and hyper-responsiveness subscales, reasonable to good modality subscales and was stable over time. Moreover, using the 95th percentile of the typically developing group as cut-off, we showed that two thirds of the autistic adults had heightened sensory sensitivity. We also showed that hypo- and hyper-responsiveness do co-exist in both autistic and typically developing adults. In sum, we conclude that the Dutch Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire is suitable to be used in scientific research as well as in the clinical practice.
Meta-analysis of GABRB3 Gene Polymorphisms and Susceptibility to Autism Spectrum Disorder.Several lines of evidence have suggested that the GABA receptor subunit β3 (GABRB3) gene is a genetic contributor in the autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The aberrant expression of GABRB3 is reported in ASD patients which may be a consequence of the presence of certain genetic variants in the promoter region of the gene. The associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within this gene and ASD have been analyzed in previous studies. However, the results are conflicting. In the present study, we performed a meta-analysis on association between two SNPs located in the promoter region of GABRB3 gene (rs4906902 and rs20317) and ASD. The literature search was performed based on criteria provided by the meta-analysis of observational studies in epidemiology (MOOSE). The association between mentioned SNPs and ASD was calculated using pooled odd ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals. The result of the present meta-analysis indicates that neither rs4906902 nor rs20317 are significantly associated with the risk of ASD. The underlying mechanism of the aberrant expression of GABRB3 gene in ASD patients should be investigated in other biological levels.
The association of excitation and inhibition signaling with the relative symptom expression of autism and psychosis-proneness: Implications for psychopharmacology.The underlying mechanisms of autism and schizophrenia are poorly understood, partly due to a lack of dimension-specific research. Aberrant excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission are implicated in both conditions, particularly in social dysfunction. This study investigates the extent to which the degree of autistic tendency and psychosis-proneness exclusively and interactively predict excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter concentrations in the superior temporal cortex (STC). In 38 adults (18 male, 18-40 years), we obtained autistic tendencies (Autism-Spectrum Quotient [AQ]) and psychosis-proneness scores (Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire [PP]); magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) quantified glutamate and GABA+ concentrations from the STC. Results demonstrated a negative AQ/PP interaction with glutamate concentration for the left STC voxel, where PP increased with glutamate for average AQ, while AQ decreased with glutamate for average-high PP. There was a negative AQ/PP interaction with glutamate/GABA+ ratio for the right STC, AQ increasing with glutamate/GABA+ for low-average PP, while PP decreased with glutamate/GABA+ for high AQ. Consistent with animal studies, we also reveal that overall reduced glutamate/GABA+ ratio might be precipitated by increased right hemisphere GABA+ concentrations. These findings illustrate the importance of considering the concurrent effects of autism and psychosis dimensions on understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms implicated in either condition, and can advance psychopharmacological research into better treatment options for patients.
A rare exonic NRXN3 deletion segregating with neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions in a three-generation Chinese family.Members of the neurexin gene family, neurexin 1 (NRXN1), neurexin 2 (NRXN2), and neurexin 3 (NRXN3) encode important components of synaptic function implicated in autism and other neurodevelopmental/neuropsychiatric disorders. Loss of function variants have been reported predominantly in NRXN1, with fewer such variants detected in NRXN2 and NRXN3. Evidence for segregating NRNX3 variants has particularly been lacking. Here, we report identification by chromosomal microarray analysis of a rare exonic deletion affecting the NRXN3 alpha isoform in a three-generation Chinese family. The proband, a 7-year-old boy, presented with motor and language delay and met the clinical diagnostic criteria for autism. He also presented with moderate intellectual disability, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and facial dysmorphic features. The mother and maternal grandfather, both deletion carriers, presented with variable degrees of language and communication difficulties, as well as neuropsychiatric problems such as schizophrenia and temper tantrums. A compilation of sporadic cases with deletions involving part or all of NRXN3 revealed that 9 of 23 individuals (39%) displayed features of autism. The evidence for cosegregation in our family further supports a role for NRXN3 in autism and neurodevelopmental/neuropsychiatric disorders but demonstrates intrafamily variable expressivity due to this NRXN3 deletion, with schizophrenia and facial dysmorphism being potential novel features of NRXN3 haploinsufficiency.
Using a motion-tracking device to facilitate motion control in children with ASD for neuroimaging.Conducting neurological scans of children with disabilities is difficult because participants exhibit excessive motion. We examined whether a motion-tracking system that combined real-time visual feedback with positive reinforcement and shaping could facilitate motion control in two children with autism spectrum disorder.
Exploring autism symptoms in an Australian cohort of patients with Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes.Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) are neurodevelopmental disorders that are caused by abnormal expression of imprinted genes in the 15q11-13 region. Dysregulation of genes located in this region has been proposed as a susceptibility factor for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in both disorders.
Parents' Perceptions of the Oral Health-related Quality of Life of their Autistic Children in Iran.The aim of this study was to evaluate parents' perception of the oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) of autistic children in Iran, and to determine the quality of life of their families in relation to child' oral health status.
An exploration of the association between matrix reasoning and eating disturbance behavior in girls with autism spectrum disorder.Although there have been suggestions that central coherence may be associated with eating disturbances (EBD) in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), relatively little attention has been given to specific aspects of IQ and EDB.
Carnosine supplementation does not affect serum concentrations of advanced glycation and precursors of lipoxidation end products in autism: a randomized controlled clinical trial.Background Abundant evidence indicate the increased levels of oxidative stress in patients with autism. Advanced glycation end products and advanced lipoxidation end products and their precursors play a major role in increased oxidative stress in numerous metabolic and neurologic diseases. Carnosine is a natural dipeptide with antiglycation effects. The aim of this trial was to examine the effects of carnosine supplementation on the advanced glycation end products and the precursors of advanced lipoxidation end products in patients with autism. Method This randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted on 36 autistic children, 18 in the carnosine group and 18 in the placebo group. The groups received a daily supplement of 500 mg carnosine or placebo for two months, respectively. Plasma concentrations of glycation and precursors of lipoxidation markers were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Results In all, 63.9% of the autistic children had normal nutritional status. Carnosine supplementation did not significantly alter plasma concentrations of advanced glycation end products and precursors of advanced lipoxidation end products in autistic children. Conclusion The findings indicate that supplementation of carnosine could not change advanced glycation end products and precursor of advanced lipoxidation end products in autistic children.
A prospective natural history study of Krabbe disease in a patient cohort with onset between 6 months and 3 years of life.Krabbe disease is a rare neurodegenerative disorder caused by a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme galactocerebrosidase. Patients with Krabbe disease present with a variable disease course depending on their age of onset. The purpose of this prospective cohort study was to characterize the natural progression of Krabbe disease in a large group of patients with disease onset between 6 and 36 months of life who were evaluated with a standardized protocol.
Epileptic Encephalopathy and Autism: A Complex Interplay.Drug-resistant epileptic encephalopathy such as Dravet syndrome presents with autistic symptoms. Three cases with autism spectrum disorder with comorbid Dravet syndrome were assessed. All the cases presented with onset of seizures before a year and with autistic features. The patients responded to a combination of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), resulting in reduced frequency of seizures and behavioral issues. Contrary to the belief that both epilepsy and use of AEDs have adverse impact on the cognition of children with an early onset of epilepsy, we found improvement in the symptoms of our patients who presented with autism and epilepsy. Primary treatment approaches such as occupational therapy, special education, speech therapy, and behavioral therapy; effective diagnosis of comorbidities such as epilepsy; and aggressive treatment might help with behavioral improvement. Early diagnosis followed by treatment with AEDs can improve seizures, electroencephalography abnormalities, and behavioral problems.
Family history of immune conditions and autism spectrum and developmental disorders: Findings from the study to explore early development.Numerous studies have reported immune system disturbances in individuals with autism and their family members; however, there is considerable variability in findings with respect to the specific immune conditions involved, their timing, and the family members affected and little understanding of variation by autism subphenotype. Using data from the Study to Explore Early Development (SEED), a multi-site case-control study of children born 2003-2006 in the United States, we examined the role of family history of autoimmune diseases, asthma, and allergies in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as well as other developmental disorders (DD). We investigated maternal immune conditions during the pregnancy period, as well as lifetime history of these conditions in several family members (mother, father, siblings, and study child). Logistic regression analyses included 663 children with ASD, 984 children with DD, and 915 controls ascertained from the general population (POP). Maternal history of eczema/psoriasis and asthma was associated with a 20%-40% increased odds of both ASD and DD. Risk estimates varied by specific ASD subphenotypes in association with these exposures. In addition, children with ASD were more likely to have a history of psoriasis/eczema or allergies than POP controls. No association was observed for paternal history or family history of these immune conditions for either ASD or DD. These data support a link between maternal and child immune conditions and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, and further suggest that associations may differ by ASD phenotype of the child.

Making the future together: Shaping autism research through meaningful participation.Participatory research methods connect researchers with relevant communities to achieve shared goals. These methods can deliver results that are relevant to people's lives and thus likely to have a positive impact. In the context of a large and growing body of autism research, with continued poor implementation, and some evidence of community dissatisfaction, there is a powerful case for participatory autism research. In order to develop a framework for such collaborative working, a UK seminar series was organised and co-produced by autistic and non-autistic people with academic, practitioner and lived expertise. This article reports on the outcomes from the series, identifying five topics relevant to building a community of practice in participatory research: Respect, Authenticity, Assumptions, Infrastructure and Empathy. Each topic is connected to a specific example from within and beyond research, to inspire new practices in the field. We call for the development of participatory research skills among the autism research community and the facilitation of greater autistic leadership of, and partnership in, research. Such work, if delivered to a high standard, is likely to lead to better translation into practice and improved outcomes for autistic people and those who support them.
Katanin-like protein Katnal2 is required for ciliogenesis and brain development in Xenopus embryos.Microtubule remodeling is critical for cellular and developmental processes underlying morphogenetic changes and for the formation of many subcellular structures. Katanins are conserved microtubule severing enzymes that are essential for spindle assembly, ciliogenesis, cell division, and cellular motility. We have recently shown that a related protein, Katanin-like 2 (KATNAL2), is similarly required for cytokinesis, cell cycle progression, and ciliogenesis in cultured mouse cells. However, its developmental expression pattern, localization, and in vivo role during organogenesis have yet to be characterized. Here, we used Xenopus embryos to reveal that Katnal2 (1) is expressed broadly in ciliated and neurogenic tissues throughout embryonic development; (2) is localized to basal bodies, ciliary axonemes, centrioles, and mitotic spindles; and (3) is required for ciliogenesis and brain development. Since human KATNAL2 is a risk gene for autism spectrum disorders, our functional data suggest that Xenopus may be a relevant system for understanding the relationship of mutations in this gene to autism and the underlying molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis.
A comparative perspective on lateral biases and social behavior.Cerebral lateralization and associated motor behaviors were historically thought to be characteristics unique to humans. Today, it is clear that these features are present and visible in other animal species. These shared attributes of brain and behavior suggest inheritance from a distant common ancestor. Population-level motor biases are likely to reflect an early evolutionary division of primary survival functions of the brain's left and right hemispheres. In modern humans, these features may provide a foundational platform for the development of higher cognitive functions, inextricably cementing the ties between the evolution and development of cognition. This chapter focuses on the links between a vertebrate-wide right hemisphere dominance for perceiving and producing social signals, left side motor biases (inclusive of visual field preferences), and the evolution and development of cognition in modern humans.
Applying Eye Tracking to Identify Autism Spectrum Disorder in Children.Eye tracking (ET) holds potential for the early detection of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To overcome the difficulties of working with young children, developing a short and informative paradigm is crucial for ET. We investigated the fixation times of 37 ASD and 37 typically developing (TD) children ages 4-6 watching a 10-second video of a female speaking. ASD children showed significant reductions in fixation time at six areas of interest. Furthermore, discriminant analysis revealed fixation times at the mouth and body could significantly discriminate ASD from TD with a classification accuracy of 85.1%, sensitivity of 86.5%, and specificity of 83.8%. Our study suggests that a short video clip may provide enough information to distinguish ASD from TD children.
Oxytocin improves animal behaviors and ameliorates oxidative stress and inflammation in autistic mice.Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder which significantly impacts the quality of people's life. Oxytocin is a hormone impacting the social cognition and interpersonal trust. In this study, we aimed to explore the role of oxytocin in autism.
Comparing fully automated state-of-the-art cerebellum parcellation from magnetic resonance images.The human cerebellum plays an essential role in motor control, is involved in cognitive function (i.e., attention, working memory, and language), and helps to regulate emotional responses. Quantitative in-vivo assessment of the cerebellum is important in the study of several neurological diseases including cerebellar ataxia, autism, and schizophrenia. Different structural subdivisions of the cerebellum have been shown to correlate with differing pathologies. To further understand these pathologies, it is helpful to automatically parcellate the cerebellum at the highest fidelity possible. In this paper, we coordinated with colleagues around the world to evaluate automated cerebellum parcellation algorithms on two clinical cohorts showing that the cerebellum can be parcellated to a high accuracy by newer methods. We characterize these various methods at four hierarchical levels: coarse (i.e., whole cerebellum and gross structures), lobe, subdivisions of the vermis, and the lobules. Due to the number of labels, the hierarchy of labels, the number of algorithms, and the two cohorts, we have restricted our analyses to the Dice measure of overlap. Under these conditions, machine learning based methods provide a collection of strategies that are efficient and deliver parcellations of a high standard across both cohorts, surpassing previous work in the area. In conjunction with the rank-sum computation, we identified an overall winning method.
Clinical findings in cases with 9q deletion encompassing the 9q21.11q21.32 region.Tuğ E, Ergün MA, Perçin EF. Clinical findings in cases with 9q deletion encompassing the 9q21.11q21.32 region. Turk J Pediatr 2018; 60: 94-98. We report on a case with developmental delay and dysmorphic craniofacial features, and a novel~15.2 Mb interstitial deletion within 9q21.11q21.32 confirmed with array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). A twenty-two month old boy with inability to walk without support, absent speech, and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder was seen in our clinic. His craniofacial examination revealed relative macrocephaly, facial asymmetry, frontal bossing, sparse medial eyebrows, hypertelorism, broad base to nose, smooth philtrum, large mouth, operated cleft lip and wide spaced teeth. The high resolution binding (HRB) chromosome analysis revealed an interstitial deletion 46,XY,del(9)(q21) confirmed by aCGH revealing; 46,XY,der(9)(pter→q21.11::q21.32→qter).arr9q21.11q21.32(71,069,763-86,333,272)X1dn. Genotype-phenotype correlations of sixteen cases with 9q21 deletion having different breakpoints and variable length revealed common characteristic features including severe developmental delay, epilepsy, neuro-behavioural disorders and facial dysmorphism including hypertelorism, smooth philtrum and thin upper lip. The smallest overlapping deleted region in all defined cases to date including our case comprised four genes. Among these deleted genes as in our case, especially RORB is considered to be a strong candidate for neurological phenotype.
Are language features and emotion regulation related to maternal depression in autism and language delay?Language and communication are very important in child social, emotional and cognitive development. Delay in language is usually the first complaint for children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or developmental language delay (DLD). This study evaluated language features and emotion regulation skills in children diagnosed with ASD and DLD and their association with maternal depression.
Prenatal influenza vaccination rescues impairments of social behavior and lamination in a mouse model of autism.Prenatal infection is a substantial risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism in offspring. We have previously reported that influenza vaccination (VAC) during early pregnancy contributes to neurogenesis and behavioral function in offspring.
Altered Gamma Oscillations during Motor Control in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.Autism is hypothesized to result in a cortical excitatory and inhibitory imbalance driven by inhibitory interneuron dysfunction, which is associated with the generation of gamma oscillations. On the other hand, impaired motor control has been widely reported in autism. However, no study has focused on the gamma oscillations during motor control in autism. In the present study, we investigated the motor-related gamma oscillations in autism using magnetoencephalography. Magnetoencephalographic signals were recorded from 14 right-handed human children with autism (5 female), aged 5-7 years, and age- and IQ-matched 15 typically developing children during a motor task using their right index finger. Consistent with previous studies, the autism group showed a significantly longer button response time and reduced amplitude of motor-evoked magnetic fields. We observed that the autism group exhibited a low peak frequency of motor-related gamma oscillations from the contralateral primary motor cortex, and these were associated with the severity of autism symptoms. The autism group showed a reduced power of motor-related gamma oscillations in the bilateral primary motor cortex. A linear discriminant analysis using the button response time and gamma oscillations showed a high classification performance (86.2% accuracy). The alterations of the gamma oscillations in autism might reflect the cortical excitatory and inhibitory imbalance. Our findings provide an important clue into the behavioral and neurophysiological alterations in autism and a potential biomarker for autism.
Sex: A Significant Risk Factor for Neurodevelopmental and Neurodegenerative Disorders.Males and females sometimes significantly differ in their propensity to develop neurological disorders. Females suffer more from mood disorders such as depression and anxiety, whereas males are more susceptible to deficits in the dopamine system including Parkinson's disease (PD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism. Despite this, biological sex is rarely considered when making treatment decisions in neurological disorders. A better understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) underlying sex differences in the healthy and diseased brain will help to devise diagnostic and therapeutic strategies optimal for each sex. Thus, the aim of this review is to discuss the available evidence on sex differences in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders regarding prevalence, progression, symptoms and response to therapy. We also discuss the sex-related factors such as gonadal sex hormones and sex chromosome genes and how these might help to explain some of the clinically observed sex differences in these disorders. In particular, we highlight the emerging role of the Y-chromosome gene,
Maturation of GABAergic Transmission in Cerebellar Purkinje Cells Is Sex Dependent and Altered in the Valproate Model of Autism.Brain development is accompanied by a shift in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) response from depolarizing-excitatory to hyperpolarizing-inhibitory, due to a reduction of intracellular chloride concentration. This sequence is delayed in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). We now report a similar alteration of this shift in the cerebellum, a structure implicated in ASD. Using single GABA
Increased Axonal Bouton Stability during Learning in the Mouse Model of MECP2 Duplication Syndrome. duplication syndrome is an X-linked form of syndromic autism caused by genomic duplication of the region encoding methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2). Mice overexpressing
Oxytocin Enhancement of Emotional Empathy: Generalization Across Cultures and Effects on Amygdala Activity.Accumulating evidence suggests that the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) can enhance empathy although it is unclear which specific behavioral and neural aspects are influenced, and whether the effects are modulated by culture, sex, and trait autism. Based on previous findings in Caucasian men, we hypothesized that a single intranasal dose of OXT would specifically enhance emotional empathy (EE) via modulatory effects on the amygdala in an Asian (Chinese) population and explored the modulatory role of sex and trait autism on the effects. We first conducted a double-blind, randomized between-subject design experiment using a modified version of the multifaceted empathy task to determine whether OXT's facilitation of EE can be replicated in Chinese men (
Diet Can Impact Microbiota Composition in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder.Diet is one of the most influential environmental factors in determining the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota. Microbial dysbiosis in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and the impact of some bacterial taxa on symptoms of ASD has been recognized. Children with ASD are often described as picky eaters with low intake of fiber-rich foods, including fruits and vegetables. However, the impact of diet on the microbiota composition in children with ASD is largely unknown. Herein, fecal samples, 3 day food diaries and the Youth and Adolescence Food Frequency questionnaire (YAQ) were collected from children with ASD (ASD;
Relationship Between Theory of Mind, Emotion Recognition, and Social Synchrony in Adolescents With and Without Autism.Difficulty in social communication and interaction is a primary diagnostic feature of ASD. Research has found that adolescents with ASD display various impairments in social behavior such as theory of mind (ToM), emotion recognition, and social synchrony. However, not much is known about the relationships among these dimensions of social behavior. Adolescents with and without ASD participated in the study. ToM ability was measured by viewing social animations of geometric shapes, recognition of facial emotions was measured by viewing pictures of faces, and synchrony ability was measured with a spontaneously arising interpersonal movement task completed with a caregiver and an intentional interpersonal task. Attention and social responsiveness were measured using parent reports. We then examined the relationship between ToM, emotion recognition, clinical measures of attention and social responsiveness, and social synchronization that arises either spontaneously or intentionally. Results indicate that spontaneous synchrony was related to ToM and intentional synchrony was related to clinical measures of attention and social responsiveness. Facial emotion recognition was not related to either ToM or social synchrony. Our findings highlight the importance of biological motion perception and production and attention for more fully understanding the social behavior characteristic of ASD. The findings suggest that the processes underlying difficulties in spontaneous synchrony in ASD are different than the processes underlying difficulties in intentional synchronization.
Regional volumetric abnormalities in pediatric autism revealed by structural magnetic resonance imaging.Autism is a group of complex neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by impaired social interaction, restricted and repetitive behavior. We performed a large-scale retrospective analysis of 1,996 structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations of the brain from 1,769 autistic and neurologically typically developing patients (aged 0-32 years), and extracted regional volumetric measurements distributed across 463 brain regions of each patient. The youngest autistic patients (<2.5 years) were diagnosed after imaging and identified retrospectively. Our study demonstrates corpus callosum volumetric abnormalities among autistic patients that are associated with brain overgrowth in early childhood (0-5 years old), followed by a shift towards known decreased volumes in later ages. Results confirm known increases in ventricular volumes among autistic populations and extends those findings to increased volumes of the choroid plexus. Our study also demonstrates distributed volumetric abnormalities among autistic patients that affect a variety of key regional white and grey matter areas of the brain potentially associated with known symptoms of autism.
Evaluating Efficacy and Preference for Prompt Type During Discrete-Trial Teaching.The components of discrete-trial teaching (DTT) may be individualized to each learner during instruction (e.g., the type of prompts used). However, there is limited research on the relative efficiency and effectiveness of these different prompt types. In addition, the learner's preference for how they are taught is not always considered. The present study compared relative effectiveness of three prompt types (i.e., a gesture, modeling, physical guidance) to a no-prompt control condition during a receptive identification task with three boys with autism. One participant met the mastery criterion first in the model prompt condition, and two participants in the physical prompt condition. All participants selected the physical prompt during a concurrent-chains preference assessment. In addition, all participants completed a chained task using the most effective prompt type.
Association of Maternal Insecticide Levels With Autism in Offspring From a National Birth Cohort.Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with a largely unknown etiology. To date, few studies have investigated prenatal exposure to toxins and risk of autism by using maternal biomarkers of exposure. Persistent organic pollutants are lipophilic halogenated organic compounds and include the insecticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), as well as its metabolite p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The objective of this study was to test whether elevated maternal levels of persistent organic pollutants are associated with autism among offspring.
Extraction Orthodontic Treatment in an Autistic Patient.Autism is a condition that restricts brain development. Early diagnostic criteria are as follows: less responsive to social stimuli, inability to develop natural speaking skills, lack of communication skills, and limited and repetitive behaviors. Orthodontic treatment is a challenging process for doctors in autistic patients. The clinical and cephalometric examination of a 17-year and 7-month-old autistic patient revealed class I malocclusion, increased vertical dimensions, proclined upper and lower incisors, and inconsistent lip closure. The treatment plan involved four premolar extractions from each quadrant. Upper and lower 1. premolar extraction with fixed treatment caused reduction in vertical dimensions and significant improvement in lip closure and incisor inclination. Due to the increased metabolic activity in these patients, treatment was completed in 13 months. As a result, autistic patients can be successfully treated. In this process, it is important to include communication as a major part of treatment.
The Use of Multi-parametric Biomarker Profiles May Increase the Accuracy of ASD Prediction.Effective biomarkers are urgently needed to facilitate early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), permitting early intervention, and consequently improving prognosis. In this study, we evaluate the usefulness of nine biomarkers and their association (combination) in predicting ASD onset and development. Data were analyzed using multiple independent mathematical and statistical approaches to verify the suitability of obtained results as predictive parameters. All biomarkers tested appeared useful in predicting ASD, particularly vitamin E, glutathione-S-transferase, and dopamine. Combining biomarkers into profiles improved the accuracy of ASD prediction but still failed to distinguish between participants with severe versus mild or moderate ASD. Library-based identification was effective in predicting the occurrence of disease. Due to the small sample size and wide participant age variation in this study, we conclude that the use of multi-parametric biomarker profiles directly related to autism phenotype may help predict the disease occurrence more accurately, but studies using larger, more age-homogeneous populations are needed to corroborate our findings.
Parent descriptions of the presentation and management of anxiousness in children on the autism spectrum.The complex interaction between anxiety and autism has led to debate about the presentation of anxiety in individuals on the spectrum and questions about the extent to which traditional checklists assess the entire range of symptomatology. Moreover, studies to date have not explored how the presentation of anxiety may differ between settings. Through a combination of open-ended questions, closed questions and standardised measures, parents of 173 children (aged 6-13) on the autism spectrum provided (1) descriptors of their child's anxiety at home, school and in the community and (2) strategies used to reduce their child's anxiety in each setting. Over half (52.6%) felt their child was anxious at home, 77.6% at school and 76.2% in the community. Parents reported differing presentations of anxiety between settings, with the majority of descriptions relating to observable, behavioural changes (e.g. hides/shuts down, repetitive behaviours) rather than cognitive or physiological signs. Parents also reported using different strategies across settings. The use of open-ended questions allowed the identification of signs of anxiety not explored within traditional questionnaires and highlighted the potential for signs to vary across settings. This knowledge is critical to inform the development or adaptations of anxiety measures and interventions.
A comparison of the Avisoft (5.2) and Ultravox (2.0) recording systems: Implications for early-life communication and vocalization research.Alterations in early-life communicative behaviors are a common feature of neurodevelopmental conditions, such as autism and epilepsy. One method of investigating communication in murine models is through analyzing ultrasonic vocalizations. These vocalizations are commonly recorded with either the Avisoft or the Ultravox recording programs. However, since no study has compared whether the systems are equally sensitive, the findings in one program may not be reproducible in the other. To directly compare the two programs, we elicited vocalizations from male and female 129SvEvTac and C57BL/6 mouse pups via the maternal isolation paradigm, recording vocalizations simultaneously with both systems. We held the detection parameters identical for each system and found that there was only a medium correlation between Avisoft and Ultravox overall. Further analysis indicated that Avisoft detected more total vocalizations, as well as more vocalizations at the set frequencies of 50, 60, and 70 kHz than Ultravox, p <  .05. No statistically significant difference was present at 80 kHz. These findings demonstrate that different recording systems do not detect the same quantity of vocalizations as one another, even when detection parameters are congruent. Therefore, it may be useful to revisit previous negative results obtained with Ultravox and repeat the experiments using Avisoft. Ultimately, ultrasonic vocalizations are a valuable tool, capable of examining early-life phenotypes. However, a more thorough understanding of the relationships between recording systems is necessary to achieve a more comprehensive and reproducible assessment of vocalizing behaviors.
The Perineuronal 'Safety' Net? Perineuronal Net Abnormalities in Neurological Disorders.Perineuronal nets (PNN) are extracellular matrix (ECM) assemblies that preferentially ensheath parvalbumin (PV) expressing interneurons. Converging evidence indicates that PV cells and PNN are impaired in a variety of neurological disorders. PNN development and maintenance is necessary for a number of processes within the CNS, including regulation of GABAergic cell function, protection of neurons from oxidative stress, and closure of developmental critical period plasticity windows. Understanding PNN functions may be essential for characterizing the mechanisms of altered cortical excitability observed in neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders. Indeed, PNN abnormalities have been observed in post-mortem brain tissues of patients with schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. There is impaired development of PNNs and enhanced activity of its key regulator matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in Fragile X Syndrome, a common genetic cause of autism. MMP-9, a protease that cleaves ECM, is differentially regulated in a number of these disorders. Despite this, few studies have addressed the interactions between PNN expression, MMP-9 activity and neuronal excitability. In this review, we highlight the current evidence for PNN abnormalities in CNS disorders associated with altered network function and MMP-9 levels, emphasizing the need for future work targeting PNNs in pathophysiology and therapeutic treatment of neurological disorders.
Dravet Syndrome: A Sodium Channel Interneuronopathy.Dravet Syndrome is a devastating childhood epilepsy disorder with high incidence of premature death plus comorbidities of ataxia, circadian rhythm disorder, impaired sleep quality, autistic-like social-interaction deficits and severe cognitive impairment. It is primarily caused by heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the
[Abnormal electroencephalogram features extraction of autistic children based on wavelet transform combined with empirical modal decomposition].Early detection and timely intervention are very essential for autism. This paper used the wavelet transform and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to extract the features of electroencephalogram (EEG), to compare the feature differences of EEG between the autistic children and healthy children. The experimental subjects included 25 healthy children (aged 5-10 years old) and 25 children with autism (20 boys and 5 girls aged 5-10 years old) respectively. The alpha, beta, theta and delta rhythm wave spectra of the C3, C4, F3, F4, F7, F8, FP1, FP2, O1, O2, P3, P4, T3, T4, T5 and T6 channels were extracted and decomposed by EMD decomposition to obtain the intrinsic modal functions. Finally the support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used to implement assessment of autism and normal classification. The results showed that the accuracy could reach 87% and which was nearly 20% higher than that of the model combining the wavelet transform and sample entropy in the paper. Moreover, the accuracy of delta (1-4 Hz) rhythm wave was the highest among the four kinds of rhythms. And the classification accuracy of the forehead F7 channel, left FP1 channel and T6 channel in the temporal region were all up to 90%, which expressed the characteristics of EEG signals in autistic children better.
Altered Auditory Processing, Filtering, and Reactivity in the Sensory processing, and auditory processing in particular, is altered in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The typical maturation of the auditory system is perturbed in these individuals during early development, which may underlie altered auditory reactivity that persists in later life. Of the many genes that regulate the auditory system development, loss-of-function mutations in the
Hydrogen-Rich Water Ameliorates Autistic-Like Behavioral Abnormalities in Valproic Acid-Treated Adolescent Mice Offspring.Due to its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects, recent research has demonstrated that molecular hydrogen can serve as a new medical approach for depression, anxiety and traumatic brain injury. However, its potential effects on neurodevelopmental diseases, such as autism are still elusive. The present study aims to investigate the potential effects of hydrogen-rich water (HRW) administration on valproic acid (VPA)-induced autistic-like behavioral deficits, and the associated underlying mechanism in adolescent mice offspring. Pregnant ICR mice were randomly divided into five groups (
Gyrification changes are related to cognitive strengths in autism.Behavioral, cognitive and functional particularities in autism differ according to autism subgroups and might be associated with domain-specific cognitive strengths. It is unknown whether structural changes support this specialization. We investigated the link between cortical folding, its maturation and cognitive strengths in autism subgroups presenting verbal or visuo-spatial peaks of abilities.
A Phenotype of Childhood Autism Is Associated with Preexisting Maternal Anxiety and Depression.This study explored whether ASD phenotypes in the child were associated with a history of anxiety or depression in the mother. We hypothesized that an ASD profile in children characterized by mild delays and increased rates of dysregulation would be associated with preexisting maternal anxiety or depression. Participants were 672 preschool children with ASD and their mothers. Children were classified as ASD after a comprehensive developmental evaluation. Mothers reported whether a healthcare provider ever diagnosed them with anxiety or depression before the birth of their child. Four child ASD phenotypes were derived from latent class analysis: Mild Language Delay with Cognitive Rigidity (Type 1), Significant Developmental Delay with Repetitive Motor Behaviors (Type 2), General Developmental Delay (Type 3), and Mild Language and Motor Delay with Dysregulation (i.e., aggression, anxiety, depression, emotional reactivity, inattention, somatic complaints, and sleep problems) (Type 4). Type 2 ASD served as the referent category in statistical analyses. Results showed that 22.6% of mothers reported a diagnosis of anxiety or depression before the birth of their child. Maternal anxiety or depression was associated with 2.7 times the odds (95% confidence interval: 1.4, 5.3) of Type 4 or Dysregulated ASD in the child; maternal anxiety and depression was associated with 4.4 times the odds (95% confidence interval: 1.4, 14.0) of Type 4 or Dysregulated ASD in the child. Our findings suggest an association between Dysregulated ASD in the child and anxiety and depression in the mother. These findings can enhance screening methods and inform future research efforts.
Management of Autistic Patients in Dental Office: A Clinical Update.Autism is an intellectual developmental disorder characterized by insidious disability in communication, social interaction, and using language and abstract concepts. This organic disorder is known to have deformities in brain, i.e., cerebellum and limbic system, showing wide spectrum of systemic and behavioral symptoms. The oral health care of such patients can be complicated as they cannot verbalize complaints about any dental problems they may be experiencing and can display a variety of behaviors and reactions to small changes also. This study summarizes etiology and diagnosis of this disorder with the special emphasis on the issues encountered while coping with children with autistic spectrum.
Long-Term Efficacy and Safety of Pediatric Prolonged-Release Melatonin for Insomnia in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.A recent double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study demonstrated 3-month efficacy and safety of a novel pediatric-appropriate prolonged-release melatonin (PedPRM) for insomnia in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and neurogenetic disorders (NGD) with/without attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder comorbidity. Long-term efficacy and safety of PedPRM treatment was studied.
Inhibition of GluN2A NMDA receptors ameliorates synaptic plasticity deficits in the Fmr1Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a genetic condition that is the most common form of inherited intellectual impairment and causes a range of neurodevelopmental complications including learning disabilities and intellectual disability and shares many characteristics with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In the FXS mouse model, Fmr1
Juvenile Shank3b deficient mice present with behavioral phenotype relevant to autism spectrum disorder.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a pervasive, multifactorial neurodevelopmental disorder diagnosed according to deficits in three behavioral domains: communication, social interaction, and stereotyped/repetitive behaviors. Mutations in Shank genes account for ∼1% of clinical ASD cases with Shank3 being the most common gene variant. In addition to maintaining synapses and facilitating dendritic maturation, Shank genes encode master scaffolding proteins that build core complexes in the postsynaptic densities of glutamatergic synapses. Male mice with a deletion of the PDZ domain of Shank3 (Shank3B KO) were previously shown to display ASD-like behavioral phenotypes with reported self-injurious repetitive grooming and aberrant social interactions. Our goal was to extend these previous findings and use a comprehensive battery of highly detailed ASD-relevant behavioral assays including an assessment of mouse ultrasonic communication carried out on key developmental days and male and female Shank3B KO mice. We demonstrate that ASD-related behaviors, atypical reciprocal social interaction and indiscriminate repetitive grooming, are apparent in juvenile stages of development of Shank3B KO mice. Our findings underscore the importance of utilizing Shank mutant models to understand the impact of this gene in ASD etiology, whichmay enable future studies focusing on etiological gene-environment interactions in ASD.
PAK2 Haploinsufficiency Results in Synaptic Cytoskeleton Impairment and Autism-Related Behavior.Synaptic cytoskeleton dysfunction represents a common pathogenesis in neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The serine/threonine kinase PAK2 is a critical regulator of cytoskeleton dynamics. However, its function within the central nervous system and its role in ASD pathogenesis remain undefined. Here, we found that Pak2 haploinsufficiency resulted in markedly decreased synapse densities, defective long-term potentiation, and autism-related behaviors in mice. Phosphorylation levels of key actin regulators LIMK1 and cofilin, together with their mediated actin polymerization, were reduced in Pak2
Cross-genetic determination of maternal and neonatal immune mediators during pregnancy.The immune system plays a fundamental role in development during pregnancy and early life. Alterations in circulating maternal and neonatal immune mediators have been associated with pregnancy complications as well as susceptibility to autoimmune and neurodevelopmental conditions in later life. Evidence suggests that the immune system in adults not only responds to environmental stimulation but is also under strong genetic control.
Prevalence of Psychotropic Medicine Use in Australian Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Drug Utilization Study Based on Children Enrolled in the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children.Based on data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children linked with pharmacy dispensing data from the Australian Government's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, we calculated the 1-year prevalence of psychotropic medicine supply in children and adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) as reported by parents in 2014. The majority of children and adolescents with ASD in Australia were not treated with psychotropic medicine. One-third had claims for at least one psychotropic medication, most commonly medications for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and antidepressants. Antipsychotics were supplied to less than one in twenty children and approximately one in ten adolescents. In line with findings from North America, psychotropic medicine was more often supplied to children and adolescents with ASD and comorbid ADHD.
Moderate Effects of Low-Intensity Behavioral Intervention.We compared clinical outcomes in a treatment group of 98 individuals who received between 8 and 15 weekly hours ( M = 10.6; SD = 1.7) of applied behavior analysis (ABA) intervention with a comparison group of 73 individuals who received another provision, including some ABA, (between 1.4-8 weekly hours, M = 5.7; SD = 1.6). After 2 years, the treatment group made greater gains than the comparison group on language and social skills, and other areas assessed by the Verbal Behavior Milestones Assessment and Placement Program (VB-MAPP). We evaluated the outcome on adaptive skills for a smaller sample of participants using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales II (VABS), but found no significant differences between the treatment ( n = 17) and comparison groups ( n = 11). Although the treatment group made important and clinically meaningful gains, the gains were moderate. These findings underline the importance of intervention intensity and provide further support for a dose-response relationship between ABA intervention hours and outcomes.
Regeneration of neurotransmission transcriptome in a model of epileptic encephalopathy after antiinflammatory treatment.Inflammation is an established etiopathogenesis factor of infantile spasms (IS), a therapy-resistant epileptic syndrome of infancy. We investigated the IS-associated transcriptomic alterations of neurotransmission in rat hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, how they are corrected by antiinflamatory treatments and whether there are sex differences. IS was triggered by repeated intraperitoneal administration of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid following anti-inflammatory treatment (adreno-cortico-tropic-hormone (ACTH) or PMX53) or normal saline vehicle to prenatally exposed to betamethasone young rats. We found that treatments with both ACTH and PMX53 resulted in substantial recovery of the genomic fabrics of all types of synaptic transmission altered by IS. While ACTH represents the first line of treatment for IS, the even higher efficiency of PMX53 (an antagonist of the complement C5a receptor) in restoring the normal transcriptome was not expected. In addition to the childhood epilepsy, the recovery of the neurotransmission genomic fabrics by PMX53 also gives hope for the autism spectrum disorders that share a high comorbidity with IS. Our results revealed significant sex dichotomy in both IS-associated transcriptomic alterations (males more affected) and in the efficiency of PMX53 anti-inflammatory treatment (better for males). Our data further suggest that anti-inflammatory treatments correcting alterations in the inflammatory transcriptome may become successful therapies for refractory epilepsies.
Induced pluripotent stem cells as a tool to study brain circuits in autism-related disorders.The mammalian brain is a very complex organ containing an estimated 200 billion cells in humans. Therefore, studying human brain development has become very challenging given all the data that are available from different approaches, notably genetic studies.Recent pluripotent stem cell methods have given rise to the possibility of modeling neurodevelopmental diseases associated with genetic defects. Fibroblasts from patients have been reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells to derive appropriate neuronal lineages. They specifically include different subtypes of cortical neurons that are at the core of human-specific cognitive abilities. The use of neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) has led to deciphering convergent and pleiotropic neuronal synaptic phenotypes found in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and their associated syndromes. In addition to these initial studies, remarkable progress has been made in the field of stem cells, with the major objective of reproducing the in vivo maturation steps of human neurons. Recently, several studies have demonstrated the ability of human progenitors to respond to guidance cues and signals in vivo that can direct neurons to their appropriate sites of differentiation where they become fully mature neurons.We provide a brief overview on research using human iPSC in ASD and associated syndromes and on the current understanding of new theories using the re-implantation of neural precursors in mouse brain.
"They Thought It Was an Obsession": Trajectories and Perspectives of Autistic Transgender and Gender-Diverse Adolescents.Despite research exploring autism in gender-diverse adolescents, no studies have elicited these individuals' perspectives. In-depth interviews with 22 well-characterized autistic gender-diverse adolescents revealed critical themes, including: recollections of pre-pubertal gender nonconformity; vivid experiences of gender dysphoria; a fear of social gender expression due to perceived animosity toward transgender people; and specific challenges that result from the interplay of gender diversity and neurodiversity. During the ~ 22 month study social gender affirmation increased in six participants and gender dysphoria attenuated in four participants. Given the ethical imperative to understand and prioritize the voiced perspectives and needs of autistic gender minority adolescents as well as the discovery of shared themes and experiences in this population, results should inform clinical research approaches and priorities.
[Psychological diagnosis of cognitive dysontogenesis].The article discusses a systematic clinical and psychological approach to different types of impaired cognitive development in children and adolescents with mental disorders in the context of the concept of cognitive dysontogenesis. The authors describe the types of cognitive dysontogenesis in schizophrenic and autistic spectrum disorders and present two models of its estimation: with complex psychometric and pathopsychological diagnosis and with a support on pathopsychological diagnosis of cognitive development only. Special attention is paid to domestic techniques developed in MHRC, which classify the types of cognitive dysontogenesis in children and adolescents with different disorders of mental development without reliance on psychometric indicators. The developed model of cognitive development profiles allows to make a conclusion about a typical picture of cognitive disorders in different versions of mental pathology.

Learning How to Make Friends for Chinese Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Randomized Controlled Trial of the Hong Kong Chinese Version of the PEERS® Intervention.This study examined the treatment efficacy of PEERS® (Program for the Education and Enrichment of Relational Skills) among Chinese adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in Hong Kong. The original PEERS® manual was translated into Chinese, and cultural adjustments were made according to a survey among 209 local adolescents in the general population. 72 high-functioning adolescents with ASD were randomly assigned to a treatment or waitlist control group. The 14-week parent-assisted training significantly improved social skills knowledge and social functioning, and also reduced autistic mannerisms. Treatment outcomes were maintained for 3 months after training and replicated in the control group after delayed treatment. The present study represents one of the few randomized controlled trials on PEERS® conducted outside North America.
KMT2A-rearranged infantile acute myeloid leukemia masquerading as juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.Mixed lineage leukemia [MLL; now known as lysine methyltransferase 2A (KMT2A)] rearrangement-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) are distinct diseases, although age of susceptibility (infancy or early childhood) and abnormal monocytosis are common clinical features. Here, we report two cases of KMT2A-rearranged infantile AML masquerading as JMML at initial presentation. Both cases showed leukocytosis accompanied by atypical monocytosis. However, in both cases, leukemic blasts were absent at the initial examination. Thus, a diagnosis of JMML was suspected. However, initial cytogenetic analysis revealed that both cases had an 11q23 rearrangement, which is atypical in JMML. Eventually, due to the emergence of leukemic blasts and further cytogenetic studies, both cases were diagnosed with infantile AML with a KMT2A rearrangement. Although one patient remains in complete remission after the completion of AML appropriate chemotherapy, the other died of AML due to treatment failure. Our experience suggests that AML with KMT2A rearrangement should be considered for the differential diagnosis of infantile cases with atypical monocytosis suggestive of JMML. Cytogenetic studies, including fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of KMT2A, may be helpful in distinguishing between AML with KMT2A rearrangement and JMML.
Behavioral and Socioemotional Development in Preterm Children.Prematurity is a significant risk factor for impaired neurodevelopmental outcomes. These include motor, cognitive, language, behavioral, and socioemotional competence. Long-term overall function depends on healthy socioemotional functioning. The vulnerability of the preterm brain during critical periods of development contributes to behavioral and socioemotional problems in preterm children. Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) clinical features are more frequent in preterm children compared with their full-term counterparts; however, true rates of ASD and ADHD vary across studies. Early detection of behavioral and socioemotional problems in preterm children would enable timely early intervention to improve long-term functional outcomes.
Dysregulated enzymatic antioxidant network in peripheral neutrophils and monocytes in children with autism.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder where immune cells play an important role. Oxidants and pro-inflammatory cytokines generated by innate immune cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ASD. Many previous reports have shown the role of various enzymatic antioxidants in the plasma/red blood cells of ASD subjects, however no study so far has evaluated them in peripheral immune cells of innate origin (neutrophils and monocytes) in ASD patients and typically developing control (TDC) children. With this background, our study explored the expression and activities of major enzymatic antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR) in peripheral neutrophils and monocytes of TDC/ASD subjects. Our data show that expression and activity of SOD is increased in ASD subjects as compared to TDC children in neutrophils and monocytes. On the other hand, GPx/GR activity is either reduced/unaltered in neutrophils and monocytes of ASD subjects as compared to TDC children. Increased SOD expression is associated with upregulated expression of nitrotyrosine (a marker of oxidant damage) in both innate immune cells of ASD subjects. Our study suggests that despite adaptive antioxidant response, there is an increased oxidative burden in peripheral neutrophils and monocytes of ASD subjects. This suggests that dysregulated enzymatic antioxidant network in peripheral innate immune cells could play a significant role in the pathogenesis of autism.
Developmental role of adenosine kinase for the expression of sex-dependent neuropsychiatric behavior.Deficits in social memory, cognition, and aberrant responses to stimulants are common among persons affected by schizophrenia and other conditions with a presumed developmental etiology. We previously found that expression changes in the adenosine metabolizing enzyme adenosine kinase (ADK) in the adult brain are associated with deficits in various cognitive domains. To distinguish between developmental and adult functions of ADK, we used two transgenic mouse lines with widespread disruption of ADK expression in the adult brain, but differences in the onset of ADK deletion. Specifically, we compared Nestin-Cre
Preschool predictors of reading ability in the first year of schooling in children with ASD.A high percentage of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) show elevated challenges in learning to read. We investigated longitudinal predictors of reading skills in 41 children diagnosed with ASD. All children completed measures of precursor literacy skills at the age of 4-5 years, including phonological awareness, letter sound knowledge, rapid automatic naming, name writing, and phonological memory (digit span), along with measures of word- and passage-level reading skills in their first year of formal schooling. Nonverbal cognition and letter sound knowledge accounted for 53.4% of the variance in regular single word reading at school age, with letter sound knowledge a significant individual predictor. Overall, 18 children showed reading ability scores in the average range on a standardized test of passage-level reading ability, whereas 23 children performed below expectations. These groups differed significantly on all precursor literacy measures (at ages 4-5), except autism symptoms based on parent report. Group membership was significantly predicted by preschool receptive vocabulary, name writing, and rapid automatic naming, with high sensitivity and specificity. These results are discussed in reference to the literature describing early literacy predictors for typically developing children, highlighting key areas for future intervention and support. Autism Res 2018, 11: 1332-1344. © 2018 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: Children with autism are at increased risk of persistent reading difficulties. We examined whether preschool reading-related skills linked to later reading ability. Performance on the following three tasks administered at preschool predicted children who showed early reading success versus below expectations in their first year of school: vocabulary, name writing, and rapid naming of familiar objects and shapes. These results can inform future interventions.

Amygdala and oxytocin functioning as keys to understanding and treating autism: Commentary on an RDoC based approach.The recent review by Hennessey, Andari and Rainnie (2018) utilizes the proposed Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) to classify amygdala functions and relate them to autism symptomatology. This approach has the potential to challenge the overarching autism diagnosis by furthering our knowledge of the mechanisms giving rise to autism psychopathology and generate novel treatment options. The purpose of this commentary is to provide additional information on a number of points raised in the review. Thus, (1) we discuss the issue of amygdala and brain overgrowth in children with autism and relate it to developmental oxytocin changes, (2) examine potential mechanisms that underlie amygdala overgrowth and dysfunction of the oxytocin system, (3) zoom in on the sexually dimorphic characteristics of the amygdala and potential parallels with the oxytocin system and (4) discuss how the interplay of oxytocin and vasopressin may explain the partially inconsistent findings of their effects on amygdala functioning.
A unified circuit for social behavior.Recent advances in circuit manipulation technologies have enabled the association of distinct neural circuits with complex social behaviors. The brain areas identified through historical anatomical characterizations as mediators of sexual and parental behaviors can now be functionally linked to adult social behaviors within a unified circuit. In vivo electrophysiology, optogenetics and chemogenetics have been used to follow the processing of social sensory stimuli from perception by the olfactory system to valence detection by the amygdala and mesolimbic dopamine system to integration by the cerebral and cerebellar cortices under modulation of hypothalamic neuropeptides. Further, these techniques have been able to identify the distinct functional changes induced by social as opposed to non-social stimuli. Together this evidence suggests that there is a distinct, functionally coupled circuit that is selectively activated by social stimuli. A unified social circuit provides a new framework against which synaptopathic autism related mutations can be considered and novel pharmacotherapeutic strategies can be developed.
The role of ARID1B, a BAF chromatin remodeling complex subunit, in neural development and behavior.Haploinsufficiency of the chromatin remodeling factor ARID1B leads to autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability. Several independent research groups, including our own, recently examined the effects of heterozygous deletion of Arid1b in mice and reported severe behavioral abnormalities reminiscent of autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disability as well as marked changes in gene expression and decreased body size. Arid1b heterozygous mice also display significant cortical excitatory/inhibitory imbalance due to altered GABAergic neuron numbers and impaired inhibitory synaptic transmission. Abnormal epigenetic modifications, including histone acetylation and methylation, are additionally associated with Arid1b haploinsufficiency in the brain. Treating adult Arid1b mutant mice with a positive GABA allosteric modulator, however, rescues multiple behavioral abnormalities, such as cognitive and social impairments, as well as elevated anxiety. While treating Arid1b haploinsufficient mice with recombinant mouse growth hormone successfully increases body size, it has no effect on aberrant behavior. Here we summarize the recent findings regarding the role of ARID1B in brain development and behavior and discuss the utility of the Arid1b heterozygous mouse model in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric research. We also discuss some of the opportunities and potential challenges in developing translational applications for humans and possible avenues for further research into the mechanisms of ARID1B pathology in the brain.
Visually Evoked Response Differences to Contrast and Motion in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.High-density electroencephalography (EEG) was used to examine the utility of the P1 event-related potential (ERP) as a marker of visual motion sensitivity to luminance defined low-spatial frequency drifting gratings in 16 children with autism and 16 neurotypical children. Children with autism displayed enhanced sensitivity to large, high-contrast low-spatial frequency stimuli as indexed by significantly shorter P1 response latencies to large vs. small gratings. The current study also found that children with autism had larger amplitude responses to large gratings irrespective of contrast. A linear regression established that P1 adaptive mean amplitude for large, high-contrast sinusoidal gratings significantly predicted hyperresponsiveness item mean scores on the Sensory Experiences Questionnaire for children with autism, but not for neurotypical children. We conclude that children with autism have differences in the mechanisms that underlie low-level visual processing potentially related to altered visual spatial suppression or contrast gain control.
Levels of peripheral Neuregulin 1 are increased in non-medicated autism spectrum disorder patients.Though schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are separate diseases, they have some common clinical manifestations and common pathogenic mechanisms. Numerous genes are associated with these conditions. Among these genes, Neuregulin-1 forms a risk for schizophrenia and some studies have shown polymorphism of this gene accompanies schizophrenia. NRG1 has a wide variety of functions, including neuronal migration, axon guidance, synaptic transmission, oligodendroglial maturation, and neurite outgrowth. To date, NRG1 levels have not been researched in ASD patients and considering the neurodevelopmental effects of NRG1, this study aimed to research the peripheral NRG1 levels in ASD patients. The study compared 32 ASD patients and 32 healthy controls. Serum NRG-1 levels were measured with ELISA. In ASD patients (mean ± SD, 10.80 ± 4.78 ng/ml), the NRG1 levels were found to be statistically significantly high compared to the health control group (mean ± SD, 6.92 ± 4.91 ng/ml) (p = 0.004). According to the results we obtained, NRG1 was shown to play a possible role in ASD pathogenesis. There is a need for advanced studies on the possible role of NRG1 in ASD patients. This study is significant as it is the first study to measure peripheral NRG1 in ASD patients.
Is there an "antisocial" cerebellum? Evidence from disorders other than autism characterized by abnormal social behaviours.The cerebellum is a hindbrain structure which involvement in functions not related to motor control and planning is being increasingly recognized in the last decades. Studies on Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) have reported cerebellar involvement on these conditions characterized by social deficits and repetitive motor behavior patterns. Although such an involvement hints at a possible cerebellar participation in the social domain, the fact that ASD patients present both social and motor deficits impedes drawing any firm conclusion regarding cerebellar involvement in pathological social behaviours, probably influenced by the classical view of the cerebellum as a purely "motor" brain structure. Here, we suggest the cerebellum can be a key node for the production and control of normal and particularly aberrant social behaviours, as indicated by its involvement in other neuropsychiatric disorders which main symptom is deregulated social behaviour. Therefore, in this work, we briefly review cerebellar involvement in social behavior in rodent models, followed by discussing the findings linking the cerebellum to those other psychiatric conditions characterized by defective social behaviours. Finally, possible commonalities between the studies and putative underlying impaired functions will be discussed and experimental approaches both in patients and experimental animals will also be proposed, aimed at stimulating research on the role of the cerebellum in social behaviours and disorders characterized by social impairments, which, if successful, will definitely help reinforcing the proposed cerebellar involvement in the social domain.
The impact of auditory rhythmic cueing on gross motor skills in children with autism.[Purpose] This study aimed to investigate the effect of auditory rhythmic cueing on gross motor skills in children with autism. [Participants and Methods] A total of 30 autistic children aged 8-10 years with mild to moderate autistic features participated in this study. They were randomly allocated to either the control group (n=15), which underwent a specially designed physical therapy program, or the study group (n=15), which underwent the same program in addition to gait training with rhythmic auditory stimulation. To provide rhythmic auditory stimulation, combination of a metronome beat set to the child's cadence and rhythmic cueing from the MIDI Cuebase musical program was used. Both groups received 3 sessions per week for 3 months. The Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency 2nd Edition was used to assess gross motor skills at baseline and after 3 months of intervention. [Results] The study found statistically significant improvements in bilateral coordination, balance, running speed and agility, and strength in both groups after treatment. Moreover, there were statistically significant differences between the 2 groups, with the study group showing better improvement in all outcome measures. [Conclusion] Gait training with auditory rhythmic cueing elicited a positive effect on the gross motor skills of children with autism.
The Human Gut Microbiome - A Potential Controller of Wellness and Disease.Interest toward the human microbiome, particularly gut microbiome has flourished in recent decades owing to the rapidly advancing sequence-based screening and humanized gnotobiotic model in interrogating the dynamic operations of commensal microbiota. Although this field is still at a very preliminary stage, whereby the functional properties of the complex gut microbiome remain less understood, several promising findings have been documented and exhibit great potential toward revolutionizing disease etiology and medical treatments. In this review, the interactions between gut microbiota and the host have been focused on, to provide an overview of the role of gut microbiota and their unique metabolites in conferring host protection against invading pathogen, regulation of diverse host physiological functions including metabolism, development and homeostasis of immunity and the nervous system. We elaborate on how gut microbial imbalance (dysbiosis) may lead to dysfunction of host machineries, thereby contributing to pathogenesis and/or progression toward a broad spectrum of diseases. Some of the most notable diseases namely
The effect of having a child with ADHD or ASD on family separation.The primary aim of this study was to estimate the risk of parental separation associated with having a child with ADHD or ASD when controlling for a large range of known risk factors for parental separation using Danish registries.
Psychosocial Treatments Targeting Anxiety and Depression in Adolescents and Adults on the Autism Spectrum: Review of the Latest Research and Recommended Future Directions.This synthesis of treatment research related to anxiety and depression in adolescents and adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) focuses on the scientific support for various forms of psychosocial interventions, useful adaptations to standard interventions, and engagement of candidate therapeutic mechanisms.
Relations between Touch Target Size and Drag Distance in Mobile Applications for Users with Autism Spectrum Disorders.In recent years, the development of mobile applications for people within the autism spectrum has proliferated to help enhance skills that could be diminished in users with this condition. However, the usability of these applications does not appear to be the focus of development because users with autism can have difficulty with fine motor skills. This article focuses on evaluating the optimal drag distance and the sizes of the interaction elements for users with Autism Spectrum Disorder. To accomplish this goal, a case study was conducted that involved 20 users with Autism Spectrum Disorder and 30 users with typical development, using a prototype generated and two applications for commercial use on 7-in. tablets. For both developed applications, a slight variation can be observed between the different groups of participants. In the interaction with Proyect@ Habilidades, the application has pictograms of 65 pixels and it has a maximum trailing distance of 340 pixels. Moreover, in Proyect@ Retratos, where there is a minimum deviation between users with levels of autism 1 and 2, it also has pictograms of 65 pixels but with a drag distance of 110 pixels. For this reason, according to the results, we suggest that in order to obtain better results in the interaction with applications aimed at users diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders, the applications should have pictograms of a range of 65 pixels with a drag interaction between 110 and 340 pixels. Considering in context a 7-in. tablet with a resolution of 1280 × 800 pixels.
Initiating joint attention use in infants at high-risk for autism spectrum disorder.Impairment in initiating joint attention (IJA) is associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children, although it is unclear when impairments arise. Due to the early development of IJA use and late diagnosis of ASD, groups at high-risk of ASD, such as infants with an older sibling with ASD (ASIBs) and infants with fragile X syndrome (FXS), provide opportunities to study early IJA behaviours for children who are later diagnosed with ASD. This study analysed these two groups to determine if IJA use differed compared with typically developing (TD) peers at 12 months and whether IJA was associated with later ASD outcomes.
Perceived social support and quality of life of parents of children with Autism.When examining the incidence of autism, however, children should not be considered independent of their parents, as this collection of disorders also affects the life of their family members. Having a disabled child affects the relationships with the family and friends, and the social and work life of families. The quality of life of these families is discussed in terms of financial aspects, health, support of family members, values, occupation, family relations, and individual support dimensions of developmental disabilities. However, there are very limited studies on the relationship between perceived social support and quality of life of parents of children with autism, and none of these has been conducted in Turkey.
Genome-Wide Association Study and Identification of Chromosomal Enhancer Maps in Multiple Brain Regions Related to Autism Spectrum Disorder.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex developmental disorder with strong genetic components involved. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of non-coding regulatory variants for complex diseases. To explore the roles of chromosomal enhancer regions in the pathogenesis of ASD, we conducted an integrative analysis of genome-wide association study (GWAS) and brain region related enhancer-gene networks for ASD. The GWAS data of ASD were driven from a published study, involving 7,387 ASD cases and 8,567 controls. The enhancer-gene networks of eight brain regions were used here. The GWAS of ASD was first merged respectively with the enhancer datasets of eight brain regions. Pathway enrichment analysis was then performed to detect ASD associated pathways based on the enhancer-related single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) of each brain region. We detected multiple genes with brain region specific or common association signals, such as PGM3 (P value = 1.93 × 10
Early Disruption of the Microbiome Leading to Decreased Antioxidant Capacity and Epigenetic Changes: Implications for the Rise in Autism.Currently, 1 out of every 59 children in the United States is diagnosed with autism. While initial research to find the possible causes for autism were mostly focused on the genome, more recent studies indicate a significant role for epigenetic regulation of gene expression and the microbiome. In this review article, we examine the connections between early disruption of the developing microbiome and gastrointestinal tract function, with particular regard to susceptibility to autism. The biological mechanisms that accompany individuals with autism are reviewed in this manuscript including immune system dysregulation, inflammation, oxidative stress, metabolic and methylation abnormalities as well as gastrointestinal distress. We propose that these autism-associated biological mechanisms may be caused and/or sustained by dysbiosis, an alteration to the composition of resident commensal communities relative to the community found in healthy individuals and its redox and epigenetic consequences, changes that in part can be due to early use and over-use of antibiotics across generations. Further studies are warranted to clarify the contribution of oxidative stress and gut microbiome in the pathophysiology of autism. A better understanding of the microbiome and gastrointestinal tract in relation to autism will provide promising new opportunities to develop novel treatment modalities.
Molecular Dissection of Neurobeachin Function at Excitatory Synapses.Spines are small protrusions from dendrites where most excitatory synapses reside. Changes in number, shape, and size of dendritic spines often reflect changes of neural activity in entire circuits or at individual synapses, making spines key structures of synaptic plasticity. Neurobeachin is a multidomain protein with roles in spine formation, postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor targeting and actin distribution. However, the contributions of individual domains of Neurobeachin to these functions is poorly understood. Here, we used mostly live cell imaging and patch-clamp electrophysiology to monitor morphology and function of spinous synapses in primary hippocampal neurons. We demonstrate that a recombinant full-length Neurobeachin from humans can restore mushroom spine density and excitatory postsynaptic currents in neurons of Neurobeachin-deficient mice. We then probed the role of individual domains of Neurobeachin by comparing them to the full-length molecule in rescue experiments of knockout neurons. We show that the combined PH-BEACH domain complex is highly localized in spine heads, and that it is sufficient to restore normal spine density and surface targeting of postsynaptic AMPA receptors. In addition, we report that the Armadillo domain facilitates the formation of filopodia, long dendritic protrusions which often precede the development of mature spines, whereas the PKA-binding site appears as a negative regulator of filopodial extension. Thus, our results indicate that individual domains of Neurobeachin sustain important and specific roles in the regulation of spinous synapses. Since heterozygous mutations in Neurobeachin occur in autistic patients, the results will also improve our understanding of pathomechanism in neuropsychiatric disorders associated with impairments of spine function.
Effect of the autism-associated lncRNA Shank2-AS on architecture and growth of neurons.The pathogenic mechanism of autism is complex, and current research has shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) may play important roles in this process. The antisense lncRNA of SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 2 (Shank2-AS) is upregulated in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), whereas the expression of its sense strand gene Shank2 is downregulated. In neuronal cells, Shank2-AS and Shank2 can form a double-stranded RNA and inhibit Shank2 expression. Overexpression of Shank2-AS decreases neurite numbers and lengths, thereby inhibiting the proliferation of neuronal cells and promoting their apoptosis. Overexpression of Shank2 inhibits the abovementioned effects of Shank2-AS, and transfection of a vector containing the 10th intron of Shank2 (Shank2-AS is reverse-transcribed from this region) also blocks the function of Shank2-AS. Shank2 small interfering RNA plays a role similar to Shank2-AS. Therefore, Shank2-AS is abnormally expressed in patients with ASD and may affect the structure and growth of neurons by regulating Shank2 expression, thereby facilitating the development of ASD.
Early-life stress impairs developmental programming in Cadherin 13 (CDH13)-deficient mice.Cadherin-13 (CDH13), a member of the calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecule family, has been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity (ADHD) disorders, but also to depression. In the adult brain, CDH13 expression is restricted e.g. to the presynaptic compartment of inhibitory GABAergic synapses in the hippocampus and Cdh13 knockout mice show an increased inhibitory drive onto hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, leading to a shift in excitatory/inhibitory balance. CDH13 is also moderating migration of serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus, establishing projections preferentially to the thalamus and cerebellum during brain development. Furthermore, CDH13 is upregulated by chronic stress as well as in depression, suggesting a role in early-life adaptation to stressful experience. Here, we therefore investigated the interaction between Cdh13 variation and neonatal maternal separation (MS) in mice.
Regulatory genes and pathways disrupted in autism spectrum disorders.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly prevalent and complex genetic disorder. The complex genetic make-up of ASD has been extensively studied and both common and rare genetic variants in up to 1000 genes have been linked to increased ASD risk. While these studies highlight the genetic complexity and begin to provide a window for delineating pathways at risk in ASD, the pathogenicity and specific contribution of many mutations to the disorder are poorly understood. Defining the convergent pathways disrupted by this large number of ASD-associated genetic variants will help to understand disease pathogenesis and direct future therapeutic efforts for the groups of patients with distinct etiologies. Here, we review some of the common regulatory pathways including chromatin remodeling, transcription, and alternative splicing that have emerged as common features from genetic and transcriptomic profiling of ASD. For each category, we focus on one gene (CHD8, FOXP1, and RBFOX1) that is significantly linked to ASD and functionally characterized in recent years. Finally, we discuss genetic and transcriptomic overlap between ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders.
Background cortisol versus social anxiety as correlates of HPA-axis recovery from stress in boys with Autism Spectrum Disorder.Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) show dysregulation of the expected Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis and elevated cortisol responses to stress and response patterns, but little has been reported regarding their recovery from stress in terms of cortisol concentrations. This response was investigated in a sample of 32 young males with ASD aged between 9 and 18 years (M = 14.3 yr, SD = 2.7 yr), using a standardised experimental protocol combined with individualised stressor and non-stressor tasks. Results indicated that about half of the sample demonstrated unexpected HPA axis response patterns, and that recovery from stress cortisol concentrations were significantly associated with a single symptom of Social Phobia and Morning cortisol. These findings suggest that one of the key diagnostic criteria for ASD may be strongly influential in the HPA axis responses of boys with ASD and that training regimesto assist them to form less fearful associations with their non-ASD peers may be central to the academic and social progress of these boys.
Failing, hacking, passing: Autism, entanglement, and the ethics of transformation.One of the most notable recent changes in autism science is the belief that autism is a heterogeneous condition with no singular essence. I argue that this notion of 'autistic heterogeneity' can be conceived as an 'agential cut' and traced to uncertainty work conducted by cognitive psychologists during the early 1990s. Researchers at this time overcame uncertainty in scientific theory by locating it within autism itself: epistemological uncertainty was interwoven with ontological indeterminacy and autism became heterogeneous and chance like, a condition determined by indeterminacy. This paper considers not only the conceptual significance of this move but also the impact upon forms of subjectivity. This analysis is undertaken by integrating the agential realism of Karen Barad with the historical ontology of Michel Foucault. I argue that these two approaches are, firstly, concerned with ontologies of emergence and, secondly, foreground the inherently ethical nature of change. As such these theories can be used to articulate an 'ethics of transformation'. I argue that the agential cut which brought about autistic heterogeneity is potentially problematic within an ethics of transformation, limiting the possibility of future change in subjectivity by imagining difference and resistance as properties of autism rather than the individual.
Structural neuroimaging as clinical predictor: A review of machine learning applications.In this paper, we provide an extensive overview of machine learning techniques applied to structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to obtain clinical classifiers. We specifically address practical problems commonly encountered in the literature, with the aim of helping researchers improve the application of these techniques in future works. Additionally, we survey how these algorithms are applied to a wide range of diseases and disorders (e.g. Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), autism, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, etc.) in order to provide a comprehensive view of the state of the art in different fields.
Compliance in autism: Self-report in action.Previous research indicates that autistic individuals are more likely to be bullied, and that they experience heightened anxiety and diminished self-esteem. These factors are known to predict heightened compliance, which is the tendency to agree with or carry out the requests and demands of others. This has a range of potentially serious consequences, particularly for an autistic person. This study utilised self-report (the Gudjonsson Compliance Scale) and behavioural measures of compliance (the door-in-the-face task) with 26 autistic and 26 typically developing adults. Participants also completed measures of early life bullying experiences, anxiety and self-esteem. Autistic participants were more compliant on both self-report and experimental tasks, and they reported more bullying experiences, higher anxiety and reduced self-esteem. Looking at both groups, bullying, anxiety and self-esteem were all correlated with self-reported compliance on the Gudjonsson Compliance Scale, yet only self-esteem was a unique predictor. None of these predictor variables related to behavioural compliance on the door in the face; nor did Gudjonsson Compliance Scale scores predict door-in-the-face performance, which may be better explained by situational and motivational factors. Findings have important implications for a range of real-life settings including requests made in the context of research, schools, the criminal justice system and the workplace.
Effect of visual stimuli of pain on empathy brain network in people with and without Autism Spectrum Disorder.The extent to which affective empathy is impaired in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) remains unclear, as some-but not all-previous neuroimaging studies investigating empathy for pain in ASD have shown similar activation levels to those of neurotypicals individuals. These inconsistent results could be due to the use of different empathy-eliciting stimuli. While some studies used pictures of faces exhibiting a painful expression, others used pictures of limbs in painful situations. In this study, we used fMRI to compare activation in areas associated with empathy processing (empathy network) for these two types of stimuli in 31 participants (16 with ASD, 15 controls). We found a group difference in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the thalamus when participants viewed stimuli of limbs in painful situations, but not when they viewed face stimuli with a painful expression. Both groups of participants activated their empathy network more when viewing pictures of limbs in painful situations than when viewing pictures of faces with a painful expression; this increased activation for limbs versus faces was significantly enhanced in controls relative to ASD participants, especially in the secondary somatosensory cortex (SII). Our findings suggest that empathy defect of people with ASD is contingent upon the type of stimuli used, and may be related to the level of Mirror Neuron System involvement, as brain regions showing group differences (IFG, SII) underlie embodiment. We discuss the potential clinical implications of our findings in terms of developing interventions boosting the empathetic abilities of people with ASD.
Comparative study on the independent and combined effects of omega-3 and vitamin B12 on phospholipids and phospholipase A2 as phospholipid hydrolyzing enzymes in PPA-treated rats as a model for autistic traits.Abnormal phospholipid metabolism is a major component of many neurodevelopmental disorders including autism. Oral administration of propionic acid (PPA) can produce behavioral abnormalities and biochemical features in rodents similar to those observed in autism and can thus be used as a model to understand impaired brain fatty acid metabolism in autism.
Brief Report: Do You See What I See? The Perception of Bullying in Male Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder.Although there is evidence to suggest that adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have difficulty interpreting complex social situations, little is known about their understanding of bullying. Given the high rates of victimization in this population, it is important to investigate how adolescents with ASD comprehend bullying. Male adolescents with ASD and IQ-matched typically-developing (TD) controls (M
Protection by tyrosine kinase inhibitor, tyrphostin AG126, through the suppression of IL-17A, RORγt, and T-bet signaling, in the BTBR mouse model of autism.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is an extremely predominant neurodevelopmental disorder expressed as impairment in reciprocal social interaction along with repetitive, restricted, and stereotyped behaviors. The protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, tyrphostin AG126 (AG126), regulates the expression of several genes that play an important role in the development of neuroinflammatory disorders. Here, we investigate the possible effects of AG126 (5 mg/kg daily through intraperitoneal injection) on self-grooming, marble burying, and hot plate test results in BTBR T + Itpr3tf/J mice (BTBR is a model of autism). We also explore the effects of AG126 administration on IL-17 A, RORγt, T-bet, and IFN-γ production in CD4
Prevalence of long-term health conditions in adults with autism: observational study of a whole country population.To investigate the prevalence of comorbid mental health conditions and physical disabilities in a whole country population of adults aged 25+ with and without reported autism.
University Students with Autism: The Social and Academic Experiences of University in the UK.The number of university students with autism is increasing, and it is crucial that these students can access adequate support. An online questionnaire was completed by 26 autistic students and 158 non-autistic students enrolled at UK universities to investigate social and academic experiences. Autistic students self-reported significant challenges and more mental health difficulties than non-autistic students. Significant challenges focused on the social components of university life, including social skills, social support opportunities, and levels of ASD awareness from others. Many strengths were also reported regarding academic skills of autistic university students. Importantly, there were more thoughts of withdrawal by the students with autism highlighting the need for support. These data can inform university student support services.
Parallel Development of Chromatin Patterns, Neuron Morphology, and Connections: Potential for Disruption in Autism.The phenotype of neurons and their connections depend on complex genetic and epigenetic processes that regulate the expression of genes in the nucleus during development and throughout life. Here we examined the distribution of nuclear chromatin patters in relation to the epigenetic landscape, phenotype and connections of neurons with a focus on the primate cerebral cortex. We show that nuclear patterns of chromatin in cortical neurons are related to neuron size and cortical connections. Moreover, we point to evidence that reveals an orderly sequence of events during development, linking chromatin and gene expression patterns, neuron morphology, function, and connections across cortical areas and layers. Based on this synthesis, we posit that systematic studies of changes in chromatin patterns and epigenetic marks across cortical areas will provide novel insights on the development and evolution of cortical networks, and their disruption in connectivity disorders of developmental origin, like autism. Achieving this requires embedding and interpreting genetic, transcriptional, and epigenetic studies within a framework that takes into consideration distinct types of neurons, local circuit interactions, and interareal pathways. These features vary systematically across cortical areas in parallel with laminar structure and are differentially affected in disorders. Finally, based on evidence that autism-associated genetic polymorphisms are especially prominent in excitatory neurons and connectivity disruption affects mostly limbic cortices, we employ this systematic approach to propose novel, targeted studies of projection neurons in limbic areas to elucidate the emergence and time-course of developmental disruptions in autism.
The feasibility and appropriateness of a peer-to-peer, play-based intervention for improving pragmatic language in children with autism spectrum disorder.This study trialled a play-based, peer-to-peer intervention with children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to identify suitable instruments for measuring changes in pragmatic language following the intervention, and evaluate preliminary effectiveness. It also aimed to investigate the appropriateness of the intervention for participants.
Quantitative proteomics of forebrain subcellular fractions in fragile X mental retardation 1 knockout mice following acute treatment with 2-Methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine: Relevance to developmental study of schizophrenia.The fragile X mental retardation 1 knockout (Fmr1 KO) mouse replicates behavioral deficits associated with autism, fragile X syndrome, and schizophrenia. Less is known whether protein expression changes are consistent with findings in subjects with schizophrenia. In the current study, we used liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) proteomics to determine the protein expression of four subcellular fractions in the forebrains of Fmr1 KO mice vs. C57BL/6 J mice and the effect of a negative allosteric modulator of mGluR5-2-Methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP)-on protein expression. Strain- and treatment-specific differential expression of proteins was observed, many of which have previously been observed in the brains of subjects with schizophrenia. Western blotting verified the direction and magnitude of change for several proteins in different subcellular fractions as follows: neurofilament light protein (NEFL) and 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNP) in the total homogenate; heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins C1/C2 (HNRNPC) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D0 (HNRNPD) in the nuclear fraction; excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) and ras-related protein rab 3a (RAB3A) in the synaptic fraction; and ras-related protein rab 35 (RAB35) and neuromodulin (GAP43) in the rough endoplasmic reticulum fraction. Individuals with FXS do not display symptoms of schizophrenia. However, the biomarkers that have been identified suggest that the Fmr1 KO model could potentially be useful in the study of schizophrenia.
The Severe End of the Spectrum: Insights and Opportunities from the Autism Inpatient Collection (AIC).Research on individuals severely affected by autism, including those who are minimally verbal, have intellectual disability or challenging behaviors, has become less common. The Autism Inpatient Collection (AIC) was initiated so data on this group is available to the research community. Ten studies utilizing phenotypic data from the first 350 AIC participants are presented. Greater autism severity, sleep disturbance, and psychiatric disorders are risks for hospitalization; fluently verbal youth experience more depression and oppositional symptoms; lower adaptive/coping skills are associated with increased problem behaviors; lower IQ is a risk for SIB; post-traumatic and suicidal symptoms are common; and challenging behaviors improve with specialized inpatient treatment. A new measure of emotion regulation and prescribing practices are described and future research discussed.
Anxiety and depression in adults with autism spectrum disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis.Adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are thought to be at disproportionate risk of developing mental health comorbidities, with anxiety and depression being considered most prominent amongst these. Yet, no systematic review has been carried out to date to examine rates of both anxiety and depression focusing specifically on adults with ASD. This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the rates of anxiety and depression in adults with ASD and the impact of factors such as assessment methods and presence of comorbid intellectual disability (ID) diagnosis on estimated prevalence rates. Electronic database searches for studies published between January 2000 and September 2017 identified a total of 35 studies, including 30 studies measuring anxiety (n = 26 070; mean age = 30.9, s.d. = 6.2 years) and 29 studies measuring depression (n = 26 117; mean age = 31.1, s.d. = 6.8 years). The pooled estimation of current and lifetime prevalence for adults with ASD were 27% and 42% for any anxiety disorder, and 23% and 37% for depressive disorder. Further analyses revealed that the use of questionnaire measures and the presence of ID may significantly influence estimates of prevalence. The current literature suffers from a high degree of heterogeneity in study method and an overreliance on clinical samples. These results highlight the importance of community-based studies and the identification and inclusion of well-characterized samples to reduce heterogeneity and bias in estimates of prevalence for comorbidity in adults with ASD and other populations with complex psychiatric presentations.
Co-occurrence of Gomez-Lopez-Hernandez syndrome and Autism Spectrum Disorder: Case report with review of literature.We report on Gomez-Lopez-Hernandez syndrome (GLHS) in a Caucasian patient, Georgian, 36 months, male, only child born to non-consanguineous parents. There were no similar cases in the family and among close relatives. MRI study confirmed rhombencephalosynapsis (fusion of cerebellar hemispheres in combination with the agenesis of cerebellar vermis) and mild dilation of the lateral ventricles. Other main findings are bilateral parieto-temporal alopecia and brachiturricephaly (broad skull shape and tower-like elongation of the cranium in the vertical axis), low-set posteriorly retracted ears, strabismus (in the right eye), hypotonia (Beighton scale score - 6) and ataxia (trouble maintaining balance). Patient has no signs of trigeminal anesthesia, no recurrent, painless eye infections, corneal opacities and ulcerated wounds on the facial skin and buccal mucosa were observed. Based on the scientific literature we suggest a finding of brachiturricephaly in addition to rhombencephalosynapsis and bilateral alopecia sufficient to put a diagnosis of GLHS. Patient did not speak, disregarded guardians and clinician addressing him, did not make eye contact, was restless and occasionally displayed aggression and self-injurious behavior. These symptoms confirm the earlier diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Therefore, the current study describes a case of co-occurrence of GLHS and ASD.
Immunological Dysfunction in Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Potential Target for Therapy.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with an unknown etiology and currently few effective therapies. Immune system alterations have being demonstrated in ASD, both in humans and via animal models; immune imbalance thus arises as a possible pathway for drug intervention. In this review, the studies were classified into 2 major groups: (1) clinical research whose authors classify therapies with primary anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory actions, making use of: sulforaphane, celecoxib, lenalidomide, pentoxifylline, spironolactone, flavonoid luteolin, corticosteroids, oral immunoglobulin, intravenous immunoglobulin, cell therapy, dialyzable lymphocyte extracts, minocycline, and pioglitazone; and (2) other ASD therapies already used or currently under study whose initial characteristics were neither anti-inflammatory nor immunomodulatory initially, but displayed a capacity for immunomodulation throughout the treatment: risperidone, vitamin D, omega-3, Ginkgo biloba, L-carnosine, N-acetylcysteine, and microbiome restoration. These studies used various data acquisition methodologies. Questions arose such the need for randomized and placebo-controlled studies with greater numbers of participants as well as the use of biomarkers to refine the treatment of autistic subjects.
Charisma and the clinic.Here we argue that 'charisma', a concept widely taken up within geography and the environmental humanities, is of utility to the social studies of medicine. Charisma, we suggest, draws attention to the affective dimensions of medical work, the ways in which these affective relations are structured, and the manner in which they are intimately tied to particular material-discursive contexts. The paper differentiates this notion of charisma from Weber's analyses of the 'charismatic leader' before detailing three forms of charisma - ecological (which relates to the affordances an entity has), corporeal (related to bodily interaction) and aesthetic (pertaining to an entity's initial visual and emotional impact). Drawing on interview data, we then show how this framework can be used to understand the manner in which psychologists and neuroscientists have come to see and act on autism. We conclude the article by suggesting that examining charisma within healthcare settings furthers the concept, in particular by drawing attention to the discursive features of ecologies and the 'non-innocence' of charisma.
A Developmental Study of Abnormal Behaviors and Altered GABAergic Signaling in the VPA-Treated Rat Model of Autism.Although studies have investigated the role of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic signaling in rodent neural development and behaviors relevant to autism, behavioral ontogeny, as underlain by the changes in GABAergic system, is poorly characterized in different brain regions. Here, we employed a valproic acid (VPA) rat model of autism to investigate the autism-like behaviors and GABAergic glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) expression underlying these altered behaviors in multiple brain areas at different developmental stages from birth to adulthood. We found that VPA-treated rats exhibited behavioral abnormalities relevant to autism, including delayed nervous reflex development, altered motor coordination, delayed sensory development, autistic-like and anxiety behaviors and impaired spatial learning and memory. We also found that VPA rats had the decreased expression of GAD67 in the hippocampus (HC) and cerebellum from childhood to adulthood, while decreased GAD67 expression of the temporal cortex (TC) was only observed in adulthood. Conversely, GAD67 expression was increased in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) from adolescence to adulthood. The dysregulated GAD67 expression could alter the excitatory-inhibitory balance in the cerebral cortex, HC and cerebellum. Our findings indicate an impaired GABAergic system could be a major etiological factor occurring in the cerebral cortex, HC and cerebellum of human cases of autism, which suggests enhancement of GABA signaling would be a promising therapeutic target for its treatment.
Prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder in a large Italian catchment area: a school-based population study within the ASDEU project.AimsThis study aims to estimate Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) prevalence in school-aged children in the province of Pisa (Italy) using the strategy of the ASD in the European Union (ASDEU) project.
Autism Research: An Objective Quantitative Review of Progress and Focus Between 1994 and 2015.The nosology and epidemiology of Autism has undergone transformation following consolidation of once disparate disorders under the umbrella diagnostic, autism spectrum disorders. Despite this re-conceptualization, research initiatives, including the NIMH's Research Domain Criteria and Precision Medicine, highlight the need to bridge psychiatric and psychological classification methodologies with biomedical techniques. Combining traditional bibliometric co-word techniques, with tenets of graph theory and network analysis, this article provides an objective thematic review of research between 1994 and 2015 to consider evolution and focus. Results illustrate growth in Autism research since 2006, with nascent focus on physiology. However, modularity and citation analytics demonstrate dominance of subjective psychological or psychiatric constructs, which may impede progress in the identification and stratification of biomarkers as endorsed by new research initiatives.
Small cells with big implications: Microglia and sex differences in brain development, plasticity and behavioral health.Brain sex differences are programmed largely by sex hormone secretions and direct sex chromosome effects in early life, and are subsequently modulated by early life experiences. The brain's resident immune cells, called microglia, actively contribute to brain development. Recent research has shown that microglia are sexually dimorphic, especially during early life, and may participate in sex-specific organization of the brain and behavior. Likewise, sex differences in immune cells and their signaling in the adult brain have been found, although in most cases their function remains unclear. Additionally, immune cells and their signaling have been implicated in many disorders in which brain development or plasticity is altered, including autism, schizophrenia, pain disorders, major depression, and postpartum depression. This review summarizes what is currently known about sex differences in neuroimmune function in development and during other major phases of brain plasticity, as well as the current state of knowledge regarding sex-specific neuroimmune function in psychiatric disorders.
Reduction in social anxiety after MDMA-assisted psychotherapy with autistic adults: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study.Standard therapeutic approaches to reduce social anxiety in autistic adults have limited effectiveness. Since 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy shows promise as a treatment for other anxiety disorders, a blinded, placebo-controlled pilot study was conducted.
The Prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorders in Adult Psychiatric Inpatients: A Systematic Review.Whilst the prevalence of autism spectrum disorders in adults within the community setting is well-established, less is known about the prevalence among adults based within a psychiatric inpatient setting.
Mind the gut: probiotics in paediatric neurogastroenterology.The gut-brain axis has recently emerged as a key modulator of human health and the intestinal microbiome has a well-recognised pivotal role in this strong connection. The aim of this narrative review is to update and summarise the effect and clinical applicability of probiotics in paediatric neurogastroenterology. The Cochrane Database and PubMed were searched using keywords relating to different subtypes of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) and their symptoms, those relating to the CNS and related neurological or behavioural dysfunction as well as 'probiotic' OR 'probiotics'. Included papers were limited to those including children (aged 0-18 years) and using English language. Although significant effects of specific strains have been reported in infants with FGIDs, heterogeneity amongst the studies (different products and concentrations used and FGID subtypes), has limited the ability to draw an overall conclusion on the clinical value of probiotics. According to different meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials, the use of Lactobacillus reuteri (DSM 17938) was associated with a significant decrease in average crying time in infantile colic. There is moderate evidence for this strain and LGG and limited evidence (based on one study each) for the beneficial effect of VSL#3 and a three-strain bifidobacteria mix in abdominal pain FGIDs, particularly in the irritable bowel disease subgroup of children, but not in functional dyspepsia. There is currently no clear evidence of positive effects of oral probiotics in autistic spectrum disorder. Efficacy and safety of other strains or beneficial effects in other conditions still need to be proven, as probiotic properties are strain-specific, and data cannot be extrapolated to other brain-gut or mood diseases or to other probiotics of the same or different species. To transform the use of probiotics from a tempting suggestion to a promising treatment modality in neurogastroenterological disorders more accurate differentiation of the efficacy-proven strains, clarification of dose, duration, and outcome and a careful selection of the target patients are still necessary.
[Aging in people with autism spectrum disorder].Autism spectrum disorder is characterized by a qualitative alteration in social interaction and communication associated with restricted interests and stereotyped behaviors. This condition will accompany people throughout their lives, with variations in their evolution. Our objectives were to know the evolutionary characteristics of people with autistic spectrum disorder, analyzing cognitive, behavioral, health, mortality and their needs in the aging stage, which will guide the planning of specific support resources. We analyze studies related to the evolution in adult life in people with this disorder, with or without identified entities, and socio-health conditions that should be considered in the aging process. The knowledge about aging in people with autism is still scarce and it is difficult to define a specific pattern because this will depend, among other factors, on the etiology, the degree, the presence of intellectual disability and/or epilepsy, and the scope in where live, which can even condition the life expectancy. Aging has been associated with mood disorders, depression, deterioration in executive functions and episodic memory, although it is difficult to differentiate it from natural aging in people with typical development. The identification of a specific entity will allow to know the possible evolution and prevent complications in syndromes that may be associated with autism: fragile X, Down, Angelman, Rett and Williams, for that reason we rank the genetic and neurological consultation.
Living a tormented life: Caregivers' experiences of caring for a child with autism in Northeastern Thailand.Caring for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be a demanding challenge to caregivers. The aim of this study was to learn what caring for children with ASD means to caregivers who live in rural Thailand. A hermeneutic phenomenological approach was used to analyze narrative data from interviews of five caregivers. Three themes emerged: (a) being sensitive to the word autism, (b) being trapped in a tunnel of distress, and (c) being the universe for the child. Healthcare professionals need to be sensitive to the caregivers' cultural customs in order to meet their expectations in a respectful way.
The neuropathological investigation of the brain in a monkey model of autism spectrum disorder with ABCA13 deletion.The precise biological etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the neuropathology of a monkey model of autism Human ABCA13 is the largest ABC transporter protein, with a length of 5058 amino acids and a predicted molecular weight of >450 kDa. However, the function of this protein remains to be elucidated. This protein is thought to be associated with major psychiatric disease. Using this monkey model of autism with an ABCA13 deletion and a mutation of 5HT2c, we neuropathologically investigated the changes in the neuronal formation in the frontal cortex. As a result, the neuronal formation in the cortex was found to be disorganized with regard to the neuronal size and laminal distribution in the ABCA13 deletion monkey. The catecholaminergic and GABAergic neuronal systems, serotoninergic neuronal formation (5HT2c) were also found to be impaired by an immunohistochemical evaluation. This study suggested that ABCA13 deficit induces the impairment of neuronal maturation or migration, and the function of the neuronal network. This protein might thus play a role in the neurodevelopmental function of the central nervous system and the dysfunction of this protein may be a pathophysiological cause of mental disorders including autism.
Enhancing Low-Intensity Coaching in Parent Implemented Early Start Denver Model Intervention for Early Autism: A Randomized Comparison Treatment Trial.Short-term low intensity parent implemented intervention studies for toddlers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have found it difficult to demonstrate significantly improved developmental scores or autism severity compared to community treatment. We conducted a randomized comparative intent-to-treat study of a parent implemented intervention to (1) test the effects of an enhanced version on parent and child learning, and (2) evaluate the sensitivity to change of proximal versus distal measures of child behavior. We randomized 45 children with ASD, 12-30 months of age, into one of two versions of parent-implemented Early Start Denver Model (P-ESDM), the basic model, in which we delivered 1.5 h of clinic-based parent coaching weekly, and an enhanced version that contained three additions: motivational interviewing, multimodal learning tools, and a weekly 1.5-h home visit. We delivered the intervention for 12 weeks and measured child and parent change frequently in multiple settings. We found a time-by-group interaction: parents in the enhanced group demonstrated significantly greater gains in interaction skills than did parents in the non-enhanced group. Both interventions were associated with significant developmental acceleration; however, child outcomes did not differ by group. We found a significant relationship between degree of change in parental interaction skill and rate of children's improvement on our proximal measure. Parents in both groups reported satisfaction with the intervention. These findings suggest that parent skills improved more in the enhanced group than the comparison group. Children in the two groups showed similar improvements. Rate of individual parent learning was associated with greater individual child progress on a measure quite proximal to the treatment, though not on standardized assessments.
Distractor Inhibition in Autism Spectrum Disorder: Evidence of a Selective Impairment for Individuals with Co-occurring Motor Difficulties.Although most researchers agree that individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) exhibit atypical attention, there is little consensus on the exact nature of their deficits. We explored whether attentional control in ASD varies as a function of motor proficiency. Nineteen children with ASD and 26 typically-developing controls completed the Movement Assessment Battery for Children and two ocular motor tasks requiring them to generate a saccade toward, and fixate, a visual target in the presence or absence of a distractor. The ASD group demonstrated poorer accuracy than typically-developing controls when distractors were present. Importantly, however, ASD symptomology was only related to poorer accuracy in individuals with motor difficulties. These findings suggest that distractor inhibition may be selectively impaired in this subgroup.
Beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN) as a genetically simple model of multifaceted neuropathology resulting from defects in autophagy.Autophagy is an essential and conserved cellular homeostatic process. Defects in the core and accessory components of the autophagic machinery would most severely impact terminally differentiated cells, such as neurons. The neurodevelopmental/neurodegenerative disorder β-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN) resulted from heterozygous or hemizygous germline mutations/pathogenic variant of the X chromosome gene WDR45, encoding WD40 repeat protein interacting with phosphoinositides 4 (WIPI4). This most recently identified subtype of the spectrum of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation diseases is characterized by a biphasic mode of disease manifestation and progression. The first phase involves early-onset of epileptic seizures, global developmental delay, intellectual disability and autistic syndrome. Subsequently, Parkinsonism and dystonia, as well as dementia, emerge in a subacute manner in adolescence or early adulthood. BPAN disease phenotypes are thus complex and linked to a wide range of other neuropathological disorders. WIPI4/WDR45 has an essential role in autophagy, acting as a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate binding effector that participates in autophagosome biogenesis and size control. Here, we discuss recent updates on WIPI4's mechanistic role in autophagy and link the neuropathological manifestations of BPAN's biphasic infantile onset (epilepsy, autism) and adolescent onset (dystonic, Parkinsonism, dementia) phenotypes to neurological consequences of autophagy impairment that are now known or emerging in many other neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. As monogenic WDR45 mutations in BPAN result in a large spectrum of disease phenotypes that stem from autophagic dysfunctions, it could potentially serve as a simple and unique genetic model to investigate disease pathology and therapeutics for a wider range of neuropathological conditions with autophagy defects.
Microbiota-gut-brain research: a critical analysis.Microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) research is a fast-growing field of inquiry with important implications for how human brain function and behaviour are understood. Researchers manipulate gut microbes ('microbiota') to reveal connections between intestinal microbiota and normal brain functions (e.g., cognition, emotion, memory) or pathological states (e.g., anxiety and mood disorders, neural developmental disorders such as autism). Many claims are made about causal relationships between gut microbiota and human behaviour. By uncovering these relationships, MGB research aims to offer new explanations of mental health and potential avenues of treatment.So far, limited evaluation has been made of MGB's methods and its core experimental findings, many of which are extensively reiterated in copious reviews of the field. These factors, plus the self-help potential of MGB, have combined to encourage uncritical public uptake of MGB discoveries. Both social and professional media focus on the potential for dietary intervention in mental health, and causal relationships are assumed to be established.Our target article has two main aims. One is to examine critically the core practices and findings of experimental MGB research, and to raise questions about them for brain and behavioural scientists who may not be familiar with the field. The other is to challenge the way in which MGB findings are presented. Our positive goal is to suggest how current problems and weaknesses may be addressed, in order for both scientific and public audiences to gain a clearer picture of MGB research and its strengths and limitations.
An acoustic study of lexical stress contrastivity in children with and without autism spectrum disorders.In this exploratory study, we examined stress contrastivity within real word productions elicited via picture naming in 20 children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and 20 typical peers group-wise matched on age and vocabulary. Targets had a dominant pattern of lexical stress beginning with a strong-weak pattern (SW: 'caterpillar', 'butterfly') or a non-dominant pattern of lexical stress beginning with a weak-strong pattern (WS: 'tomato', 'potato'). Children produced each target twice (n = 320 productions). Acoustic measures were made for the duration, fundamental frequency, and intensity of the first two vowels for each word production. For vowel duration and fundamental frequency, children with ASD and typical peers produced a similar magnitude of stress contrastivity for SW and WS words. However, there was a significant group difference in the way contrastivity in intensity was realised for WS words whereby children with ASD produced less stress contrastivity than typical peers. Bayesian analyses were in line with our interpretation of our frequentist analyses.
Vitamin D and health in the Mediterranean countries.Vitamin D, traditionally well known for its role in maintaining optimal health through its contribution to calcium metabolism and skeletal health, has received increased attention over the past two decades, with considerable focus being placed on its nonskeletal benefits. This paper is a narrative review of the nonskeletal health benefits of vitamin D, of particular interest to inhabitants of Mediterranean countries, namely, autism, cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dental caries, diabetes mellitus, erectile dysfunction, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, respiratory tract infections, all-cause mortality, and pregnancy and birth outcomes, because of the relatively high incidence and/or prevalence of these disorders in this region. Currently, the best evidence is coming out of observational studies related to serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations. Vitamin D clinical trials have generally been poorly designed and conducted, usually being based on vitamin D dose rather than 25(OH)D concentration. The optimal 25(OH)D concentration is above 75 nmol/l (30 ng/ml), with even better health outcomes in the range of 100-150 nmol/l. Achieving these concentrations with vitamin D
When do Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder Take Common Ground into Account During Communication?One feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a deficit in verbal reference production, that is, providing an appropriate amount of verbal information for the listener to refer to things, people, and events. However, very few studies have manipulated whether individuals with ASD can take a speaker's perspective to interpret verbal reference. A critical limitation of all interpretation studies is that comprehension of another's verbal reference required the participant to represent only the other's visual perspective. Yet, many everyday interpretations of verbal reference require knowledge of social perspective (i.e., a consideration of which experiences one has shared with which interlocutor). We investigated whether 22 5;0-7;11-year-old children with ASD and 22 well-matched typically developing (TD) children used social perspective to comprehend (Study 1) and produce (Study 2) verbal reference. Social perspective-taking was manipulated by having children collaboratively complete activities with one of two interlocutors such that for a given activity, one interlocutor was Knowledgeable and one was Naïve. Study 1 found no between-group differences for the interpretation of ambiguous references based on social perspective. In Study 2, when producing referring terms, the ASD group made modifications based on listener needs, but this effect was significantly stronger in the TD group. Overall, the findings suggest that high-functioning children with ASD know with which interlocutor they have previously shared a given experience and can take this information into account to steer verbal reference. Nonetheless, they show clear performance limitations in this regard relative to well-matched controls. Autism Res 2018, 11: 1366-1375. © 2018 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: No one had studied if young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) could take into account previous collaboration with particular conversation partners to drive how well they communicate with others. In both their language understanding and spoken language, we found that five to 7-year-olds with ASD were able to consider what they had previously shared with the conversation partner. However, they were impaired when compared to typically developing children in the degree to which they tailored their spoken language for a specific listener.
"We were on our own": Mothers' experiences navigating the fragmented system of professional care for autism.Autism is a developmental disorder that emerges in early childhood. Treatments for autism span a wide variety of professionals and paraprofessionals in the medical and educational realms. This article draws on data from a survey of 620 parents of autistic children, including 385 written narratives, to examine the experiences of mothers as they engage with this fragmented system of professional care for children with autism. Findings suggest that engagement with treatments sent families into a complex and confusing universe of diagnosis and treatment. The fragmentation of autism's professional jurisdiction between the medical and educational systems meant that mothers struggled to find comprehensive professional care that met the standards recommended by leading medical research organizations. Many mothers found it necessary to reduce their workforce participation in order to obtain and maintain their children's treatment regimes, a phenomenon that transcended social class. However, the consequences of reducing work had differential impacts on families. While married and high socioeconomic status mothers were more insulated from the potential negative effects of losing one partner's income, single and low SES mothers experienced greater precarity. These findings connect the structure and arrangement of professional jurisdictions to the experiences of parents, suggesting ways that the fragmentation of professional care for autism can have negative impacts for women, single mothers, and low SES families.
Further evidence of a causal association between AGO1, a critical regulator of microRNA formation, and intellectual disability/autism spectrum disorder.Among the many regulators of microRNA formation, Argonaute 1 (AGO1) plays critical roles in RNA interference, which controls a wide range of biological activities. Recent large-scale genomic studies have identified at least five patients with intellectual disability/autism spectrum disorder who had de novo mutations in AGO1, but detailed clinical information was not available. The recognizable clinical features that are associated with AGO1 mutations remain to be determined. The proposita was a 15-year-old girl with diffuse hypotonia, infrequent seizures, and intellectual disability with an intelligence quotient of 41. She had characteristic facial features consisting of telecanthus, wide nasal bridge with bulbous nasal tip, and a round face with downslanted palpebral fissures. Serial computed tomography scans showed progressive calcification in the globus pallidus that became evident during childhood. A whole exome analysis in trio revealed a de novo heterozygous mutation in AGO1, i.e., c.595G > A p.(Gly199Ser). The distinctive facial features, i.e., telecanthus, wide nasal bridge with bulbous nasal tip, and a round face with downslanted palpebral fissures, closely resembled previously reported patients who had a chromosomal microdeletion encompassing AGO1 locus. The combinatory phenotype of such characteristic facial features and radiographic features, i.e. progressive calcification in the globus pallidus, in the presently reported patient suggest that AGO1 mutations lead to a syndromic form of intellectual disability/autism spectrum disorder. Distinctive facial features with early and progressive calcification in the globus pallidus may be suggestive of the presence of AGO1 mutations.
The Role of Vitamin D in Brain Health: A Mini Literature Review.Vitamin D is vital for our body as it regulates calcium homeostasis and maintains bone integrity. In this article, we will discuss how vitamin D aids in the function of neuronal and glial tissue and the many health consequences in a person with vitamin D deficiency. Some of the effects of vitamin D deficiency that will be discussed include the development of dementia caused by the increase of cerebral soluble and insoluble amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides and a decrease of its anti-inflammatory/antioxidant properties, the link to depression by a reduction of the buffering of increased calcium in the brain, and vitamin D deficiency in expecting mothers linking to the development of autism and schizophrenic-like disorders, hypoxic brain injury, and other mental illnesses. Lastly, we will discuss how vitamin D deficiency is linked to the development of diabetes mellitus, its role in neuronal development and a decrease of microglial inflammatory function leading to increased brain infections.
"I'm not in this alone" the perspective of parents mediating a physical activity intervention for their children with autism spectrum disorder.Web-based, parent-mediated interventions have shown to be beneficial for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in a variety of domains. We aimed to examine how parents of children with ASD perceive mediating a physical activity intervention delivered via a private Facebook group.
Selected Psychological Aspects of Meat Consumption-A Short Review.Eating meat is deeply entrenched in Western culture. It is often associated with wealth and a highly nutritional diet; and for many people it is also an established habit that is difficult to change. The second half of the 20th century was a period of rapid growth in meat consumption, which resulted in intensified meat production. At the same time, eating meat has recently become subject to criticism for health-related, environmental or humanitarian reasons. This review aims to signal the potential consequences of a change of diet or switching to diets that are rich/poor in certain ingredients on the functioning of the hormonal and nervous system, which translates into changes in mood and behavior. This paper discusses the psychological phenomena which underlie the difficulty of changing one's food preferences and problems encountered while adding new products to the daily diet. Finally, this study summarizes the limitations of modifying eating habits that have resulted from established attitudes and habits.
Investigation of Copy Number Variation by arrayCGH in Turkish Children and Adolescents Diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorders.The development of whole-genome screening methodologies for the detection of copy number variations (CNVs), such as array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCHG), provides a much higher resolution than karyotyping leading to the identification of novel microdeletion and microduplication syndromes often associated with an autism spectrum disease (ASD) phenotype. The aim of the study was to determine CNVs of patients with ASD by using array-based comparative genomic hybridization.

Biochemical and Morphological Characterization of a Neurodevelopmental Disorder-Related Mono-ADP-Ribosylhydrolase, MACRO Domain Containing 2.MACRO Domain Containing 2 (MacroD2) is a neurodevelopmental disorder-related mono-ADP-ribosylhydrolase. Molecular features of this protein in neural tissues are largely unknown. In this study, we generated a specific antibody against MacroD2, and carried out expression and morphological analyses of the molecule during mouse brain development. In Western blotting, 2 MacroD2 isoforms with molecular masses of ∼70 and ∼75 kDa started to be expressed at embryonic day 16.5, reached the maximal level at postnatal day 8, and then gradually decreased through P30. In contrast, other isoforms with molecular masses of ∼110 and ∼140 kDa gradually increased during embryonic to postnatal development. In immunohistochemical analyses, MacroD2 was strongly detected in cortical neurons in layer II-V at P0 and P7, while the protein expression decreased significantly in the neurons at P30. Immunofluorescence analyses revealed that MacroD2 was mainly distributed in the soma and to a lesser extent in the axon and dendrite of immature primary cultured mouse hippocampal neurons. On the other hand, in the matured hippocampal neurons, while MacroD2 was detected in the soma, it displayed in dendrites a punctate distribution pattern with a partial colocalization with synaptic markers, synaptophysin, and PSD95. The obtained results indicate that MacroD2 is expressed and may have a physiological role in the central nervous system during brain development.
The Role of Grandparents in Supporting Families of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Family Systems Approach.A family systems approach is required to identify the needs of families of children with autism. This paper explores how grandparents support children with autism and their parents using a family systems perspective. A thematic analysis of eighteen semi-structured interviews was conducted with participants from nine families, capturing experiences of both parents' and grandparents'. Themes identified were family recalibrating; strengthening the family system; and current needs and future concerns of grandparents. The views of families indicated the overwhelming need to acknowledge the grandparental role in supporting families that strengthen the family system by supporting the needs of a child with autism. Findings revealed that grandfathers have a calming role in these families where children have significant behavioural difficulties.
A Survey of Knowledge and Beliefs regarding Autism in Speech-Language Pathologists in India.Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) are significant team members in the identification, assessment, and rehabilitation of children with autism. With a recent upsurge in the number of children with autism, there arises a need to examine SLPs knowledge and skills in identification and intervention of children with autism.
Development of the Observable Behaviors of Autism Spectrum Disorder Scale.The objective of this research was to develop a caregiver-reported clinical outcome assessment (COA) measure designed to assess observable behaviors of children, ages 4 to 12 years, with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) for supporting labeling claims of treatment benefit.
Motor dysfunction as research domain across bipolar, obsessive-compulsive and neurodevelopmental disorders.Although genuine motor abnormalities (GMA) are frequently found in schizophrenia, they are also considered as an intrinsic feature of bipolar, obsessive-compulsive, and neurodevelopmental disorders with early onset such as autism, ADHD, and Tourette syndrome. Such transnosological observations strongly suggest a common neural pathophysiology. This systematic review highlights the evidence on GMA and their neuroanatomical substrates in bipolar, obsessive-compulsive, and neurodevelopmental disorders. The data lends support for a common pattern contributing to GMA expression in these diseases that seems to be related to cerebello-thalamo-cortical, fronto-parietal, and cortico-subcortical motor circuit dysfunction. The identified studies provide first evidence for a motor network dysfunction as a correlate of early neurodevelopmental deviance prior to clinical symptom expression. There are also first hints for a developmental risk factor model of these mental disorders. An in-depth analysis of motor networks and related patho-(physiological) mechanisms will not only help promoting Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) Motor System construct, but also facilitate the development of novel psychopharmacological models, as well as the identification of neurobiologically plausible target sites for non-invasive brain stimulation.
Autism Spectrum Disorder and Transition-Aged Youth.This article discusses common issues surrounding transition to adulthood in youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We review recent evidence on co-occurring medical and mental health conditions and topics of education and employment, sexuality and relationships, independent living, and financial support.
Inactivation of Magel2 suppresses oxytocin neurons through synaptic excitation-inhibition imbalance.Prader-Willi and the related Schaaf-Yang Syndromes (PWS/SYS) are rare neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by overlapping phenotypes of high incidence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and neonatal feeding difficulties. Based on clinical and basic studies, oxytocin pathway defects are suggested to contribute disease pathogenesis but the mechanism has been poorly understood. Specifically, whether the impairment in oxytocin system is limited to neuropeptide levels and how the functional properties of broader oxytocin neuron circuits affected in PWS/SYS have not been addressed. Using cell type specific electrophysiology, we investigated basic synaptic and cell autonomous properties of oxytocin neurons in the absence of MAGEL2; a hypothalamus enriched ubiquitin ligase regulator that is inactivated in both syndromes. We observed significant suppression of overall ex vivo oxytocin neuron activity, which was largely contributed by altered synaptic input profile; with reduced excitatory and increased inhibitory currents. Our results suggest that dysregulation of oxytocin system goes beyond altered neuropeptide expression and synaptic excitation inhibition imbalance impairs overall oxytocin pathway function.
Improved Socio-Emotional and Behavioral Functioning in Students with Autism Following School-Based Smartglasses Intervention: Multi-Stage Feasibility and Controlled Efficacy Study. Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) commonly demonstrate prominent social communication deficits, symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and chronic irritability. These challenges hinder academic progress and frequently persist despite educational, behavioral, and medical interventions. An assistive smartglasses technology may aid these individuals, especially if the technology is efficacious in ecologically-valid school settings. This study explored the feasibility and efficacy of Empowered Brain, a computerized smartglasses intervention designed as a socio-emotional behavioral aid for students with ASD.
Activation of autophagy rescues synaptic and cognitive deficits in fragile X mice.Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most frequent form of heritable intellectual disability and autism. Fragile X (
Delayed autism spectrum disorder recognition in children and adolescents previously diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.Phenotypic elements of autism spectrum disorder can be masked by attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms, potentially leading to a misdiagnosis or delaying an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis. This study explored differences in the age of autism spectrum disorder diagnosis between participants with previously diagnosed attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder versus autism spectrum disorder-only respondents. Children and adolescents, but not adults, initially diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder received an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis an average of 1.8 years later than autism spectrum disorder-only children, although the findings regarding the adult sample should be interpreted with caution. Gender differences were also explored, revealing that the delay in receiving an autism diagnosis was 1.5 years in boys and 2.6 years in girls with pre-existing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, compared with boys and girls without prior attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. No significant gender differences were observed in the adult sample. We argue that overlapping symptoms between autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder might delay a formal diagnosis of autism either by leading to a misdiagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or by making it difficult to identify the presence of co-occurring autism spectrum disorder conditions once an initial diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder has been obtained. Current findings highlight the need to recruit multidimensional and multidisciplinary screening procedures to assess for potential emerging autism spectrum disorder hallmarks in children and adolescents diagnosed or presenting with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms.
Links between sensory processing, adaptive behaviours, and attention in children with autism spectrum disorder: A systematic review.Atypical sensory processing has been described in autism spectrum disorder. The goal of this systematic review is to investigate the links between sensory processing, adaptive behaviours, and attention skills in children with autism spectrum disorder. The PRISMA guidelines were followed and a search was conducted using electronic databases: Medline, PsychInfo and Eric. Among the 11 studies about sensory processing that were selected, 7 investigated the association with adaptive behaviours and 5 with attention. Atypical sensory processing was reported in 82% to 97% of the participants with ASD, depending on the study. This review found a significant impact of sensory abnormalities on adaptive behaviour. In addition, we found interrelations between sensory processing and attention skills. However, the current literature is too limited to definitively conclude the direction of these interactions and the theories concerning perceptive functioning are conflicting.
Autism Spectrum Disorder and Neonatal Serum Magnesium Levels in Preterm Infants.Premature birth is associated with increased risk of autism spectrum disorder. Antenatal maternal magnesium administration is known to reduce subsequent risk of cerebral palsy including among premature infants, suggesting a potentially broader neuroprotective role for magnesium. Our objective was to determine whether magnesium could be protective against autism spectrum disorders in premature infants. A cohort of 4855 preterm children was identified, magnesium levels from 24 to 48 hours of life recorded, and subsequent autism spectrum disorder status determined. Adjusted relative risk of autism spectrum disorder with each 1 mg/dL increase in neonatal magnesium level was 1.15 (95% confidence interval: 0.86-1.53). Analysis of variance indicated that magnesium levels varied by gestational age and maternal antenatal magnesium supplementation, but not autism spectrum disorder status (
Fetal and Infancy Growth Pattern, Cord and Early Childhood Plasma Leptin, and Development of Autism Spectrum Disorder in the Boston Birth Cohort.Leptin is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in energy homeostasis. Emerging evidence suggests that leptin levels are altered in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD); however, this has not been studied prospectively. Rapid growth during infancy and early childhood has been implicated in ASD, but the evidence is inconsistent. As leptin is involved in growth and is a potential risk factor for ASD, we explored the associations between (a) cord, early childhood leptin and ASD; and (b) birth weight for gestational age, early childhood weight gain, and ASD. We also assessed the mediating role of leptin in the relationship between weight gain during infancy and ASD. This study was conducted in a sample of 822 subjects from the Boston Birth Cohort. ASD was defined from diagnostic codes in electronic medical records. Extremely rapid weight gain during infancy was associated with a greater ASD risk and this persisted after adjusting for potential confounders (aOR: 3.11; 95% CI: 1.37, 7.07). Similarly, children that had higher plasma leptin levels, prior to ASD diagnosis, had an increased ASD risk in both unadjusted and adjusted models (aOR: 7.87; 95% CI: 2.06, 30.04). Further, early childhood leptin indirectly mediated the relationship between rapid weight gain and ASD. No associations were found between birth weight for gestational age, cord leptin and risk of ASD. Our findings provide a basis to further explore whether the combination of early life growth pattern and a biomarker such as leptin can predict ASD earlier. Autism Res 2018, 11: 1416-1431. © 2018 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: Is early life growth and a biomarker leptin related to ASD risk? To answer this question, we followed 822 children from birth and found that those who gained weight very quickly in infancy, had higher leptin levels in early childhood, had a greater chance of later ASD diagnosis. More research is needed to see if infant's weight gain pattern along with a biomarker (such as leptin) can be used to identify children with ASD sooner.
The contribution of [1H] magnetic resonance spectroscopy to the study of excitation-inhibition in autism.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects over 1:100 of the population and costs the UK more than £32bn and the USA more than $175bn (£104bn) annually. Its core symptoms are social and communication difficulties, repetitive behaviours and sensory hyper- or hypo-sensitivities. A highly diverse phenotypic presentation likely reflects its etiological heterogeneity and makes finding treatment targets for ASD challenging. In addition, there are no means to identify biologically responsive individuals who may benefit from specific interventions. There is hope however, and in this review we consolidate how findings from magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) add to the evidence that differences in the brain's excitatory glutamate and inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) balance may be both a key biomarker and a tractable treatment target in ASD.
Siblings' experiences of growing up with children with autism in Taiwan and the United Kingdom.A child's diagnosis of autism impacts their whole family, in both positive and negative ways, that may be influenced by cultural beliefs.
The Gut Microbiota and Dysbiosis in Autism Spectrum Disorders.There is a growing body of evidence indicating the gut microbiota influence neurodevelopment and behavior. The purposes of this review are to provide an overview of studies analyzing the microbiota and their metabolites in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and to discuss the possible mechanisms of action involved in microbial influence on the brain and behavior.
Angelman syndrome-associated point mutations in the ZnDeregulation of the HECT ubiquitin ligase UBE3A/E6AP has been implicated in Angelman syndrome as well as autism spectrum disorders. We and others have previously identified the 26S proteasome as one of the major UBE3A-interacting protein complexes. Here, we characterize the interaction of UBE3A and the proteasomal subunit PSMD4 (Rpn10/S5a). We map the interaction to the highly conserved Zn
Monoamine oxidase isoenzymes: genes, functions and targets for behavior and cancer therapy.Monoamine oxidase (MAO) catalyzes the oxidative deamination of monoamine neurotransmitters and dietary amines. Two pharmacological types with different substrate and inhibitor specificities were reported. Molecular cloning revealed that the two types of MAO were different genes expressed as different proteins with different functions. MAO A and B have identical intron-exon organization derived by duplication of a common ancestral gene thus they are termed isoenzymes. MAO A knockout mice exhibited aggression, the first clear evidence linking genes to behavior. MAO A KO mice exhibited autistic-like behaviors which could be prevented by reducing serotonin levels at an early developmental age (P1-P7) providing potential therapy. MAO B KO mice were non-aggressive and resistant to Parkinsongenic neurotoxin. More recently it was found that MAO A is overexpressed in prostate cancer and correlates with degree of malignancy. The oncogenic mechanism involves a ROS-activated AKT/FOXO1/TWIST1 signaling pathway. Deletion of MAO A reduced prostate cancer stem cells and suppressed invasive adenocarcinoma. MAO A was also overexpressed in classical Hodgkin lymphoma and glioma brain tumors. MAO B was overexpressed in glioma and non-small cell lung cancer. MAO A inhibitors reduce the growth of prostate cancer, drug sensitive and resistant gliomas and classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and enhance standard chemotherapy. Currently, we are developing NIR dye-conjugated clorgyline (MAO A inhibitor) as a novel dual therapeutic/diagnostic agent for cancer. A phase II clinical trial of MAO inhibitor for biochemical recurrent prostate cancer is ongoing. The role of MAO A and B in several cancer types opens new avenues for cancer therapies.
Brief Report: Flanker Visual Filtering Ability in Older Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder.Recent research has documented impaired ability to resist interference from visual distractors in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and suggests that this phenomenon may be more pronounced in young versus older children (Christ et al., Neuropsychology 25(6):690-701, 2011). The present study extends previous findings by examining visual filtering inhibitory ability within an older adolescent population. A flanker visual filtering task was administered to 36 adolescents with ASD and 44 adolescents without ASD (age: 11-20 years). Analysis revealed no evidence of group differences in visual filtering performance. Taken together with previous research, these results suggest that during early adolescence the previously observed impairment may resolve or compensatory strategies develop, allowing individuals with ASD to perform as well as their neurotypical peers.
Increasing paternal age alters anxiety-related behaviour in adult mice.Advanced paternal age (APA) is associated with an increased risk of adverse health outcomes in offspring, including autism and schizophrenia. In the present study, we investigated the behaviour of young (3-month-old; Control), middle aged (12 to 15-month-old; APA1) and old (24-month-old; APA2) C57BL/6J sires and their adult offspring. Male and female mice were tested at 10 weeks of age on a behavioural test battery including the elevated plus-maze, hole board, light/dark emergence, forced swim test, novelty-suppressed feeding and for prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response. Increasing the APA sire age to 24 months was shown to be associated with increased anxiety-related behaviour in the offspring, and indicated that increasing APA sire age produced a more robust hypoexplorative phenotype. Thus, increasing paternal age was associated with an increase in severity of an anxiogenic phenotype in their adult offspring. Ultimately, the results of these studies show that mouse models of APA are valuable for elucidating the mechanisms by which APA influences brain-related outcomes.
Weakness of visual working memory in autism.Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are often supported in daily life by visual presentations such as picture cards or illustrations. Therefore, they are considered to have visual strength. However, whether people with ASD are cognitively superior in visual processing and what causes the difference between visual and other sensory processing remain unknown. Thus, we compared visual and auditory processing from an aspect of memory in people with ASD and controls. We conducted the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) with 64 adults with ASD and 30 controls matched for gender, age, and Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FIQ). Our results showed that participants with ASD were inferior in visual working memory (P < .01), on a task in which a visual target was pointed every second. Another visual memory, namely, Visual Reproduction in which four geometric figures were presented each by 10 sec, and auditory memory, including working memory, revealed no significant differences between groups. Other visual memory, namely, Visual Paired Associates in which paired presentations were shown every 3 sec, had weak differences (P = .019). Thus, people with ASD might have difficulties processing rapid visual information. Autism Res 2018, 11: 1245-1252. © 2018 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: Autistic people are often supported by visual presentations. In this study, we inspected whether they have visual superiority. We showed that they were not visually superior in cognitive aspects, and were poor not at auditory but at visual working memory. Static visual memory in which memorization time is longer than that in working memory was intact in autism. Unusual rapid visual presentation may bother people with autism.
The oxytocin system of mice and men-Similarities and discrepancies of oxytocinergic modulation in rodents and primates.Nonapeptides and their respective receptors have been conserved throughout evolution and display astonishing similarities among the animal kingdom. They can be found in worms, birds, fish, amphibians, reptiles and mammals, including rodents, non-human primates and humans. In particular, the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) has attracted the attention of scientists due to its profound effects on social behavior. However, although both the neuropeptide and its receptor are identical in rodents and primates, the effects of OT vary greatly in the two species. Here, we provide a brief overview about OT's role in the evolution of mammals and provide reasons for the manifold effects of OT within the brain with a particular focus on the discrepancy of OT's effects in rodents and primates. In addition, we suggest new approaches towards improvement of translatability of scientific studies and highlight the most recent advances in animal models for autism spectrum disorder, a disease, in which the normal function of the OT system seems to be impaired.
Increased oxidative stress in the cerebellum and peripheral immune cells leads to exaggerated autism-like repetitive behavior due to deficiency of antioxidant response in BTBR T + tf/J mice.Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects social cognitive abilities resulting in communication or sensory deficits, and stereotyped behaviors in millions of people worldwide. Oxidant-antioxidant imbalance contributes significantly to the neurobehavioral dysregulations and severity of symptoms in patients with autism, however it has not been explored earlier whether it affects autism-like behavior directly. Therefore, we investigated oxidant-antioxidant balance in peripheral immune cells (neutrophils and CD3+ T cells) and cerebellum of BTBR T + tf/J (BTBR) mice which show autism-like behavior and the social C57BL/6 J (C57) mice. Further, we utilized buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a glutathione depleting agent to assess the impact of oxidant-antioxidant dysregulation on autism-like behavior. Our study shows that BTBR mice have increased lipid/protein oxidation products in cerebellum and neutrophils/CD3+ T cells along with increased NADPH oxidase (NOX2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression. This was concurrent with lower levels of glutathione and enzymatic antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in the cerebellum and peripheral immune cells. BSO administration led to further lowering of glutathione with a concurrent upregulation of iNOS, and NOX2 in cerebellum and peripheral immune cells. However, there was deficiency of an adaptive antioxidant response which was associated with exaggerated repetitive behaviors in BTBR mice. On the other hand, C57 mice also had increased oxidative stress after BSO treatment, however there was an enzymatic antioxidant response both in cerebellum and periphery. Overall, this study suggests that BTBR mice have increased oxidative stress with a deficient enzymatic antioxidant response that is associated with autism-like repetitive behaviors.
GABAρ3 expression in lobule X of the cerebellum is reduced in the valproate model of autism.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of developmental disorders characterized by social interaction deficits, communication impairments, and stereotyped and repetitive behaviors. Additionally, impairments in the GABAergic circuitry have been associated with ASD. Several studies have shown that dysfunction of the cerebellum is a hallmark of ASD, and postmortem studies in humans reported a reduced density of Purkinje cells (PCs) together with an abnormal expression of GABA
Internalizing Symptoms Mediate the Relation Between Acute Pain and Autism in Adults.Research on pain in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is in its infancy, with almost nothing known about how individual differences may predicting pain response in ASD. In the present study, 45 adults (28 male, age 22-48 years) with diagnoses of autism and intellectual delay were observed during vaccination or dental cleaning and their pain behaviours coded and measures of autism symptom severity, anxiety, depression and obsessivity taken. Our findings showed that greater autism severity predicted greater pain response which was partially mediated by anxiety and depression. These data suggest that mental health symptoms are important when considering pain response in autism. Mood must therefore be considered in future research on pain in ASD as well as clinical pain management.
Parental Perception and Participation in Genetic Testing Among Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders.The purpose of this study was to determine the factors associated with genetic testing in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and understand parental involvement in the decision to test using survey data of parents of children with ASD. Evaluation by a geneticist was associated with genetic testing by more than 39 times compared to evaluation by a nongeneticist (95% CI = 9.15-168.81). Those offered testing by the physicians were more than 6 times more likely to be tested than those not offered testing (95% CI = 1.66-24.61). Financial concerns, not being offered testing, and lack of awareness were the most consistent reasons for not testing given by participants. A physician's recommendation for testing and an evaluation by a geneticist were the most important factors associated with genetic testing in children with ASD. Educating primary care physicians and nongenetic specialists can potentially improve genetic testing among children with ASD.
Signing with the Face: Emotional Expression in Narrative Production in Deaf Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.This study examined facial expressions produced during a British Sign Language (BSL) narrative task (Herman et al., International Journal of Language and Communication Disorders 49(3):343-353, 2014) by typically developing deaf children and deaf children with autism spectrum disorder. The children produced BSL versions of a video story in which two children are seen to enact a language-free scenario where one tricks the other. This task encourages elicitation of facial acts signalling intention and emotion, since the protagonists showed a range of such expressions during the events portrayed. Results showed that typically developing deaf children produced facial expressions which closely aligned with native adult signers' BSL narrative versions of the task. Children with ASD produced fewer targeted expressions and showed qualitative differences in the facial actions that they produced.
Dependency of prepulse inhibition deficits on baseline startle reactivity in a mouse model of the human 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome.Hemizygous microdeletion at the chromosomal locus 22q11.2 is a copy number variation with strong genetic linkage to schizophrenia and related disorders. This association, along with its phenotypic overlap with the 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome, has motivated the establishment of Df[h22q11]/+ mice, in which the human 22q11.2 orthologous region is deleted. Previous investigations using this model showed the presence of reduced prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle reflex, a form of sensorimotor gating known to be impaired in a number of psychiatric disorders. Concomitantly to reduced PPI, however, Df[h22q11]/+ mice are also characterized by a robust increase in baseline startle reactivity, which may complicate or confound the interpretation of PPI. Therefore, the present study re-examined the relationship between acoustic startle reactivity and PPI in this mouse model. We found that while PPI is reduced in Df[h22q11]/+ mice when using its relative indexation (ie, % PPI), this deficit is no longer apparent when using the absolute quantification, that is, the direct comparison between pulse-alone and prepulse-plus-pulse conditions with successively increasing prepulse intensities. We further identified marked negative correlations between % PPI and startle reactivity in Df[h22q11]/+ mice. Moreover, when stratifying Df[h22q11]/+ mice into subgroups displaying low- and high-startle reactivity, only the latter subgroup displayed a significant reduction in % PPI. Collectively, our data suggest that alterations in baseline startle reactivity can confound the outcomes and interpretation of PPI in this mouse model of the human 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome.
A review of the use of EEG connectivity to measure the neurological characteristics of the sensory features in young people with autism.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition affecting about 1 in 100 children and is currently incurable. ASD represents a challenge to traditional methods of assessment and diagnosis, and it has been suggested that direct measures of brain activity and connectivity between brain regions during demanding tasks represents a potential pathway to building more accurate models of underlying brain function and ASD. One of the key behavioural diagnostic indicators of ASD consists of sensory features (SF), often characterised by over- or under-reactivity to environmental stimuli. SF are associated with behavioural difficulties that impede social and education success in these children as well as anxiety and depression. This review examines the previous literature on the measurement of EEG connectivity and SF observed in individuals with ASD.
Accuracy of Reported Community Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder.To compare community diagnoses of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) reported by parents to consensus diagnoses made using standardized tools plus clinical observation. 87 participants (85% male, average age 7.4 years), with reported community diagnosis of ASD were evaluated using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule) (ADOS-2), Differential Ability Scale (DAS-II), and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS-II). Detailed developmental and medical history was obtained from all participants. Diagnosis was based on clinical consensus of at least two expert clinicians, using test results, clinical observations, and parent report. 23% of participants with a reported community diagnosis of ASD were classified as non-spectrum based on our consensus diagnosis. ASD and non-spectrum participants did not differ on age at evaluation and age of first community diagnosis. Non-verbal IQ scores and Adaptive Behavior Composite scores were significantly higher in the non-spectrum group compared to the ASD group (104.5 ± 21.7 vs. 80.1 ± 21.6,
Prevalence of Unrecognized Autism Spectrum Disorders in Epilepsy: A Clinic-Based Study.To assess prevalence of unrecognized autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) in children with epilepsy using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV (DSM-IV) criteria and to evaluate factors affecting it in this population. It was a cross-sectional study conducted at a teaching hospital. It included randomly selected 106 children in the age 4-12 years with epilepsy, and without any structural anomaly identifiable on computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging. Children already diagnosed with ASD were excluded.
The Use of Differential Reinforcement of Other Behaviours to Establish Inhibitory Stimulus Control for the Management of Vocal Stereotypy in Children with Autism.This study examined the efficacy of an inhibitory stimulus control procedure (ISCP) for the management of vocal stereotypy in three children with autism.
"We Had to Keep Pushing": Caregivers' Perspectives on Autism Screening and Referral Practices of Black Children in Primary Care.Black children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are diagnosed later than their White peers, are more likely to be misdiagnosed, and are less likely to receive early intervention services or a developmental evaluation by three years old. Using a grounded theory approach, we solicited the perspectives of parents and other primary caregivers of Black children with ASD on barriers and facilitators to ASD screening and referrals in primary care. A socioeconomically diverse sample of 22 female caregivers participated. Four themes emerged. First, while some caregivers noted their child's primary healthcare providers facilitated a timely ASD diagnosis, other participants reported these providers ignored early concerns about child developmental delays. Second, many participants felt racial bias negatively impacted caregiver-primary healthcare provider interactions. Third, legal/custodial issues slowed caregivers' abilities to follow up on referrals from their primary healthcare providers. Finally, caregivers described denial, shame, and stigma relating to ASD in the Black community as possible factors for delayed follow up to referrals. Differences based on socioeconomic status are discussed. Efforts to improve family-centered, culturally relevant care for all Black caregivers raising children with or at-risk for ASD are needed, particularly for those families experiencing the multiple effects of poverty.
Autism-linked CHD gene expression patterns during development predict multi-organ disease phenotypes.Recent large-scale exome sequencing studies have identified mutations in several members of the CHD (Chromodomain Helicase DNA-binding protein) gene family in neurodevelopmental disorders. Mutations in the CHD2 gene have been linked to developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism and seizures, CHD8 mutations to autism and intellectual disability, whereas haploinsufficiency of CHD7 is associated with executive dysfunction and intellectual disability. In addition to these neurodevelopmental features, a wide range of other developmental defects are associated with mutants of these genes, especially with regards to CHD7 haploinsufficiency, which is the primary cause of CHARGE syndrome. Whilst the developmental expression of CHD7 has been reported previously, limited information on the expression of CHD2 and CHD8 during development is available. Here, we compare the expression patterns of all three genes during mouse development directly. We find high, widespread expression of these genes at early stages of development that gradually becomes restricted during later developmental stages. Chd2 and Chd8 are widely expressed in the developing central nervous system (CNS) at all stages of development, with moderate expression remaining in the neocortex, hippocampus, olfactory bulb and cerebellum of the postnatal brain. Similarly, Chd7 expression is seen throughout the CNS during late embryogenesis and early postnatal development, with strong enrichment in the cerebellum, but displays low expression in the cortex and neurogenic niches in early life. In addition to expression in the brain, novel sites of Chd2 and Chd8 expression are reported. These findings suggest additional roles for these genes in organogenesis and predict that mutation of these genes may predispose individuals to a range of other, non-neurological developmental defects.
'It's different for girls': Gender differences in the friendships and conflict of autistic and neurotypical adolescents.This mixed-methods study examined gender differences in the friendships and conflict experiences of autistic girls and boys relative to their neurotypical peers. In total, 102 adolescents (27 autistic girls, 26 autistic boys, 26 neurotypical girls, and 23 neurotypical boys), aged between 11 and 18 years completed the Friendship Qualities Scale, the Revised Peer Experiences Questionnaire and were interviewed about their friendships. Results demonstrated that in many ways, the friendships and social experiences of autistic girls are similar to those of neurotypical girls. Autistic girls, however, have significantly more social challenges than their neurotypical peers, experiencing more conflict and finding that conflict harder to manage successfully. Autistic boys showed quantitatively different friendship patterns to all other groups. There were consistent gender differences in the type of conflict which boys and girls experienced, regardless of diagnostic status. These findings suggest that gender, rather than diagnosis per se, plays a critical role in the way that autistic adolescents perceive and experience their social relationships.
Homozygous 2p11.2 deletion supports the implication of ELMOD3 in hearing loss and reveals the potential association of CAPG with ASD/ID etiology.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a set of neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by early-onset difficulties in social communication and unusually restricted, repetitive behavior and interests. Parental consanguinity may lead to higher risk of ASD and to more severe clinical presentations in the offspring. Studies of ASD families with high inbreeding enable the identification of inherited variants of this disorder particularly those with an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. In our study, using copy number variants (CNV) analysis, we identified a rare homozygous deletion in 2p11.2 region that affects ELMOD3, CAPG, and SH2D6 genes in a boy with ASD, intellectual disability (ID), and hearing impairment (HI). This deletion may reveal a new contiguous deletion syndrome in which ELMOD3, known to be implicated in autosomal recessive deafness underlies the HI of the proband and CAPG, member of actin regulatory proteins involved in cytoskeletal dynamic, an important function for brain development and activity, underlies the ASD/ID phenotype. A possible contribution of SH2D6 gene, as a part of a chimeric gene, to the clinical presentation of the patient is discussed. Our result supports the implication of ELMOD3 in hearing loss and highlights the potential clinical relevance of 2p11.2 deletion in autism and/or intellectual disability.
Autistic Traits in the Neurotypical Population do not Predict Increased Response Conservativeness in Perceptual Decision Making.Recent research has shown that adults and children with autism spectrum disorders have a more conservative decision criterion in perceptual decision making compared to neurotypical individuals, meaning that autistic participants prioritise accuracy over speed of a decision. Here, we test whether autistic traits in the neurotypical population correlate with increased response conservativeness. We employed three different tasks; for two tasks we recruited participants from China ( N = 39) and for one task from the United Kingdom ( N = 37). Our results show that autistic traits in the neurotypical population do not predict variation in response criterion. We also failed to replicate previous work showing a relationship between autistic traits and sensitivity to coherent motion and static orientation. Following the argument proposed by Gregory and Plaisted-Grant, we discuss why perceptual differences between autistic and neurotypical participants do not necessarily predict perceptual differences between neurotypical participants with high and low autistic traits.
Oxytocin and excitation/inhibition balance in social recognition.Social recognition is the sensitive domains of complex behavior critical for identification, interpretation and storage of socially meaningful information. Social recognition develops throughout childhood and adolescent, and is affected in a wide variety of psychiatric disorders. Recently, new data appeared on the molecular mechanisms of these processes, particularly, the excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) ratio which is modified during development, and then E/I balance is established in the adult brain. While E/I imbalance has been proposed as a mechanism for schizophrenia, it also seems to be the common mechanism in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In addition, there is a strong suggestion that the oxytocinergic system is related to GABA-mediated E/I control in the context of brain socialization. In this review, we attempt to summarize the underpinning molecular mechanisms of E/I balance and its imbalance, and related biomarkers in the brain in healthiness and pathology. In addition, because there are increasing interest on oxytocin in the social neuroscience field, we will pay intensive attention to the role of oxytocin in maintaining E/I balance from the viewpoint of its effects on improving social impairment in psychiatric diseases, especially in ASD.
Audiovisual multisensory integration in individuals with autism spectrum disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis.An ever-growing literature has aimed to determine how individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) differ from their typically developing (TD) peers on measures of multisensory integration (MSI) and to ascertain the degree to which differences in MSI are associated with the broad range of symptoms associated with ASD. Findings, however, have been highly variable across the studies carried out to date. The present work systematically reviews and quantitatively synthesizes the large literature on audiovisual MSI in individuals with ASD to evaluate the cumulative evidence for (a) group differences between individuals with ASD and TD peers, (b) correlations between MSI and autism symptoms in individuals with ASD and (c) study level factors that may moderate findings (i.e., explain differential effects) observed across studies. To identify eligible studies, a comprehensive search strategy was employed using the ProQuest search engine, PubMed database, forwards and backwards citation searches, direct author contact, and hand-searching of select conference proceedings. A significant between-group difference in MSI was evident in the literature, with individuals with ASD demonstrating worse audiovisual integration on average across studies compared to TD controls. This effect was moderated by mean participant age, such that between-group differences were more pronounced in younger samples. The mean correlation between MSI and autism and related symptomatology was also significant, indicating that increased audiovisual integration in individuals with ASD is associated with better language/communication abilities and/or reduced autism symptom severity in the extant literature. This effect was moderated by whether the stimuli were linguistic versus non-linguistic in nature, such that correlation magnitudes tended to be significantly greater when linguistic stimuli were utilized in the measure of MSI. Limitations and future directions for primary and meta-analytic research are discussed.
Do Beliefs About Whether Others Can See Modulate Social Seeking in Autism?Autistic people process gaze differently than typical people, but it is not yet clear if these differences lie in the processing of eye-shapes or the belief in whether others can see (perceptual mentalizing). We aimed to investigate whether these two models of gaze processing modulate social seeking in typical and autistic adults. We measured preferences of participants to view videos of an actress with visible or hidden eyes, who can or cannot see out. While typical participants preferred videos where the actress can see through and has visible eyes, autistic people showed no preference for these videos. These findings are discussed in the context of perceptual mentalizing and the social motivation theory of autism.
Salivary Factors Related to Caries in Children with Autism.Many predisposing factors to caries are present in autism, however, it is unlikely that autistic patients exhibit higher caries indexes than the rest of the population.
Apgar score and risk of autism.Low Apgar score has been associated with higher risk for several neurological and psychiatric disorders, including cerebral palsy and intellectual disability. Studies of the association between Apgar score and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been inconsistent. We aimed to investigate (1) the association between low Apgar score at 5 min and risk for ASD, and (2) the modifying effects of gestational age and sex on this association in the largest multinational database of ASD. We included prospective data from 5.5 million individuals and over 33,000 cases of ASD from Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Western Australia who were born between 1984 and 2007. We calculated crude and adjusted risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the associations between low Apgar score and ASD. All analyses for ASD were repeated for autistic disorder (AD). We used interaction terms and stratified analysis to investigate the effects of sex, gestational age, and birth weight on the association. In fully adjusted models, low Apgar scores (1-3) (RR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.16-1.74), and intermediate Apgar scores (4-6) (RR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.36-1.65) were associated with a higher RR of ASD than optimal Apgar score (7-10). The point estimates for low (RR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.41-2.51) and intermediate Apgar score (RR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.32-1.81) were larger for AD than for ASD. This study suggests that low Apgar score is associated with higher risk of ASD, and in particular AD. We did not observe any major modifying effects of gestational age and sex, although there seems to be substantial confounding by gestational age and birth weight on the observed association.
Estimating contribution of rare non-coding variants to neuropsychiatric disorders.Owing to recent advances in DNA sequencing technology, a number of large-scale comprehensive analyses of genetic variations in protein-coding regions (i.e., whole-exome sequencing studies), have been conducted for neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders, intellectual disability, and schizophrenia. These studies, especially those focusing on de novo (newly arising) mutations and extremely rare variants, have successfully identified previously unrecognized disease genes/mutations with a large effect size and deepen our understanding of the biology of neuropsychiatric diseases. Along with the continuously dropping sequencing cost, now the target of sequencing studies is expanding from the exome to the whole human genome. Several pioneering works have provided important insights into the contribution of rare non-coding variants to neuropsychiatric diseases. At the same time, these studies highlight need for further larger sample sizes and improvement in annotation of non-coding regulatory variants. In this review, key findings from recent studies as well as likely future directions are overviewed.
Development, behaviour and autism in individuals with SMC1A variants.Development and behaviour in Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS), including autism characteristics, have been described infrequently stratified to genetic cause and only a few studies have considered behavioural characteristics in relation to developmental level. Here, we describe the behavioural phenotype in individuals with CdLS with SMC1A variants.
Outcomes of children receiving Group-Early Start Denver Model in an inclusive versus autism-specific setting: A pilot randomized controlled trial.A major topic of debate is whether children with autism spectrum disorder should be educated in inclusive or specialized settings. We examined the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of delivering the Group-Early Start Denver Model to children with autism spectrum disorder in inclusive versus specialized classrooms. We randomly assigned 44 preschoolers with autism spectrum disorder to receive the Group-Early Start Denver Model across one school calendar year in classrooms that included only children with autism spectrum disorder or mostly children who were typically developing. Blind-rated indicators of teaching quality showed similar results across settings, which were above the local benchmark. Children showed improvements across blinded proximal measures of spontaneous vocalization, social interaction, and imitation and across distal measures of verbal cognition, adaptive behavior, and autism symptoms irrespective of intervention setting. Mothers of participants experienced a reduction in stress irrespective of child intervention setting. Across both settings, age at intervention start was negatively associated with gains in verbal cognition. Delivery of Group-Early Start Denver Model in an inclusive setting appeared to be feasible, with no significant differences in teaching quality and child improvements when the program was implemented in inclusive versus specialized classrooms.
The roles of neighborhood composition and autism prevalence on vaccination exemption pockets: A population-wide study.The number of children entering schools without mandated vaccinations has increased in high-income countries due to the rise of nonmedical exemptions from school vaccination requirements. Herd immunity is threatened when unvaccinated children are concentrated in spatial pockets. Despite the role of vaccine-autism controversy in the current wave of the anti-vaccine movement, we do not know if exemption clusters are associated with local autism rates; it is often assumed that these clusters are merely the result of sociodemographic composition. This study uses data on the number of students with a Personal Belief Exemption reported by schools from 1992 to 2014 and unique data on the locations of children with an autism diagnosis in California to study the correlates of large exemption pockets. Our spatial analysis shows that the prevalence of autism is not associated with the locations of large pockets of vaccination exemptions. Likewise, the spatial distributions of socioeconomic factors and proximity to health care resources have limited roles in explaining these large exemption pockets. Racial/ethnic composition, however, has strong associations with the locations of the large pockets. Our results suggest that community-level interventions are needed to maintain herd immunity as exemption pockets are not merely the result of population composition.
The way others move can influence what we choose.Whether pointing at a menu item or rifling through a clothes rack, when we choose we often move. We investigated whether people's tendency to copy the movements of others could influence their choices. Participants saw pairs of pictures in private and indicated which one they preferred. They then entered a virtual art gallery and saw the same picture pairs in the presence of a virtual character. Having observed the virtual character point to indicate her preference with either a high or low movement trajectory, participants indicated their preference. There was either an anatomical (same movement, same choice) or spatial correspondence (same movement, different choice) between the participant's pictures and those of the virtual character. We found that participants copied the movement made by the virtual character rather than her action goal (i.e., her choice of picture). This resulted in a shift towards the virtual character's preferences in the anatomical condition but away from her preferences in the spatial condition. This effect was driven by the observation of the virtual character's high pointing movements. In a further experiment, we did not find any significant differences in imitation behaviour in autism, although autistic participants were less consistent in their choices. Our findings demonstrate that we are not only influenced by other's choices but also the types of movements others make to indicate those choices.
Viewpoints on how students with autism can best navigate university.Despite recognition of the challenges faced by students with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) there is limited understanding of the barriers and facilitators to participation in major life areas, such as being a university student.
Blunted serum 25(OH)D response to vitamin DData suggest a potential role for vitamin D in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) prevention and treatment. It is likely that the serum response to vitamin D supplementation contributes to its effectiveness. Multiple factors affect serum vitamin D 25(OH)D response to supplementation.
Disruption of MET Receptor Tyrosine Kinase, an Autism Risk Factor, Impairs Developmental Synaptic Plasticity in the Hippocampus.As more genes conferring risks to neurodevelopmental disorders are identified, translating these genetic risk factors into biological mechanisms that impact the trajectory of the developing brain is a critical next step. Here, we report that disrupted signaling mediated MET receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), an established risk factor for autism spectrum disorders, in the developing hippocampus glutamatergic circuit leads to profound deficits in neural development, synaptic transmission, and plasticity. In cultured hippocampus slices prepared from neonatal mice, pharmacological inhibition of MET kinase activity suppresses dendritic arborization and disrupts normal dendritic spine development. In addition, single-neuron knockdown (RNAi) or overexpression of Met in the developing hippocampal CA1 neurons leads to alterations, opposite in nature, in basal synaptic transmission and long-term plasticity. In forebrain-specific Met conditional knockout mice (Met
Sensitive Periods for Cerebellar-Mediated Autistic-like Behaviors.Despite a prevalence exceeding 1%, mechanisms underlying autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are poorly understood, and targeted therapies and guiding parameters are urgently needed. We recently demonstrated that cerebellar dysfunction is sufficient to generate autistic-like behaviors in a mouse model of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Here, using the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)-specific inhibitor rapamycin, we define distinct sensitive periods for treatment of autistic-like behaviors with sensitive periods extending into adulthood for social behaviors. We identify cellular and electrophysiological parameters that may contribute to behavioral rescue, with rescue of Purkinje cell survival and excitability corresponding to social behavioral rescue. In addition, using anatomic and diffusion-based MRI, we identify structural changes in cerebellar domains implicated in ASD that correlate with sensitive periods of specific autism-like behaviors. These findings thus not only define treatment parameters into adulthood, but also support a mechanistic basis for the targeted rescue of autism-related behaviors.
Stapedial reflex threshold predicts individual loudness tolerance for people with autistic spectrum disorders.People with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) frequently show the symptoms of oversensitivity to sound (hyperacusis). Although the previous studies have investigated methods for quantifying hyperacusis in ASD, appropriate physiological signs for quantifying hyperacusis in ASD remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the relationship of loudness tolerance with the threshold of the stapedial reflex and with contralateral suppression of the distortion product otoacoustic emissions, which has been suggested to be related to hyperacusis in people without ASD. We tested an ASD group and a neurotypical group. The results revealed that only the stapedial reflex threshold was significantly correlated with loudness tolerance in both groups. In addition to reduced loudness tolerance, people with lower stapedial reflex thresholds also exhibited higher scores on the Social Responsiveness Scale-2.
Extreme male developmental trajectories of homotopic brain connectivity in autism.It has been proposed that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may be characterized by an extreme male brain (EMB) pattern of brain development. Here, we performed the first investigation of how age-related changes in functional brain connectivity may be expressed differently in females and males with ASD. We analyzed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 107 typically developing (TD) females, 114 TD males, 104 females, and 115 males with ASD (6-26 years) from the autism brain imaging data exchange repository. We explored how interhemispheric homotopic connectivity and its maturational curvatures change across groups. Differences between ASD and TD and between females and males with ASD were observed for the rate of changes in connectivity in the absence of overall differences in connectivity. The largest portion of variance in age-related changes in connectivity was described through similarities between TD males, ASD males, and ASD females, in contrast to TD females. We found that shape of developmental curvature is associated with symptomatology in both males and females with ASD. We demonstrated that females and males with ASD tended to follow the male pattern of developmental changes in interhemispheric connectivity, supporting the EMB theory of ASD.
Genetic mutations in CaDendritic morphology is a critical determinant of neuronal connectivity, and calcium signaling plays a predominant role in shaping dendrites. Altered dendritic morphology and genetic mutations in calcium signaling are both associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). In this study we tested the hypothesis that dendritic arborization and NDD-relevant behavioral phenotypes are altered by human mutations that modulate calcium-dependent signaling pathways implicated in NDDs. The dendritic morphology of pyramidal neurons in CA1 hippocampus and somatosensory cortex was quantified in Golgi-stained brain sections from juvenile mice of both sexes expressing either a human gain-of-function mutation in ryanodine receptor 1 (T4826I-RYR1), a human CGG repeat expansion (170-200 CGG repeats) in the fragile X mental retardation gene 1 (FMR1 premutation), both mutations (double mutation; DM), or wildtype mice. In hippocampal neurons, increased dendritic arborization was observed in male T4826I-RYR1 and, to a lesser extent, male FMR1 premutation neurons. Dendritic morphology of cortical neurons was altered in both sexes of FMR1 premutation and DM animals with the most pronounced differences seen in DM females. Genotype also impaired behavior, as assessed using the three-chambered social approach test. The most striking lack of sociability was observed in DM male and female mice. In conclusion, mutations that alter the fidelity of calcium signaling enhance dendritic arborization in a brain region- and sex-specific manner and impair social behavior in juvenile mice. The phenotypic outcomes of these mutations likely provide a susceptible biological substrate for additional environmental stressors that converge on calcium signaling to determine individual NDD risk.
Heart rate variability of typically developing and autistic children and adults before, during and after sleep.Studies suggest a sympathetic-parasympathetic disequilibrium in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), compared to typically developing (TD) children. The autonomic nervous system (ANS) shows profound modification with age but studies in ASD adults are lacking. The ANS is also influenced by vigilance states such as wakefulness and sleep. The aim of this study is to explore differences in ANS activity in typically developing (TD) and ASD individuals during sleep and wakefulness, as a function of age.
Relationship of Weight Outcomes, Co-Occurring Conditions, and Severity of Autism Spectrum Disorder in the Study to Explore Early Development.To assess contributing factors to increased obesity risk, by comparing children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), developmental delays/disorders, and general population controls in weight status, and to examine associations between weight status and presence of co-occurring medical, behavioral, developmental, or psychiatric conditions across groups and ASD severity among children with ASD.
Feasibility of Automated Training for Facial Emotion Expression and Recognition in Autism.Impairment in facial emotion recognition (FER) and facial emotion expression (FEE), often documented in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), are believed to contribute to the observed core social-communication disability that characterizes this disorder. Moreover, impaired FER and FEE are frequently seen in other disorders and problem behaviors. We describe the development of a novel system to detect and give real-time feedback on these processes, termed facial emotion expression training (FEET), an automated, gamelike system that is based on 3-dimensional sensing (Kinect) technology. A sample of 40 children (n = 20 ASD, n = 20 typically developing) interacted with our prototype system, which presented audiovisual stimuli and assessed responses of participants. Overall, consumer satisfaction ratings were high, and youth with ASD reported enjoying interacting with the system more than did the typical youth. Results suggest that new technology-based interventions are acceptable to consumers and viable for use in remediation of transdiagnostic processes, such as FER and FEE. Implications for future technology-based intervention to target transdiagnostic processes are discussed.
Environmental enrichment has minimal effects on behavior in the Shank3 complete knockout model of autism spectrum disorder.Several studies have supported the use of enriched environments to prevent the manifestation of ASD-like phenotypes in laboratory rodents. While the translational value of such experiments is unknown, the findings have been relatively consistent across many different models.
EEG-based multi-feature fusion assessment for autism.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder which affects the developmental trajectory in several behavioral domains, including impairments of social communication, cognitive and language abilities. In this paper, multi-feature fusion method based on EEG signal is used to extract as many as possible features including power spectrum analysis, bicoherence, entropy and coherence methods, then we use minimum redundancy maximum correlation (mRMR) algorithm to choose the features, which are applied to input to three classifiers to obtain accuracy classification results. We try to find some key biomarkers of ASD by examining the accuracy of classifier, using different models which use the combination of multiplex features. The results show when nine features are selected by SVM-linear classifier, the accuracy is up to 91.38%. This method might provide objective basis for clinical diagnosis of autism.
Caregivers' perception of dignity in teenagers with autism spectrum disorder.Maintaining dignity is one of patients is one of the main ethical responsibilities of caregivers. However, in many cases, the dignity of patients, especially autistic teenagers is not maintained. The extent to which dignity needs are met for this group within the Iranian care system is difficult to determine as dignity is an abstract concept, and there are few related research studies reported.
Weighted Walking Influences Lower Extremity Coordination in Children on the Autism Spectrum.There is sparse quantitative research regarding gait coordination patterns of children on the autism spectrum, though previous studies, relying only upon observational data, have alluded to characteristically poor movement coordination. This study compared walking with a weighted vest, a backpack carriage, and an unloaded walking condition on lower extremity coordination among 10 male children (aged 8-17 years) on the autism spectrum. All participants completed 15 gait trials in the following three conditions: (a) unloaded, (b) wearing a backpack weighted with 15% body mass, and (c) wearing a vest weighted with 15% body mass. We used continuous relative phase analysis to quantify lower extremity coordination and analyzed data through both group and single-subject comparisons. We used the Model Statistic to test for statistical significance at each of the normalized data points for each segment couple (thigh-leg, leg-foot, and thigh-foot). The first 10 and last 10 stride blocks were tested for possible accommodation strategies. Group comparisons revealed no coordination changes among the three conditions (likely due to insufficient statistical power), while single-subject comparisons exposed significant decreased variability in gait coordination patterns ( p < .05) in both loaded conditions, relative to the unloaded condition. These participants exhibited variable coordination patterns during the unloaded gait. When walking with loads, coordination pattern variability of the lower extremities was decreased. This finding suggests that walking while carrying or wearing heavy objects may reduce the number of potential motor pattern choices and thus decrease the overall variability of lower extremity movement patterns. Additional research with a larger and more diverse participant sample is required to confirm this conclusion.
Effects of Equine Therapy on Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Systematic Review.Literature on effects of equine therapy in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has grown in recent times. Equine therapy is an alternative multimodal intervention that involves utilizing a horse to enhance core impairments in ASD. Recent systematic reviews in this area have several limitations including inclusion of populations other than ASD, assessment of a variety of animal-assisted interventions other than equine therapy, and a failure to conduct quantitative analyses to provide accurate effect size estimates. We conducted a focused systematic review to address these limitations. Our review suggested that equine therapy has beneficial effects on behavioral skills and to some extent on social communication in ASD. The evidence for positive effects of equine therapy on perceptuo-motor, cognitive, and functional skills is currently limited.
Autism and Probable Prerequisites: Severe and Scheduled Prenatal Stresses at Spotlight.Due to the importance of prenatal maternal stress as environmental factor on autism, the influence of prenatal maternal psychological agitations was assessed in relation with the risk of autism.
The Role of Vitamin D in Fertility and during Pregnancy and Lactation: A Review of Clinical Data.Vitamin D deficiency is common and there exists a huge gap between recommended dietary vitamin D intakes and the poor vitamin D supply in the general population. While vitamin D is important for musculoskeletal health, there are accumulating data suggesting that vitamin D may also be important for fertility, pregnancy outcomes and lactation. Significant changes in vitamin D metabolism during pregnancy such as increased production of the "active vitamin D hormone" calcitriol support the important role of vitamin D in this setting. Observational studies show that vitamin D deficiency is a risk marker for reduced fertility and various adverse pregnancy outcomes and is associated with a low vitamin D content of breast milk. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) document that physiological vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy is safe and improves vitamin D and calcium status, thereby protecting skeletal health. Although certain RCTs and/or meta-analyses reported some other beneficial effects, it is still not clear whether vitamin D supplementation improves fertility or decreases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as low birth weight, pre-eclampsia and neonatal mortality, or reduces wheeze/asthma in the infants. Nevertheless, vitamin D supplementation in pregnant women is frequently required to achieve a sufficient vitamin D status as recommended by nutritional vitamin D guidelines. In this review, we provide an overview of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and large trials reporting clinical data on the role of vitamin D for fertility, pregnancy and lactation.
Clinical and neuropsychological outcomes for children with phenylketonuria in Upper Egypt; a single-center study over 5 years.Phenylketonuria (PKU) is considered to be a rare inborn error of metabolism but one of the commonest causes of mental retardation if untreated.
Facilitation of biological motion processing by group-based autism specific social skills training.Abnormalities in neurophysiological correlates of social perception are a well-known feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, little is known if and how ASD specific behavioral interventions may affect neural processing in ASD. The aim of the current study was to investigate for the first time, whether the group-based social skills training SOSTA-FRA would elicit changes in neurophysiological correlates of social perception in high-functioning ASD individuals aged 8-17 years. Event-related potentials (ERPs) of a facial emotion recognition (FER) and a biological motion perception task were examined. ERPs were compared between a randomized intervention and a treatment as usual group at three time points (baseline, post-intervention, and at 3 months follow-up). A reduction of P100 amplitude in the right hemisphere and a trend toward reduced N200 latency in the biological motion task were found after the training only in the intervention group, whereas behavioral performance remained stable. Change in N200 latencies and parent-rated social responsiveness showed small but statistically nonsignificant correlations. No changes were observed regarding FER. Results indicate that the intervention changed neural correlates of social perception in ASD. Especially neural correlates of biological motion perception, which is an important prerequisite for successful social interaction, were sensitive to change. ERPs of social perception tasks that are impaired in ASD can well be used to objectively measure neural processing improvement by behavioral intervention. Autism Res 2018, 11: 1376-1387. © 2018 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: It is well known that people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) process social information differently than other people and that these differences can also be seen in their brain activity. We also know that behavioral therapies, such as group-based social skills trainings can help people with ASD improve their behavior. But it is unclear how therapy changes social processing in the brain. The aim of our study was therefore to examine how neural processing of social stimuli changed after behavioral intervention. Comparing a group of children and adolescents that received the group-based social skills training SOSTA-FRA to a control group we found that the neural processing of human motion became faster and involved less brain resources after the intervention, while behavioral performance remained stable. No changes were seen for the processing of emotional facial expressions. We recommend that future studies should also analyze changes in brain function as well as behavioral changes as a secondary therapy outcome parameter.

Cathepsin B inhibition ameliorates leukocyte-endothelial adhesion in the BTBR mouse model of autism.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a wide range of neurodevelopmental disorders involving deficits in social interaction and communication. Unfortunately, autism remains a scientific and clinical challenge owing to the lack of understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying it. This study aimed to investigate the pathophysiological mechanism underlying leukocyte-endothelial adhesion in autism-related neurovascular inflammation.
Neurodevelopmental Disorders Affecting Sociability: Recent Research Advances and Future Directions in Autism Spectrum Disorder and Williams Syndrome.In this review, we summarize current knowledge and hypotheses on the nature of social abnormalities in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Williams syndrome (WS).
Spanish Cultural Validation of the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised.The Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers-revised/follow-up (M-CHAT-R/F) was developed to reduce the number of cases requiring telephone verification. The aim of this study was to validate a Spanish version of the M-CHAT-R/F in the Spanish public health system. The M-CHAT-R/F was translated, culturally adapted, and then administered to 6625 children. Of the 39 positive screening cases, 15 children were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 24 with non-ASD disorders or delays. The sensitivity was 0.79 and specificity of 0.99. Positive and negative predictive values were 0.39 and 0.99, respectively. These results are similar to the English equivalent, though observed prevalence was lower. This study supports Spanish National Health System policy makers to consider a universal ASD screening program.
Prevalence of sensory impairments, physical and intellectual disabilities, and mental health in children and young people with self/proxy-reported autism: Observational study of a whole country population.This study investigated the comorbid conditions in a whole country population of children/young people aged 0-24 years with and without autism. Data were drawn from Scotland's Census 2011. We calculated the percentage with autism, their extent of comorbid conditions, odds ratio (with 95% confidence intervals) of autism predicting comorbidities, adjusted for age and gender, and odds ratio for age and gender predicting comorbidities within the cohort with autism. A total of 25,063/1,548,819 (1.6%) had autism: 19,880 (79.3%) males and 5183 (20.7%) females. Autism had an odds ratio of 5.4 (5.1-5.6) for predicting deafness/partial hearing loss, odds ratio of 8.9 (8.1-9.7) for blindness/partial sight loss, odds ratio of 49.7 (38.1-64.9) for intellectual disabilities, odds ratio of 15.7 (13.4-18.5) for mental health conditions, odds ratio of 15.8 (14.1-17.8) for physical disability and odds ratio of 3.9 (3.8-4.0) for other conditions. Females with autism were more likely to have each additional condition than males, including intellectual disabilities, suggesting they may have more severe autism than males and adding evidence that autism may be currently underdiagnosed in more intellectually able females. These conditions are disabling and have a significant impact on long-term quality of life; their coexistence with autism adds extra complexity. It is important to raise clinicians' awareness of this extent of comorbidity, and to have accurate prevalence data to plan prevention and intervention measures, and to follow health inequality trends.
Effects of Exergaming on Physical and Cognitive Functions in Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Systematic Review.The increase in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) population triggers a deep concern within public health. This alarming trend stresses the need for the development of effective strategies that might aid with this growing population. Exergaming has several advantages as an ASD intervention, such as flexible play, a private space for exercise, and diverse types of physical activity. The study aims to analyze the effectiveness of exergaming interventions on individuals with ASD. The systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Studies which employed exergaming interventions on individuals with ASD were considered for inclusion. Exergaming-related changes in participants' physical and cognitive functions were the main interest of the current review. Ten articles satisfied the predetermined eligibility criteria. Thematic coding categorized the main outcomes into two higher-order themes and five subthemes. The higher-order themes were physical performance and cognitive performance. The emerged subthemes were physical fitness, motor performance, intensity of physical activity, executive function, and self-perception. Following exergame interventions, individuals with ASD indicated significant improvements in physical fitness, executive function, and self-perception. Exergaming also increased participation in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. In contrast, exergaming indicated small impact on emotional regulation and did not provide adequate opportunities for motor skill development. It is worth noting that only one randomized controlled trial was included in the current review. Future research would require more rigorous study designs to provide reliable evidence on the effectiveness of exergaming interventions for individuals with ASD. Exergaming interventions lead to improved physical and cognitive functions in individuals with ASD. It is suggested that exergaming be used as a feasible supplement to traditional physical activity programs for individuals with ASD.
 Mutant Mice Display Hyperactivity Insensitive to Methylphenidate and Reduced Flexibility in Social Motivation, but Normal Social Recognition.Mouse models of autism can be used to study evolutionarily conserved mechanisms underlying behavioral abnormalities in social communication and repetitive behaviors.
Evidence for Brainstem Contributions to Autism Spectrum Disorders.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects one in 59 children in the United States. Although there is a mounting body of knowledge of cortical and cerebellar contributions to ASD, our knowledge about the early developing brainstem in ASD is only beginning to accumulate. Understanding how brainstem neurotransmission is implicated in ASD is important because many of this condition's sensory and motor symptoms are consistent with brainstem pathology. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to integrate epidemiological, behavioral, histological, neuroimaging, and animal evidence of brainstem contributions to ASD. Because ASD is a neurodevelopmental condition, we examined the available data through a lens of hierarchical brain development. The review of the literature suggests that developmental alterations of the brainstem could have potential cascading effects on cortical and cerebellar formation, ultimately leading to ASD symptoms. This view is supported by human epidemiology findings and data from animal models of ASD, showing that perturbed development of the brainstem substructures, particularly during the peak formation of the brainstem's monoaminergic centers, may relate to ASD or ASD-like behaviors. Furthermore, we review evidence from human histology, psychophysiology, and neuroimaging suggesting that brainstem development and maturation may be atypical in ASD and may be related to key ASD symptoms, such as atypical sensorimotor features and social responsiveness. From this review there emerges the need of future research to validate early detection of the brainstem-based somatosensory and psychophysiological behaviors that emerge in infancy, and to examine the brainstem across the life span, while accounting for age. In all, there is preliminary evidence for brainstem involvement in ASD, but a better understanding of the brainstem's role would likely pave the way for earlier diagnosis and treatment of ASD.
A cross sectional study to evaluate the oral health status of children with intellectual disabilities in the National Capital Region of India (Delhi-NCR).Children with intellectual disabilities (ID) have usually been reported to have poorer levels of oral hygiene and higher prevalence of dental caries than their compeers. The present study was conducted to assess the status of dental caries and oral hygiene in different categories of institutionalised children with ID (syndromic and non-syndromic) registered in various special schools of Delhi (National Capital Region, India).
Associations between polygenic risk scores for four psychiatric illnesses and brain structure using multivariate pattern recognition.Psychiatric illnesses are complex and polygenic. They are associated with widespread alterations in the brain, which are partly influenced by genetic factors. There have been some attempts to relate polygenic risk scores (PRS) - a measure of the overall genetic risk an individual carries for a disorder - to brain structure using univariate methods. However, PRS are likely associated with distributed and covarying effects across the brain. We therefore used multivariate machine learning in this proof-of-principle study to investigate associations between brain structure and PRS for four psychiatric disorders; attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. The sample included 213 individuals comprising patients with depression (69), bipolar disorder (33), and healthy controls (111). The five psychiatric PRSs were calculated based on summary data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. T1-weighted magnetic resonance images were obtained and voxel-based morphometry was implemented in SPM12. Multivariate relevance vector regression was implemented in the Pattern Recognition for Neuroimaging Toolbox (PRoNTo). Across the whole sample, a multivariate pattern of grey matter significantly predicted the PRS for autism (r = 0.20, p
School-related anxiety symptomatology in a community sample of primary-school-aged children on the autism spectrum.Although it is recognized that the prevalence of anxiety is elevated in children with autism spectrum disorder, there has been very limited research exploring such anxiety in school contexts. As a result, there is limited detailed information for teachers or educators on how anxiety in autism may present in the school setting for children on the autism spectrum. The aims of this study were to (a) report the profile of results on a measure of school anxiety in a community sample of children on the autism spectrum, (b) investigate whether scores on this measure differed with child variables or enrollment into a mainstream or special school, and (c) document the level of agreement between teacher-reported and parent-reported anxiety symptoms. Teachers of 92 children aged 5-12 completed a questionnaire pack including the School Anxiety Scale-Teacher Rating (SAS-TR). Elevated levels of anxiety (above the SAS-TR total anxiety clinical cut-off) were noted in 21.7% of the sample, with a larger proportion of children scoring above the generalized anxiety cut-off (27.2%) than the social anxiety cut-off (14.1%). Older participants (U = 744, p = .02, η
Dosage effects of human ribosomal genes (rDNA) in health and disease.Human ribosomal RNA genes encoding a pre-transcript of the three major ribosomal RNA (18S, 5.8S, and 28S rRNA) are tandemly repeated in human genome. Their total copy number varies from 250 to 670 per diploid genome with a mean of approximately 420 copies, but only a fraction of them is transcriptionally active. The functional consequences of human ribosomal RNA gene dosage are not widely known and often assumed to be negligible. Here, we review the facts of rRNA gene dosage effects on normal growth and aging, stress resistance of healthy individuals, and survivability of patients with chromosomal abnormalities, as well as on the risk and severity of some multifactorial diseases with proven genetic predisposition. An original hypothesis that rRNA gene dosage can be a modulating factor involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and rheumatoid arthritis is put forward.
Feasibility of utilizing autism navigator® for primary care in South Africa.There is a significant research-to-practice gap in early detection of young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) worldwide but particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where expertise is limited and high-quality training is difficult to access. Autism Navigator® for Primary Care is a web-based course designed to increase awareness of red flags of ASD in the second year of life and thus promote earlier detection and referral for intervention. It contains extensive video illustrations that offer rapid access to multiple exemplars of ASD red flags. This study examined aspects of feasibility of the Autism Navigator® for Primary Care in one LMIC, South Africa. A mixed-methods quasi-experimental design was used to examine relevant professionals' implementation of the course and measure changes in their knowledge of red flags after training. Perceptions of the acceptability, demand, and practicality of the course were explored in focus groups. Sixty-two providers completed the course online with a 94% completion rate. Built-in learner assessment pass rates ranged from 88% to 100%. Second-language English speakers took longer to complete the learner assessments, and professionals with less access to the Internet spent less time in the course. Participants' perceptions of the acceptability, demand, and practicality of the course were mostly positive with some suggestions made for local conditions. Results supported the feasibility of the course in this LMIC with some supports required pertaining to language and Internet access. We propose that this training has the potential to lower the age of detection of ASD in South Africa and other LMICs. Autism Research 2018, 11: 1511-1521. © 2018 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: Professionals in low- and middle-income countries urgently need training to recognize red flags of autism in very young children. The feasibility of utilizing the Autism Navigator® for Primary Care course for this training was explored with 62 South African professionals. After training, professionals' knowledge of early red flags improved, and most reported the course important and needed in South Africa. They found the web-based design mostly acceptable, practical, and culturally applicable. The course could help lower the age of autism detection.
Fathers Raising Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: Stories of Marital Stability as Key to Parenting Success.Using media reports of high divorce rates among couples of children with ASD as a point of departure, our purpose in this paper is to examine how married fathers of children with ASD understand their marriages relative to the demands of ASD and in the context of media reports of elevated divorce rates among parents raising children with ASD. We begin with a review of select literature pertaining to the impact of ASD on marriages and we include a brief account of popular media portrayals of the influence of having a child with a developmental disability, and ASD in particular, on marriages. We then describe our qualitative examination of narrative interview data from 26 married fathers raising children with ASD aged 2-13 beginning with our theoretical anchoring in social comparison to focus our attention on how fathers compare themselves with media accounts of elevated divorce rates among parents of children and also with other hypothetical family configurations. Our findings are evidence of fathers' strong and strengthened commitments to marriages and we illustrate a re-purposing of inflated portrayals of divorce rates to shore up fathers' sense of their own effectiveness as husbands and fathers.
Perspectives on Inclusive Education of Preschool Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders and Other Developmental Disabilities in Iran.: Iranian children with disabilities invariably attend special schools and many may be excluded from education entirely. Information on preschool education is limited but probably mirrors the situation in schools. There is a lack of information in terms of parental preferences for schooling and teachers' experiences of inclusion in Iran.
Development of a Brief Parent-Report Screen for Common Gastrointestinal Disorders in Autism Spectrum Disorder.Gastrointestinal dysfunction in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is common and associated with problem behaviors. This study describes the development of a brief, parent-report screen that relies minimally upon the child's ability to report or localize pain for identifying children with ASD at risk for one of three common gastrointestinal disorders (functional constipation, functional diarrhea, and gastroesophageal reflux disease). In a clinical sample of children with ASD, this 17-item screen identified children having one or more of these disorders with a sensitivity of 84%, specificity of 43%, and a positive predictive value of 67%. If found to be valid in an independent sample of children with ASD, the screen will be useful in both clinical practice and research.
The pursuit of the magic pill: the overuse of psychotropic medications in children with intellectual and developmental disabilities in the USA.Children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) are likely to receive high-risk prescribing practices, such as polypharmacy, long-term use of psychotropic medications, and overuse of antipsychotics. Behavioural interventions, such as applied behavioural analysis, are evidence-based practices for children with IDD and should be the first-line treatment. Short-term use of psychotropic medications may be helpful in reducing the severity and frequency of challenging behaviours while evidence-based behavioural interventions are pursued. In this essay, we offer practical guidelines for better care.
Neural self-representation in autistic women and association with 'compensatory camouflaging'.Prior work has revealed sex/gender-dependent autistic characteristics across behavioural and neural/biological domains. It remains unclear whether and how neural sex/gender differences are related to behavioural sex/gender differences in autism. Here, we examined whether atypical neural responses during mentalizing and self-representation are sex/gender-dependent in autistic adults and explored whether 'camouflaging' (acting as if behaviourally neurotypical) is associated with sex/gender-dependent neural responses. In total, N = 119 adults (33 typically developing males, 29 autistic males, 29 typically developing females and 28 autistic females) participated in a task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm to assess neural activation within right temporo-parietal junction and ventromedial prefrontal cortex during mentalizing and self-representation. Camouflaging in autism was quantified as the discrepancy between extrinsic behaviour in social-interpersonal contexts and intrinsic status. While autistic men showed hypoactive right temporo-parietal junction mentalizing and ventromedial prefrontal cortex self-representation responses compared to typically developing men, such neural responses in autistic women were not different from typically developing women. In autistic women only, increasing camouflaging was associated with heightened ventromedial prefrontal cortex self-representation response. There is a lack of impaired neural self-representation and mentalizing in autistic women compared to typically developing women. Camouflaging is heightened in autistic women and may relate to neural self-representation response. These results reveal brain-behaviour relations that help explain sex/gender-heterogeneity in social brain function in autism.
GABA Neuronal Deletion of Shank3 is an excitatory postsynaptic scaffolding protein implicated in multiple brain disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS). Although previous neurobiological studies on Shank3 and
Supporting Minimally Verbal Autistic Girls with Intellectual Disabilities Through Puberty: Perspectives of Parents and Educators.Limited research has examined puberty in autistic girls, yet alone those who are minimally verbal and with additional intellectual disabilities. In this study, ten parents and ten educators were interviewed about their views and experiences of supporting these girls through puberty. Results demonstrated that many parents had concerns prior to the onset of puberty in these girls. Yet, for most girls, experiences of puberty were felt to be positive, with the girls coping well with changes that they were experiencing (e.g. menstruation, breast development and developing body hair). Thematic analysis of interview data highlighted three main themes: a range of individual experiences and needs; the importance of promoting dignity and respect; and identifying ways to support these girls through puberty.
Diagnostic and Severity-Tracking Biomarkers for Autism Spectrum Disorder.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder afflicting about one in every 68 children. It is behaviorally diagnosed based on a triad of symptoms, including impairment in communication, impairment in sociability and abnormal and stereotypic behavior. The subjectivity of behavioral diagnosis urges the need for clinical biomarker tests to improve and complement ASD diagnosis and treatment. Over the past two decades, researchers garnered a broad range of biomarkers associated with ASD and often correlating with the severity of ASD, which includes metabolic and genetic biomarkers or neuroimaging abnormalities. Metabolic biomarkers are either involved in key pathways such as a trans-sulfuration pathway or produced due to the derangement of these pathways in the case of oxidative stress. Recent studies reported several genetic abnormalities related to ASD, encompassing various mechanisms, from copy number variations (CNVs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to chromosomal anomalies. However, it is still premature to consider these genetic variants as true biomarkers for ASD, due to their low reproducibility and regional-specific nature. Herein, we comprehensively review state of the art about major biomarkers reported in ASD and the association of some biomarkers with ASD symptoms and severity. It is important to establish those biomarkers to be able to help in the diagnosis and to optimize the treatment of ASD.
SZT2 mutation in a boy with intellectual disability, seizures and autistic features.The seizure threshold 2 (SZT2) gene has been shown to confer a low seizure threshold and may enhance epileptogenesis in mice. However, its biological function is still not known. Mutations in SZT2 have been reported in very few patients and features range from mild to moderate intellectual disability without seizures to severe intellectual disability with epileptic encephalopathies with severe developmental delay. Here, we report a six-year-old boy with a novel homozygous mutation in SZT2 gene with intellectual disability, seizures, absent speech and autistic features. We are reporting the first patient with autistic features including very little or no eye contact, arm flapping and repetitive behaviour.
Lacosamide for SCN2A-related intractable neonatal and infantile seizures.Voltage-gated sodium channel alpha subunit 2 (SCN2A) gene mutations are associated with neonatal seizures and a wide range of epilepsy syndromes. Previous reports suggest that traditional sodium channel blockers (SCBs) such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine have a beneficial effect on SCN2A-related neonatal seizures, as they counteract the gain-of-function effect of mutated Nav1.2 channels. Additionally, SCBs are beneficial against other sodium and potassium channel-related neonatal seizures. There are, however, few reports describing the effect of the new SCB lacosamide against neonatal and infantile epileptic seizures. We report herein two neonates with intractable neonatal seizures with SCN2A pathogenic missense variants. Both infants showed temporary seizure relief following IV administrations of phenytoin, but were resistant to a combination of antiepileptic drugs, while complete seizure control was achieved following lacosamide administration. We suggest that SCBs, e.g. phenytoin, should be introduced early for refractory neonatal seizures of non-lesional and presumably genetic origin. If any beneficial response to a SCB is noted, this should prompt an initiation of additional SCBs. New clinical trials will provide data on the efficacy and safety of the new SCB lacosamide for genetic neonatal seizures and perhaps neonatal seizures in general.
Assessing intelligence at autism diagnosis: mission impossible? Testability and cognitive profile of autistic preschoolers.Intelligence in minimally verbal children on the autism spectrum (AS) is at risk of being underestimated. The present study investigated testability and cognitive profile of preschool autistic children using conventional tools and strength-informed tools. Fifty-two AS children and fifty-four typical children matched on age (31-77 months) were assessed. Testability increased with age in both groups, was generally lower in AS children, but not related to their test performance. Typical children performed significantly better than AS children on conventional tools, but performance of both groups was similar on strength-informed tools. Differences of performance across tests were much greater in the AS group. These results emphasize the heterogenous, yet characteristic, cognitive profile in preschool children, and introduce the usefulness of flexible testing.
Development and Validation of the Camouflaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire (CAT-Q).There currently exist no self-report measures of social camouflaging behaviours (strategies used to compensate for or mask autistic characteristics during social interactions). The Camouflaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire (CAT-Q) was developed from autistic adults' experiences of camouflaging, and was administered online to 354 autistic and 478 non-autistic adults. Exploratory factor analysis suggested three factors, comprising of 25 items in total. Good model fit was demonstrated through confirmatory factor analysis, with measurement invariance analyses demonstrating equivalent factor structures across gender and diagnostic group. Internal consistency (α = 0.94) and preliminary test-retest reliability (r = 0.77) were acceptable. Convergent validity was demonstrated through comparison with measures of autistic traits, wellbeing, anxiety, and depression. The present study provides robust psychometric support for the CAT-Q.
Dissociations in the neural substrates of language and social functioning in autism spectrum disorder.Impairments in social communication (coupled with intact nonsocial language skills) are common in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the neural correlates of these social communication deficits in adolescents and young adults with ASD are not fully understood. The communication checklist self-report (CC-SR) was administered to adolescents and young adults with ASD (n = 52) and typically developing (TD) controls (n = 64) to assess structural-language, pragmatic-language, and social-engagement. One high-resolution T1-weighted structural image was obtained from each participant. FreeSurfer was used to quantify cortical thickness. A main effect of diagnosis, with the ASD group performing worse than the TD group on all three CC-SR scales, and a diagnosis by scale interaction, driven by low social-engagement self-ratings in the ASD group, were found. There were also group differences in the relationship between scores on two of the three CC-SR scales and cortical thickness in multiple regions (pragmatic-language: left rostral frontal; social-engagement: left medial prefrontal). These interactions were driven by poorer self-ratings of language/social skills associated with decreased cortical thickness in the ASD group, while in the TD group worse self-ratings were associated with thicker cortex. Self-ratings of language/social-communication were lower in the ASD than the TD group. Moreover, language/social-communication self-ratings showed a different relationship with cortical thickness for the ASD and TD groups in the left inferior frontal region for pragmatic language ratings and the left medial prefrontal cortex for social engagement ratings. These findings suggest thinner cortex is associated with more impaired pragmatic language and social communication abilities in ASD.

LAY SUMMARY: The present study examines the associations between brain structure and language/social communication ability in adolescents and young adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as compared to neurotypical adolescents and young adults. We utilized thickness of the cerebral cortex as a measure of brain structure, and we found different correlations between language or social communication ability and cortical thickness in distinct regions for the ASD and TD groups. These findings suggest that for regions implicated in language/social communication ability, decreased cortical thickness is associated with more impaired pragmatic language and social communication abilities in ASD.
Correlations between features of event-related potentials and Autism Spectrum Quotient scores.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder and is characterized by deficits in social communication and social interaction. ASD includes a continuum from mild to severe expression of autistic traits. The purpose of the present study was to investigate correlations between event-related potentials (ERPs) during visual-auditory priming, and Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) scores, which include subscores in 5 different areas: social skills, attention switching, attention to detail, communication, and imagination. High-density electroencephalograms were recorded while participants performed a visual-auditory priming task that required categorization of auditory stimuli presented following a semantically congruent or incongruent visual primer. Differences in ERPs to auditory targets following semantically congruent and incongruent primers occurred between 200 ms and 600 ms at the posterior temporal electrodes. Amplitudes associated with incongruent auditory stimuli at P7 were negatively correlated with overall AQ scores, and positively correlated with communication subscores. Amplitudes associated with congruent stimuli were positively correlated with attention to detail subscores. In addition, PO7 amplitudes were negatively correlated with communication subscores. The results demonstrate significant correlations between electrophysiological features of cross-modal priming and AQ scores. Our findings suggest that electrophysiological parameters may be useful tools to evaluate the severity of autistic trait expression.
Effectiveness of the Stepping Stones Triple P Group Parenting Program as an Additional Intervention in the Treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorders: Effects on Parenting Variables.Parents of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) often are faced with the challenges of difficult parenting situations. We explored the effectiveness of the Stepping Stones Triple P (SSTP) group parent training as an additional intervention in the treatment of ASD. Parents (n = 23) went through a waiting period and participated afterwards in the training program. We assessed parenting variables via self-report measures. After the intervention, there was a significant reduction of over-reactive parenting behaviors, role restriction and an increase in parental self-efficacy. At follow-up, the effects remained stable and we additionally found a reduction of laxness and less parenting stress. Effect sizes were high (η
Overlaps and distinctions between attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder in young adulthood: Systematic review and guiding framework for EEG-imaging research.Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorders (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) frequently co-occur. However, we know little about the neural basis of the overlaps and distinctions between these disorders, particularly in young adulthood - a critical time window for brain plasticity across executive and socioemotional domains. Here, we systematically review 75 articles investigating ADHD and ASD in young adult samples (mean ages 16-26) using cognitive tasks, with neural activity concurrently measured via electroencephalography (EEG) - the most accessible neuroimaging technology. The majority of studies focused on event-related potentials (ERPs), with some beginning to capitalise on oscillatory approaches. Overlapping and specific profiles for ASD and ADHD were found mainly for four neurocognitive domains: attention processing, performance monitoring, face processing and sensory processing. No studies in this age group directly compared both disorders or considered dual diagnosis with both disorders. Moving forward, understanding of ADHD, ASD and their overlap in young adulthood would benefit from an increased focus on cross-disorder comparisons, using similar paradigms and in well-powered samples and longitudinal cohorts.
Social Stimulus Causes Aberrant Activation of the Medial Prefrontal Cortex in a Mouse Model With Autism-Like Behaviors.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly prevalent and genetically heterogeneous brain disorder. Developing effective therapeutic interventions requires knowledge of the brain regions that malfunction and how they malfunction during ASD-relevant behaviors. Our study provides insights into brain regions activated by a novel social stimulus and how the activation pattern differs between mice that display autism-like disabilities and control littermates. Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) conditional knockout (cKO) mice display reduced social interest, increased repetitive behaviors and dysfunction of the β-catenin pathway, a convergent target of numerous ASD-linked human genes. Here, we exposed the mice to a novel social vs. non-social stimulus and measured neuronal activation by immunostaining for the protein c-Fos. We analyzed three brain regions known to play a role in social behavior. Compared with control littermates, APC cKOs display excessive activation, as evidenced by an increased number of excitatory pyramidal neurons stained for c-Fos in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), selectively in the infralimbic sub-region. In contrast, two other social brain regions, the medial amygdala and piriform cortex show normal levels of neuron activation. Additionally, APC cKOs exhibit increased frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the infralimbic sub-region. Further, immunostaining is reduced for the inhibitory interneuron markers parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SST) in the APC cKO mPFC. Our findings suggest aberrant excitatory-inhibitory balance and activation patterns. As β-catenin is a core pathway in ASD, we identify the infralimbic sub-region of the mPFC as a critical brain region for autism-relevant social behavior.
Altered lateralization of dorsal language tracts in 6-week-old infants at risk for autism.Altered structural connectivity has been identified as a possible biomarker of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk in the developing brain. Core features of ASD include impaired social communication and early language delay. Thus, examining white matter tracts associated with language may lend further insight into early signs of ASD risk and the mechanisms that underlie language impairments associated with the disorder. Evidence of altered structural connectivity has previously been detected in 6-month-old infants at high familial risk for developing ASD. However, as language processing begins in utero, differences in structural connectivity between language regions may be present in the early infant brain shortly after birth. Here we investigated key white matter pathways of the dorsal language network in 6-week-old infants at high (HR) and low (LR) risk for ASD to identify atypicalities in structural connectivity that may predict altered developmental trajectories prior to overt language delays and the onset of ASD symptomatology. Compared to HR infants, LR infants showed higher fractional anisotropy (FA) in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF); in contrast, in the right SLF, HR infants showed higher FA than LR infants. Additionally, HR infants showed more rightward lateralization of the SLF. Across both groups, measures of FA and lateralization of these pathways at 6 weeks of age were related to later language development at 18 months of age as well as ASD symptomatology at 36 months of age. These findings indicate that early differences in the structure of language pathways may provide an early predictor of future language development and ASD risk.
Enhanced Early Visual Responses During Implicit Emotional Faces Processing in Autism Spectrum Disorder.Research on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has focused on processing of socially-relevant stimuli, such as faces. Nonetheless, before being 'social', faces are visual stimuli. The present magnetoencephalography study investigated the time course of brain activity during an implicit emotional task in visual emotion-related regions in 19 adults with ASD (mean age 26.3 ± 4.4) and 19 typically developed controls (26.4 ± 4). The results confirmed previously-reported differences between groups in brain responses to emotion and a hypo-activation in the ASD group in the right fusiform gyrus around 150 ms. However, the ASD group also presented early enhanced activity in the occipital region. These results support that impaired face processing in ASD might be sustained by atypical responses in primary visual areas.
NSDHL-containing duplication at Xq28 in a male patient with autism spectrum disorder: a case report.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder in which genetics plays a key aetiological role. The gene encoding NAD(P)H steroid dehydrogenase-like protein (NSDHL) is expressed in developing cortical neurons and glia, and its mutation may result in intellectual disability or congenital hemidysplasia.
Community providers' intentions to use a parent-mediated intervention for children with ASD following training: an application of the theory of planned behavior.The theory of planned behavior (TPB) suggests that attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control influence intentions to perform a behavior, and that intentions predict behavior. The present studies examined whether the TPB is applicable to community providers' use of a parent-mediated intervention for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) following introductory training and whether TPB constructs can be modified with training.
Natural histories of patients with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome derived from variable chromosomal abnormalities.Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) is a subtelomeric deletion syndrome affecting the short arm of chromosome 4. The main clinical features are a typical craniofacial appearance, growth deficiency, developmental delays, and seizures. Previous genotype-phenotype correlation analyses showed some candidate regions for each clinical finding. The WHS critical region has been narrowed into the region 2 Mb from the telomere, which includes LETM1 and WHSC1; however, this region is insufficient to cause "typical WHS facial appearance". In this study, we identified 10 patients with a deletion involving 4p16.3. Five patients showed pure terminal deletions and three showed unbalanced translocations. The remaining patients showed an interstitial deletion and a suspected inverted-duplication-deletion. Among 10 patients, one patient did not show "typical WHS facial appearance" although his interstitial deletion included LETM1 and WHSC1. On the other hand, another patient exhibited "typical WHS facial appearance" although her small deletion did not include LETM1 and WHSC1. Instead, FGFRL1 was considered as the candidate for this finding. The largest deletion of 34.7 Mb was identified in a patient with the most severe phenotype of WHS.
Labelling faces as 'Autistic' reduces the inversion effect.Does the belief that a face belongs to an individual with autism affect recognition of that face? To address this question, we used the inversion effect as a marker of face recognition. In Experiment 1, participants completed a recognition task involving upright and inverted faces labelled as either 'regular' or 'autistic'. In reality, the faces presented in both conditions were identical. Results revealed a smaller inversion effect for faces labelled as autistic. Thus, simply labelling a face as 'autistic' disrupts recognition. Experiment 2 showed a larger inversion effect after the provision of humanizing versus dehumanizing information about faces labelled as 'autistic'. We suggest changes in the inversion effect could be used as a measure to study stigma within the context of objectification and dehumanization.
Mock Juror Perceptions of Credibility and Culpability in an Autistic Defendant.One-hundred-and-sixty jury-eligible participants read a vignette describing a male who was brought to the attention of police for suspicious and aggressive behaviours and displayed atypical behaviours in court. Half of participants were informed that he had autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and were given background information about ASD; the other half received no diagnostic label or information. The provision of a label and information led to higher ratings of the defendant's honesty and likeability, reduced blameworthiness, and resulted in fewer guilty verdicts, and more lenient sentencing. Thematic analysis revealed that participants in the label condition were more empathetic and attributed his behaviours to his ASD and mitigating factors, while participants in the No label condition perceived the defendant as deceitful, unremorseful, rude and aggressive.
First episode psychosis and comorbid ADHD, autism and intellectual disability.Comorbidity between neurodevelopmental disorders and psychotic disorders is common, but little is known about how neurodevelopmental disorders influence the presentation and outcome of first episode psychosis.
Perspectives on the Measles, Mumps and Rubella Vaccination among Somali Mothers in Stockholm.: Vaccination hesitancy and skepticism among parents hinders progress in achieving full vaccination coverage. Swedish measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine coverage is high however some areas with low vaccination coverage risk outbreaks. This study aimed to explore factors influencing the decision of Somali parents living in the Rinkeby and Tensta districts of Stockholm, Sweden, on whether or not to vaccinate their children with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.
Thinking Ahead: Incremental Language Processing is Associated with Receptive Language Abilities in Preschoolers with Autism Spectrum Disorder.In typical development, listeners can use semantic content of verbs to facilitate incremental language processing-a skill that is associated with existing language skills. Studies of children with ASD have not identified an association between incremental language processing in semantically-constraining contexts and language skills, perhaps because participants were adolescents and/or children with strong language skills. This study examined incremental language processing and receptive language in young children with ASD with a range of language skills. Children showed a head start when presented with semantically-constraining verbs (e.g., Read the book) compared to neutral verbs (e.g., Find the book). Children with weaker receptive language showed a smaller head start than children with stronger receptive language skills, suggesting continuity between typical development and ASD.
Brain Connectivity and Neuroimaging of Social Networks in Autism.Impairments in social communication (SC) predominate among the core diagnostic features of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Neuroimaging has revealed numerous findings of atypical activity and connectivity of 'social brain' networks, yet no consensus view on crucial developmental causes of SC deficits has emerged. Aside from methodological challenges, the deeper problem concerns the clinical label of ASD. While genetic studies have not comprehensively explained the causes of nonsyndromic ASDs, they highlight that the clinical label encompasses many etiologically different disorders. The question of how potential causes and etiologies converge onto a comparatively narrow set of SC deficits remains. Only neuroimaging designs searching for subtypes within ASD cohorts (rather than conventional group level designs) can provide translationally informative answers.
A perspective on pre-eclampsia and neurodevelopmental outcomes in the offspring: Does maternal inflammation play a role?Pre-eclampsia is a leading cause of maternal death and maternal and perinatal morbidity. Whilst the clinical manifestations of pre-eclampsia often occur in late pregnancy, the molecular events leading into the onset of this disease are thought to originate in early pregnancy and result in insufficient placentation. Although the causative molecular basis of pre-eclampsia remains poorly understood, maternal inflammation is recognised as a core clinical feature. While the adverse effects of pre-eclampsia on maternal and fetal health in pregnancy is well-recognised, the long-term impact of pre-eclampsia exposure on the risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in exposed offspring is a topic of on-going debate. In particular, a recent systematic review has reported an association between exposure to pre-eclampsia and increased risk of ASD, however the molecular basis of this association is unknown. Here we review recent evidence for; 1) maternal inflammation in pre-eclampsia; 2) epidemiological evidence for alterations in neurodevelopmental outcomes in offspring exposed to pre-eclampsia; 3) long-term changes in the brains of offspring exposed to pre-eclampsia; and 4) how maternal inflammation may lead to altered neurodevelopmental outcomes in pre-eclampsia exposed offspring. Finally, we discuss the implications of this for the development of future studies in this field.
Emotional Expressivity in Toddlers With Autism Spectrum Disorder.There is a prevailing notion that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit intense negative and attenuated positive emotions, although the empirical evidence regarding their emotional expressiveness (EE) is limited. Given the importance of emotions in shaping social and cognitive development, we examined intensity and valence of EE and links between EE and autism severity and parent-reported temperament in ASD.
[Deep neck space abscesses in children: 15 years of experience in a children's ENT referral unit].Deep neck space abscesses in infants are clinical entities of great importance due to their severity and possible complications. The aim of the study is to review our experience in the diagnostic and therapeutic management of deep neck space abscesses, and compare it with published literature.
A review of psychiatric conceptions of mental and behavioural disorders in Prader-Willi syndrome.We present a review of psychiatric associations with comorbid mental and behavioural disorders affecting people with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). This literature review suggests that some assumptions about psychiatric associations of PWS behaviours are unjustified (eg skin picking as OCD) and that genetic aetiology should be considered when making associations between PWS mental and behavioural disorders and psychiatric disorders in the general populationThe literature review also demonstrates the limitations of the studies in terms of small numbers, non-representativeness, and lack of replication.
Complete Disruption of Autism-Susceptibility Genes by Gene Editing Predominantly Reduces Functional Connectivity of Isogenic Human Neurons.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous. We present a CRISPR gene editing strategy to insert a protein tag and premature termination sites creating an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) knockout resource for functional studies of ten ASD-relevant genes (AFF2/FMR2, ANOS1, ASTN2, ATRX, CACNA1C, CHD8, DLGAP2, KCNQ2, SCN2A, TENM1). Neurogenin 2 (NGN2)-directed induction of iPSCs allowed production of excitatory neurons, and mutant proteins were not detectable. RNA sequencing revealed convergence of several neuronal networks. Using both patch-clamp and multi-electrode array approaches, the electrophysiological deficits measured were distinct for different mutations. However, they culminated in a consistent reduction in synaptic activity, including reduced spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current frequencies in AFF2/FMR2-, ASTN2-, ATRX-, KCNQ2-, and SCN2A-null neurons. Despite ASD susceptibility genes belonging to different gene ontologies, isogenic stem cell resources can reveal common functional phenotypes, such as reduced functional connectivity.
Facial Expression Production in Autism: A Meta-Analysis.This meta-analysis summarized studies that examined group differences on the production of facial expressions in participants with ASD compared to typically developing or nonautistic clinical comparison groups. The overall summary effect from 67 effect sizes representing the average ASD-comparison group differences in facial expressions was -0.481, indicating a moderate effect size. We conducted subgroup analyses to group effect sizes according to separate facial expression abilities identified in the literature. These analyses revealed that participants with ASD display facial expressions less frequently and for less amount of time, and they are less likely to share facial expressions with others or automatically mimic the expressions of real faces or face stimuli. Their facial expressions are also judged to be lower in quality and are expressed less accurately. However, participants with ASD do not express emotions less intensely, nor is their reaction time of expression onset slower in response to odors, startling sensations, or in response to face stimuli in mimicry studies. ASD-comparison group differences were moderated by matching procedures, age, and intellectual functioning of the ASD participants suggesting that persons with higher IQ and larger number of accumulated life experiences are better able to produce facial expressions that are more consistent with "neurotypical" norms. Group differences were also stronger for "covertly elicited" than "explicitly elicited" facial expressions suggesting individuals with ASD may naturally produce facial expressions differently from other populations, but are less impaired in expressing emotions typically when prompted to do so in a laboratory setting. Autism Research 2018, 11: 1586-1601. © 2018 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: We reviewed studies that compared facial expressions in people with and without autism. Results revealed that facial expressions of people with autism are atypical in appearance and quality and are used atypically to regulate social interactions. The magnitude of these differences was influenced by participant characteristics (e.g. age and intellectual functioning), and by how facial expressions were measured and analyzed in various studies.
Review of interventions for the management of anxiety symptoms in children with ASD.Anxiety is a common accompanying symptom in people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).
Volumetric Analysis of the Basal Ganglia and Cerebellar Structures in Patients with Phelan-McDermid Syndrome.Phelan-McDermid syndrome is caused by haploinsufficiency of SHANK3 on terminal chromosome 22. Knowledge about altered neuroanatomic circuitry in Phelan-McDermid syndrome comes from mouse models showing striatal hypertrophy in the basal ganglia, and from humans with evidence of cerebellar atrophy. To date, no studies have performed volumetric analysis on Phelan-McDermid syndrome patients.
Recognition and treatment of mood dysregulation in adults with intellectual disability.Mood dysregulation is a common feature in the psychopathology of people with intellectual disability (ID) and co-occurring behavioral/psychiatric disorders. It can present with a host of dangerous behaviors, including aggression, self-injury, and property damage. There are special techniques that are used to assess these behaviors in people with ID, that can eventually inform an appropriate approach to pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment. Two case studies are presented that illustrate the elements in the assessment and treatment of mood dysregulation in ID.
Investigating alexithymia in autism: A systematic review and meta-analysis.New research suggests that, rather than representing a core feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), emotional processing difficulties reflect co-occurring alexithymia. Autistic individuals with alexithymia could therefore represent a specific subgroup of autism who may benefit from tailored interventions. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to explore the nature and prevalence of alexithymia in autism using the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS).
Social behavior, neuroimmune markers and glutamic acid decarboxylase levels in a rat model of valproic acid-induced autism.Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social communication and social interactions, and repetitive behaviors. The etiology of autism remains unknown and its molecular basis is not yet well understood. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were administered 600 mg/kg of valproic acid (VPA) by intraperitoneal injection on day 12.5 of gestation. Both 11- to 13-week-old male and female rat models of VPA-induced autism showed impaired sociability and impaired preference for social novelty as compared to the corresponding control SD rats. Significantly reduced mRNA expressions of social behavior-related genes, such as those encoding the serotonin receptor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neuroligin3, and significantly increased expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1 β and tumor necrosis factor-α, were noted in the hippocampi of both male and female rats exposed to VPA in utero. The hippocampal expression level of gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 67 protein was reduced in both male and female VPA-exposed rats as compared to the corresponding control animals. Our results indicate that developmental exposure to VPA affects the social behavior in rats by modulating the expression levels of social behavior-related genes and inflammatory mediators accompanied with changes in GABA enzyme in the hippocampus.
Factors affecting quality of life of caregivers of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.Since autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a lifelong disease and because of its nature, the negative effects of the disease on the quality of life (QoL) of caregivers as well as patients are incontrovertible.
Dietary Zinc Supplementation Prevents Autism Related Behaviors and Striatal Synaptic Dysfunction in The SHANK family of synaptic proteins (SHANK1-3) are master regulators of the organizational structure of excitatory synapses in the brain. Mutations in
Gastrointestinal and Psychiatric Symptoms Among Children and Adolescents With Autism Spectrum Disorder.Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at heightened risk of psychiatric comorbidities across the lifespan, including elevated rates of internalizing, externalizing, and self-injurious behaviors. Identification of medical comorbidities that contribute to these concerns may elucidate mechanisms through which psychiatric concerns arise, as well as offer additional avenues for intervention. Gastrointestinal (GI) conditions are of particular interest, as they are prevalent among those with ASD, may share genetic or neurobiological etiologies with the core features of ASD, and are linked with psychiatric difficulties in the general population. In this paper, we draw on data from nearly 2,800 children and adolescents with ASD within the Simons Simplex Collection to characterize the unique contributions of (1) autism symptoms, (2) psychosocial factors (child's age, sex, verbal and nonverbal IQ, adaptive behavior, race, and household income), and (3) GI concerns with respect to multiple psychiatric outcomes. Multiple regression models revealed unique contributions of ASD symptoms and multiple psychosocial factors such as verbal IQ, adaptive behavior, and family income to internalizing, externalizing, and self-injurious behavior. In general, higher levels of psychiatric symptoms were associated with more ASD symptoms, higher verbal IQ, lower adaptive behavior skills, and lower family income. Furthermore, levels of GI symptoms accounted for unique variance in psychiatric outcomes over and above these other factors, linking increased GI problems with increased psychiatric symptoms in children with ASD. Taken together, results indicate that the presence and quantity of GI symptoms should be considered when evaluating psychiatric and behavioral concerns among children with ASD, and that treatment of GI conditions may be an important component in alleviating a broad array of mental health concerns in this group.
Effects of Delay, Question Type, and Socioemotional Support on Episodic Memory Retrieval by Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.Twenty-seven autistic children and 32 typically developing (TD) peers were questioned about an experienced event after a two-week delay and again after a two-month delay, using the Revised National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Investigative Interview Protocol. Recall prompts elicited more detailed and more accurate responses from children than recognition prompts. Autistic children recalled fewer correct narrative details than TD peers when questioned using open invitations, cued invitations, and directive questions. Nonetheless, they were as accurate as TD peers when responding to all types of prompts. The informativeness and accuracy of children's reports remained unchanged over time. Social support was beneficial when children were interviewed for the first time but not after a longer delay.
Anxiety and Interpretation of Ambiguity in Autistic Children, Typical Children and Their Mothers.Anxiety is highly prevalent in autistic children. Yet interpretation biases implicated in anxiety in non-autistic individuals have received little research attention in this group. Twenty-two autistic children and 25 typical children completed an ambiguous scenarios interview and questionnaire-based measures of anxiety. A subsample of mothers completed parent-report and adult relevant versions of the interview and anxiety questionnaires. Autistic children self-reported similar interpretations of ambiguous scenarios, and similar levels of anxiety, to their typical peers. In contrast, mothers of autistic children reported greater levels of anxiety, and more negative interpretations of ambiguous scenarios in both their children and themselves, relative to mothers of typical children. These data highlight the importance of including autistic children's self-reports when measuring and treating anxiety.
Relation between Early Over- and Undertreatment and Behavioural Problems in Preadolescent Children with Congenital Hypothyroidism.Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) per se, when not treated or undertreated, may lead to severe behavioural problems (cretinism), whereas overtreatment of CH seems associated with attention problems.
Syllogistic reasoning reveals reduced bias in people with higher autistic-like traits from the general population.Recent theories of autism have emphasised the cognitive strengths and weaknesses in those with autism, which are also seen to some degree in non-clinical samples with higher autistic-like traits. The dual process theory of autism proposes that people with autism and non-clinical people with a higher degree of autistic-like traits have a propensity to show reduced intuitive processing (automatic and typically faster) alongside enhanced propensity towards deliberative processing (dependent on general cognitive ability and typically slower). This study aimed to further test the dual process theory of autism by investigating syllogistic reasoning (whether a conclusion can be logically deduced from two propositions) in addition to the cognitive reflection test (correct responses to which reflect deliberative processing over-riding intuitive processing) with respect to the degree of autistic-like traits and general cognitive ability in a non-clinical sample of 189 adults. Results showed that higher levels of autistic-like traits were related to lower levels of intuitive processing and higher levels of deliberative processing, which was found across both the syllogistic reasoning and cognitive reflection test measures - over and above the effect of general cognitive ability. The findings are consistent with the dual process theory of autism, and implications for autism are discussed.
Early life exposure to particulate matter air pollution (PMThe evidence for adverse effects of ambient particulate matter (PM) pollution on mental health is limited. Studies in Western countries suggested higher risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) associated with PM air pollution, but no such study has been done in developing countries.
A cross-cultural study of autistic traits across India, Japan and the UK.There is a global need for brief screening instruments that can identify key indicators for autism to support frontline professionals in their referral decision-making. Although a universal set of conditions, there may be subtle differences in expression, identification and reporting of autistic traits across cultures. In order to assess the potential for any measure for cross-cultural screening use, it is important to understand the relative performance of such measures in different cultures. Our study aimed to identify the items on the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ)-Child that are most predictive of an autism diagnosis among children aged 4-9 years across samples from India, Japan and the UK.
Do you know what I'm thinking? Temporal and spatial brain activity during a theory-of-mind task in children with autism.The social impairments observed in children with autism spectrum disorder are thought to arise in part from deficits in theory of mind, the ability to understand other people's thoughts and feelings. To determine the temporal-spatial dynamics of brain activity underlying these atypical theory-of-mind processes, we used magnetoencephalography to characterize the sequence of functional brain patterns (i.e. when and where) related to theory-of-mind reasoning in 19 high-functioning children with autism compared to 22 age- and sex-matched typically-developing children aged 8-12 during a false-belief (theory-of-mind) task. While task performance did not differ between the two groups, children with autism showed reduced activation in the left temporoparietal junction between 300-375 and 425-500 ms, as well as increased activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus from 325 to 375 ms compared to controls. The overlap in decreased temporoparietal junction activity and increased right inferior frontal gyrus activation from 325 to 375 ms suggests that in children with autism, the right inferior frontal gyrus may compensate for deficits in the temporoparietal junction, a neural theory-of-mind network hub. As the right inferior frontal gyrus is involved in inhibitory control, this finding suggests that children with autism rely on executive functions to bolster their false-belief understanding.
Outpatient Psychotherapy for Adults with High-Functioning Autism Spectrum Condition: Utilization, Treatment Satisfaction, and Preferred Modifications.Many adults with autism spectrum condition (ASC) desire outpatient psychotherapy (PT). This study compared reasons for seeking PT, experiences with PT, and modifications preferred with respect to PT of individuals with ASC to non-autistic individuals with depression (MDD). Furthermore, factors predictive for treatment satisfaction were identified in individuals with ASC. A total of 262 adults with ASC without intellectual impairment and 304 non-autistic controls with MDD were surveyed. In this pilot study both groups predominantly sought treatment for depressiveness. A low level of expertise with autism was the main reason for being declined by therapists and a contributing factor to the overall treatment dissatisfaction of patients with ASC. ASC patients desire adjustments such as written communication, and clearly structured sessions.
Neural Correlates of Social Perception in Children with Autism: Local versus Global Preferences.The Weak Central Coherence account of autism spectrum disorders posits that individuals with ASD utilize a detail-oriented information processing bias. While this local bias is helpful in visual search tasks, ASD individuals falter in social cognition tasks where coherence is advantageous. The present study examined the neural correlates of Weak Central Coherence in ASD during visual and social processing. Fifteen ASD and sixteen typically developing children/adolescents completed a social/visual information processing task in an fMRI scanner. The stimuli consisted of human characters, composed of geometrical shapes, displaying different emotions. In the locally oriented Shape condition, participants indicated whether a given shape was present in a figure. In the Emotion condition, participants identified the emotion conveyed by the character in the figure at the global level. Whole-brain within- and between-group activation and seed-to-voxel functional connectivity analyses were conducted in SPM12 and the CONN toolbox. The ASD group was significantly faster in shape identification, but less accurate in emotion identification. The TD group showed significantly increased areas of activity over the ASD group in the Shape task in regions associated with executive control, such as the medial prefrontal cortex and middle frontal gyrus, suggesting increased interference from the global/social information. During the Emotion condition, the ASD group showed decreased connectivity between frontal and posterior regions and between body perception and motor networks, suggesting a possible difference in mirroring. The findings suggest that social cognitive factors, not visual processing biases, underlie the observed behavioral differences.
Testing the Empathizing-Systemizing theory of sex differences and the Extreme Male Brain theory of autism in half a million people.The Empathizing-Systemizing (E-S) theory of typical sex differences suggests that individuals may be classified based on empathy and systemizing. An extension of the E-S theory, the Extreme Male Brain (EMB) theory suggests that autistic people on average have a shift towards a more masculinized brain along the E-S dimensions. Both theories have been investigated in small sample sizes, limiting their generalizability. Here we leverage two large datasets (discovery
Predicting Imminent Aggression Onset in Minimally-Verbal Youth with Autism Spectrum Disorder Using Preceding Physiological Signals.We test the hypothesis that changes in preceding physiological arousal can be used to predict imminent aggression proximally before it occurs in youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who are minimally verbal (MV-ASD). We evaluate this hypothesis through statistical analyses performed on physiological biosensor data wirelessly recorded from 20 MV-ASD youth over 69 independent naturalistic observations in a hospital inpatient unit. Using ridge-regularized logistic regression, results demonstrate that, on average, our models are able to predict the onset of aggression 1 minute before it occurs using 3 minutes of prior data with a 0.71 AUC for global, and a 0.84 AUC for person-dependent models.
Childhood Executive Function Predicts Later Autistic Features and Adaptive Behavior in Young Autistic People: a 12-Year Prospective Study.Longitudinal studies of autistic people show that the behavioral features of autism generally endure into adulthood. Yet the prognostic indicators remain far from certain, especially for cognitively able individuals. Here, we test the predictive power of specific cognitive skills, namely theory of mind and executive function, measured in childhood, on young people's autistic features and adaptive behavior 12 years later. Twenty-eight young autistic people (2 female) were seen twice within the space of 12 years. At Time 1 (M = 5 years; 7 months, SD = 11 months), participants were assessed on components of executive function (planning, inhibition and cognitive flexibility) and theory of mind (false-belief understanding). At Time 2, 12 years later (M = 17 years 10 months, SD = 1 year; 2 months), we measured participants' autistic features and adaptive behavior. Only Time 1 executive function skills predicted significant variance in autistic adolescents' autistic features, over and above variance attributable to early age, intellectual ability and theory of mind skills. Furthermore, early EF skills, in addition to early verbal ability and nonverbal ability, predicted significant variance in young people's adaptive behavior at the 12-year follow-up. These long-term longitudinal findings clearly demonstrate that executive function measured in early childhood has prognostic significance in a sample of young autistic people approaching emerging adulthood and underscore their importance as a key target for early intervention and support.
Prenatal metformin exposure or organic cation transporter 3 knock-out curbs social interaction preference in male mice.Poorly managed gestational diabetes can lead to severe complications for mother and child including fetal overgrowth, neonatal hypoglycemia and increased autism risk. Use of metformin to control it is relatively new and promising. Yet safety concerns regarding gestational metformin use remain, as its long-term effects in offspring are unclear. In light of beneficial findings with metformin for adult mouse social behavior, we hypothesized gestational metformin treatment might also promote offspring sociability. To test this, metformin was administered to non-diabetic, lean C57BL/6 J female mice at mating, with treatment discontinued at birth or wean. Male offspring exposed to metformin through birth lost social interaction preference relative to controls by time in chambers, but not by sniffing measures. Further, prenatal metformin exposure appeared to enhance social novelty preference only in females. However due to unbalanced litters and lack of statistical power, firm establishment of any sex-dependency of metformin's effects on sociability was not possible. Since organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3) transports metformin and is dense in placenta, social preferences of OCT3 knock-out males were measured. Relative to wild-type, OCT3 knock-outs had reduced interaction preference. Our data indicate gestational metformin exposure under non-diabetic conditions, or lack of OCT3, can impair social behavior in male C57BL6/J mice. Since OCT3 transports serotonin and tryptophan, impaired placental OCT3 function is one common mechanism that could persistently impact central serotonin systems and social behavior. Yet no gross alterations in serotonergic function were evident by measure of serotonin transporter density in OCT3, or serotonin turnover in metformin-exposed offspring brains. Mechanisms underlying the behavioral outcomes, and if with gestational diabetes the same would occur, remain unclear. Metformin's impacts on placental transporters and serotonin metabolism or AMPK activity in fetal brain need further investigation to clarify benefits and risks to offspring sociability from use of metformin to treat gestational diabetes.
Sudden Events Change Old Visual Objects Into New Ones: A Possible Role for Phasic Activation of Locus Coeruleus.We report a novel visual phenomenon called the rejuvenation effect. It causes an "old" object that has been on view for some time to acquire the properties of a suddenly appearing new object. In each experiment, a square outline was displayed continuously on one side of fixation. The target (an asterisk) was presented either inside the square or on the opposite side of fixation. On half of the trials, a transient visual or auditory event preceded the target. In Experiment 1a ( N = 139), response times were faster when the target appeared inside the square, but only when it was preceded by a transient event, consistent with the network-reset theory of locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) phasic activation. Three further experiments confirmed the predictions of network-reset theory, including the absence of rejuvenation in participants with atypical LC-NE functioning (individuals with symptoms of autism spectrum disorder). These findings provide new perspectives on what causes a visual object to be perceived as new.
Autism Spectrum Disorders: Potential Neuro-Psychopharmacotherapeutic Plant-Based Drugs.Over the years, scientific researches have validated the healing benefits of many psychopharmacotherapeutic plant-based drugs to ameliorate psychiatric disorders. In contrast, the use of chemical procedures to isolate and purify specific compounds from plants that have been used to treat autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and its clinical features may contribute to improve the quality of life of many patients. Also, herbal pharmacological treatments could improve the core symptoms of autism with fewer side effects. This review will focus on the uses and actions of phytopharmaceuticals in the behavioral conditions of ASDs. A large number of natural compound-based plant drugs have been tested in murine models of autism and in clinical trials with remarkable success in reversing the core and associated behaviors with autism such as flavonoids, cannabinoids, curcuminoids, piperine, resveratrol, and bacosides. This plant-based drug alternative is safer given that many psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative pathologies do not often respond well to currently prescribed medications or have significant side effects. However, it is noteworthy to consider the need for large clinical trials to determine safety and efficacy. Many results are based on case reports or small size samples, and often the studies are open label. Standardization of procedures (i.e., purity and concentrations) and quality controls are strictly required to ensure the absence of side effects.
Rapid Eye Movements in Sleep Furnish a Unique Probe Into Consciousness.The neural correlates of rapid eye movements (REMs) in sleep are extraordinarily robust; including REM-locked multisensory-motor integration and accompanying activation in the retrosplenial cortex, the supplementary eye field and areas encompassing cholinergic basal nucleus (Hong et al., 2009). The phenomenology of REMs speaks to the notion that perceptual experience in both sleep and wakefulness is a constructive process - in which we generate predictions of sensory inputs and then test those predictions through actively sampling the sensorium with eye movements. On this view, REMs during sleep may index an internalized active sampling or 'scanning' of self-generated visual constructs that are released from the constraints of visual input. If this view is correct, it renders REMs an ideal probe to study consciousness as "an exclusively internal affair" (Metzinger, 2009). In other words, REMs offer a probe of active inference - in the sense of predictive coding - when the brain is isolated from the sensorium in virtue of the natural blockade of sensory afferents during REM sleep. Crucially, REMs are temporally precise events that enable powerful inferences based on time series analyses. As a natural, task-free probe, (REMs) could be used in non-compliant subjects, including infants and animals. In short, REMs constitute a promising probe to study the ontogenetic and phylogenetic development of consciousness and perhaps the psychopathology of schizophrenia and autism, which have been considered in terms of aberrant predictive coding.
Volume-Based Analysis of 6-Month-Old Infant Brain MRI for Autism Biomarker Identification and Early Diagnosis.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is mainly diagnosed by the observation of core behavioral symptoms. Due to the absence of early biomarkers to detect infants either
Autistic-Like Traits in Pena-Shokeir Syndrome.Pena-Shokeir syndrome (PSS) is a rare, early lethal disease. PSS is characterized by fetal growth restriction, craniofacial deformities, multiple ankyloses and pulmonary hypoplasia. Because of the primary concern of physical health problems, psychiatric evaluation is frequently underestimated in PSS patients. Our case report describes a child with PSS who presented with autistic spectrum disorder symptoms.
Social Conformity in Autism.Humans are extremely susceptible to social influence. Here, we examine whether this susceptibility is altered in autism, a condition characterized by social difficulties. Autistic participants (N = 22) and neurotypical controls (N = 22) completed a memory test of previously seen words and were then exposed to answers supposedly given by four other individuals. Autistic individuals and controls were as likely to alter their judgements to align with inaccurate responses of group members. These changes reflected both temporary judgement changes (public conformity) and long-lasting memory changes (private conformity). Both groups were more susceptible to answers believed to be from other humans than from computer algorithms. Our results suggest that autistic individuals and controls are equally susceptible to social influence when reporting their memories.
Maternal immune activation, central nervous system development and behavioral phenotypes.Maternal immune activation (MIA) refers to a maternal immune system triggered by infectious or infectious-like stimuli. A cascade of cytokines and immunologic alterations are transmitted to the fetus, resulting in adverse phenotypes most notably in the central nervous system. Epidemiologic studies implicate maternal infections in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders, most commonly autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. In animal models, MIA causes neurochemical and anatomic changes in the brain that correspond to those found in humans with the disorders. As our understanding of the interactions between environment, genetics, and immune system grows, the role of alternative, noninfectious risk factors, such as prenatal stress, obesity, and the gut microbiome also becomes clearer. This review considers how infectious and noninfectious etiologies activate the maternal immune system. Their impact on fetal programming and neuropsychiatric disorders in offspring is examined in the context of human and animal studies.
Loss of the Chr16p11.2 ASD candidate gene Altered neuronal development is discussed as the underlying pathogenic mechanism of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Copy number variations of 16p11.2 have recurrently been identified in individuals with ASD. Of the 29 genes within this region,
Knowledge, Awareness, and Perceptions Regarding Autism Among Parents in Karachi, Pakistan.Background The prevalence of autism is growing worldwide. Owing to parents being the primary caregivers in most situations, their ability to recognize the signs and symptoms of autism and respond appropriately is of paramount importance in aiming to provide the best healthcare to autistic individuals. This study was conducted with the aim of ascertaining the parent's knowledge and awareness of autism. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among parents residing in Karachi, Pakistan. We excluded any individuals belonging to the medical profession, those who have autistic children, and those who couldn't completely comprehend English and Urdu. A sample size of 339 parents was selected. A validated and pre-tested questionnaire was administered among the study participants to record demographic information, knowledge, and perceptions regarding autism and its signs and symptoms. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version 23.0, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, US). A knowledge score was calculated for opinions about autism and its sign and symptoms individually to reflect a participant's overall knowledge regarding autism. Results From our study population, 75% of our population had heard of autism, with those who knew of someone with the disorder displaying greater awareness. However, our participants displayed poor knowledge scores, with a mean score of 5.59 in the section concerning correct opinions on autism and that of 6.84 in the section testing knowledge of signs and symptoms. Despite this, 95.6% of the participants were willing to get their children treated, in the event of them being diagnosed with autism. Conclusion Unfortunately, our population displayed a lack of awareness and knowledge regarding autism. To fill this gap, awareness programs should be conducted to promote parent's knowledge regarding autism, so as to allow for early diagnoses and an appropriate treatment plan/therapy. On a positive note, most were willing to get their children tested and treated in case of a diagnosis. However, only a small number of participants knew of autism centers in Karachi. General practitioners are needed to play a key role in counseling parents about autism.
Brief Report: Regional Variations in Characteristics of ASD Hospitalizations in the U.S.Regional differences in ASD inpatient care remain understudied. We used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample to examine contributory causes and potential determinants associated with regional variations in ASD hospitalizations. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses to identify differences in ASD hospitalizations across four U.S. Census Bureau-defined regions. Our results revealed considerable variations in ASD hospitalizations across U.S. regions. Compared with patients in the Northeast, those in the Midwest, South, and West were less likely to be hospitalized for ASD. Significant differences were observed among regions with regard to the effect of health insurance type, hospital length of stay, hospital bed size, hospital location and teaching status on ASD hospitalizations. The region-specific analysis provides direction for further investigation.
Ultrasonic vocalizations as a tool in studying emotional states in rodent models of social behavior and brain disease.Rodents emit ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) to communicate the presence of positive or negative emotional states and to coordinate social interactions. On this basis, USVs are increasingly being used as a behavioral readout in rodent studies of affect, motivation and social behavior. Notably, several investigations have demonstrated that rodents emit USVs when tested in experimental paradigms that are used in preclinical studies of psychiatric and neurological diseases. Moreover, it has been shown that calling behavior may be influenced by genetic and/or environmental factors (i.e., stress), early rearing conditions that have been implicated in brain disease, as well as psychoactive drugs. Hence, measuring USV emissions has emerged as a useful tool in studying the mechanisms that underlie the emotional disturbances featuring certain brain diseases, as well as in the development of suited pharmacological therapies. This review provides an overview of the behavioral significance of USV emissions and describes the contexts that promote calling behavior in rats and mice. Moreover, the review summarizes the current evidence concerning the use of USVs as a marker of affect in rat and mouse models of sociability, psychiatric diseases and neurological diseases, and discusses the strengths and current limitations of using USVs as a behavioral readout in rodent studies of emotional behavior.
Parents' future visions for their autistic transition-age youth: Hopes and expectations.Researchers have documented that young adults with autism spectrum disorder have poor outcomes in employment, post-secondary education, social participation, independent living, and community participation. There is a need to further explore contributing factors to such outcomes to better support successful transitions to adulthood. Parents play a critical role in transition planning, and parental expectations appear to impact young adult outcomes for autistic individuals. The aim of this study was to explore how parents express their future visions (i.e. hopes and expectations) for their autistic transition-age youth. Data were collected through focus groups and individual interviews with 18 parents. Parents' hopes and expectations focused on eight primary domains. In addition, parents often qualified or tempered their stated hope with expressions of fears, uncertainty, realistic expectations, and the perceived lack of guidance. We discuss our conceptualization of the relations among these themes and implications for service providers and research.
Amino Acid Dysregulation Metabotypes: Potential Biomarkers for Diagnosis and Individualized Treatment for Subtypes of Autism Spectrum Disorder.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is behaviorally and biologically heterogeneous and likely represents a series of conditions arising from different underlying genetic, metabolic, and environmental factors. There are currently no reliable diagnostic biomarkers for ASD. Based on evidence that dysregulation of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) may contribute to the behavioral characteristics of ASD, we tested whether dysregulation of amino acids (AAs) was a pervasive phenomenon in individuals with ASD. This is the first article to report results from the Children's Autism Metabolome Project (CAMP), a large-scale effort to define autism biomarkers based on metabolomic analyses of blood samples from young children.
A systematic review of comorbidity between cerebral palsy, autism spectrum disorders and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.The aim of this systematic review was to examine the incidence and prevalence of comorbidity between Cerebral Palsy (CP), Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).
Reliability and validity of the translated Chinese version of Autism Spectrum Rating Scale (2-5 years).Early autism screening is of great value, but there is lack of a screening tool of early age (2-5 years) in China. The Autism Spectrum Rating Scale (ASRS, 2-5 years) is a newly developed autism screening tool in the USA. This study aimed to evaluate the reliability and validity of the translated Chinese version of ASRS (C_ASRS) in Chinese children population before its application in China for early autism screening.
Overview of genetic models of autism spectrum disorders.Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of neurodevelopment disorders that are characterized by heterogenous cognitive deficits and genetic factors. As more ASD risk genes are identified, genetic animal models have been developed to parse out the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of ASD. In this review, we discuss a subset of genetic models of ASD, focusing on those that have been widely studied and strongly linked to ASD. We focus our discussion of these models in the context of the theories and potential mechanisms of ASD, including disruptions in cell growth and proliferation, spine dynamics, synaptic transmission, excitation/inhibition balance, intracellular signaling, neuroinflammation, and behavior. In addition to ASD pathophysiology, we examine the limitations and challenges that genetic models pose for the study of ASD biology. We end with a review of innovative techniques and concepts of ASD pathology that can be further applied to and studied using genetic ASD models.
From bedside to bench and back: Translating ASD models.Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) represent a heterogeneous group of disorders defined by deficits in social interaction/communication and restricted interests, behaviors, or activities. Models of ASD, developed based on clinical data and observations, are used in basic science, the "bench," to better understand the pathophysiology of ASD and provide therapeutic options for patients in the clinic, the "bedside." Translational medicine creates a bridge between the bench and bedside that allows for clinical and basic science discoveries to challenge one another to improve the opportunities to bring novel therapies to patients. From the clinical side, biomarker work is expanding our understanding of possible mechanisms of ASD through measures of behavior, genetics, imaging modalities, and serum markers. These biomarkers could help to subclassify patients with ASD in order to better target treatments to a more homogeneous groups of patients most likely to respond to a candidate therapy. In turn, basic science has been responding to developments in clinical evaluation by improving bench models to mechanistically and phenotypically recapitulate the ASD phenotypes observed in clinic. While genetic models are identifying novel therapeutics targets at the bench, the clinical efforts are making progress by defining better outcome measures that are most representative of meaningful patient responses. In this review, we discuss some of these challenges in translational research in ASD and strategies for the bench and bedside to bridge the gap to achieve better benefits to patients.
Early Diagnosis of Autism Disease by Multi-channel CNNs.Currently there are still no early biomarkers to detect infants with risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which is mainly diagnosed based on behavior observations at three or four years old. Since intervention efforts may miss a critical developmental window after 2 years old, it is significant to identify imaging-based biomarkers for early diagnosis of ASD. Although some methods using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for brain disease prediction have been proposed in the last decade, few of them were developed for predicting ASD in early age. Inspired by deep multi-instance learning, in this paper, we propose a patch-level data-expanding strategy for multi-channel convolutional neural networks to automatically identify infants with risk of ASD in early age. Experiments were conducted on the National Database for Autism Research (NDAR), with results showing that our proposed method can significantly improve the performance of early diagnosis of ASD.
The Relationship between Sleep and Cognitive Performance in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD): A Pilot Study.Sleep concerns are common in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The impact of poor sleep on cognitive performance in ASD children is not well-established. We investigated the possible correlation between sleep quality in ASD children and cognitive performance. The Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) was administered to examine specific components of non-verbal cognition.
Auditory Midbrain Hypoplasia and Dysmorphology after Prenatal Valproic Acid Exposure.Prenatal exposure to the antiepileptic valproic acid (VPA) is associated with an increased risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in humans and is used as an animal model of ASD. The majority of individuals with ASD exhibit adverse reactions to sensory stimuli and auditory dysfunction. Previous studies of animals exposed to VPA reveal abnormal neuronal responses to sound and mapping of sound frequency in the cerebral cortex and hyperactivation, hypoplasia and abnormal neuronal morphology in the cochlear nuclei (CN) and superior olivary complex (SOC). Herein, we examine the neuronal populations in the lateral lemniscus and inferior colliculus in animals exposed in utero to VPA. We used a combination of morphometric techniques, histochemistry and immunofluorescence to examine the nuclei of the lateral lemniscus (NLL) and the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (CNIC). We found that the VPA exposure resulted in larger neurons in the CNIC and the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (DNLL). However, we found that there were significantly fewer neurons throughout all nuclei examined in the auditory brainstem of VPA-exposed animals. Additionally, we found significantly fewer calbindin-immunopositive neurons in the DNLL. VPA exposure had no impact on the proportions of perineuronal nets in the NLL or CNIC. Finally, consistent with our observations in the CN and SOC, VPA exposure resulted in fewer dopaminergic terminals in the CNIC. Together, these results indicate that in utero VPA exposure significantly impacts structure and function of nearly the entire central auditory pathway.
Potentiation of Glutamatergic Synaptic Transmission Onto Dorsal Raphe Serotonergic Neurons in the Valproic Acid Model of Autism.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by social and communicative impairments and increased repetitive behaviors. These symptoms are often comorbid with increased anxiety. Prenatal exposure to valproic acid (VPA), an anti-seizure and mood stabilizer medication, is a major environmental risk factor of ASD. Given the important role of the serotonergic (5-HT) system in anxiety, we examined the impact of prenatal VPA exposure on the function of dorsal raphe nucleus (DRn) 5-HT neurons. We found that male rats prenatally exposed to VPA exhibited increased anxiety-like behaviors revealed by a decreased time spent on the open arms of the elevated plus maze. Prenatal VPA exposed rats also exhibited a stereotypic behavior as indicated by excessive self-grooming in a novel environment. These behavioral phenotypes were associated with increased electrical activity of putative DRn 5-HT neurons recorded
Teaching a perspective-taking component skill to children with autism in the natural environment.We evaluated procedures for teaching three children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder the perspective-taking component skill of tacting what others are sensing across all five senses: see, taste, feel, hear, and smell. Using a multiple baseline across participants design, we evaluated a training package consisting of multiple exemplar training, reinforcement, and error correction. The treatment package was implemented in the natural environment and was effective for teaching participants to tact what others sensed. Generalization across untrained stimuli and people was observed from baseline to posttraining for all participants. We discuss how this component skill may be related to teaching further skills related to perspective taking such as tacting what others know, predicting future behavior based upon one's beliefs, and creating false beliefs in others for the purpose of adaptive deceptive behaviors such as keeping secrets, surprises, and bluffing during games.
Maternal depression and antidepressant use during pregnancy and the risk of autism spectrum disorder in offspring.Results of some studies suggest that prenatal antidepressant exposure increases the risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in offspring, while other studies suggest that depression independently increases the risk of having a child with ASD. Thus, confounding by indication is a concern.
Inpatient Psychiatric Treatment of Serious Behavioral Problems in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD): Specialized Versus General Inpatient Units.Psychiatric hospitalization of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is common, but there is little comparative information available on different psychiatric hospital treatment models. Children with ASD ages 4-20 were enrolled upon admission to either a specialized (N = 53) or a general child psychiatric unit (N = 27). Caregivers completed the Aberrant Behavioral Checklist-Irritability Sub-scale (ABC-I) at admission, discharge, and 2 months post-discharge and reported information on crisis service utilization 2 months post-discharge. Children treated in the specialized unit had lower ABC-I scores at discharge and 2 months post-discharge (F = 8.98, p = 0.003) and were significantly less likely to experience an ER visit within 2 months post-discharge (X
Early Correction of N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor Function Improves Autistic-like Social Behaviors in Adult Shank2Autism spectrum disorder involves neurodevelopmental dysregulations that lead to visible symptoms at early stages of life. Many autism spectrum disorder-related mechanisms suggested by animal studies are supported by demonstrated improvement in autistic-like phenotypes in adult animals following experimental reversal of dysregulated mechanisms. However, whether such mechanisms also act at earlier stages to cause autistic-like phenotypes is unclear.
Relative preferences for edible and leisure stimuli in children with autism.Prior researchers have reported a tendency for individuals with developmental disabilities to select edible items more often than leisure items when those items are presented together in stimulus preference assessments. However, children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), with whom many behavior analysts currently practice, are underrepresented in this body of literature. We conducted a replication of prior research with 26 children with ASD. Results indicated that edible items were more likely than leisure items to rank highly in our preference assessments, in concurrence with prior research. However, leisure items were also selected more often overall than in prior research, and significant individual variation was observed. These results suggest that preference assessments containing both edible and leisure stimuli can yield useful information for behavior analysts providing services to children with ASD, and the degree of preference for edible items noted in prior work may not be reflected in this contemporary population.
REDUCED CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN MENTALIZING AND MIRROR SYSTEMS IN AUTISM SPECTRUM CONDITION.The mentalizing system and mirror system are thought to play important roles in inferring the internal mental states of others - a process known as mentalizing. Autism spectrum condition (ASC) is associated with difficulties in mentalizing. The aim of this study was to determine whether the behavioural difficulties in mentalizing associated with ASC can be explained by changes in functional connectivity between the mentalizing and mirror system. We recruited 40 adult participants (20 with ASC and 20 typically-developing). Brain activity was monitored using functional magnetic resonance imaging while participants watched videos in which actors performed hand actions. The videos were shown in separate mentalizing and non-mentalizing blocks. During mentalizing blocks, participants were asked to indicate whether hand actions were clumsy or spiteful (i.e. to judge the intent of the action). During non-mentalizing blocks, participants indicated whether the actions were successful or unsuccessful (i.e. to judge the outcome of the action). Higher activity during the mentalizing blocks compared to non-mentalizing blocks was found in regions associated with the mentalizing system: the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), as well as in regions typically associated with the mirror system: the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the inferior parietal lobe (IPL). Next, functional connectivity between regions was evaluated as a function of task. During mentalizing blocks, there was increased functional connectivity between the dmPFC and the mirror system in typically developing participants. In contrast, there was no increase in functional connectivity between these regions in ASC participants. Connectivity between the dmPFC and IFG was negatively correlated with autistic traits. The reduced connectivity in ASC participants was consistent with behavioural performance on the mentalizing task, which was also negatively correlated with the level of autistic traits. Together, these data emphasise the importance of functional connectivity between the mentalizing and mirror systems when inferring social intentions and show that reduced connectivity between these systems may explain some of the behavioural difficulties experienced by adults with ASC.
Foot massage evokes oxytocin release and activation of orbitofrontal cortex and superior temporal sulcus.Massage may be an important method for increasing endogenous oxytocin concentrations and of potential therapeutic benefit in disorders with social dysfunction such as autism where basal oxytocin levels are typically reduced. Here we investigated oxytocin release and associated neural responses using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during hand- or machine-administered massage. 40 adult male subjects received 10 min of light foot massage either by hand or machine in a counterbalanced order and then rated pleasure, intensity, arousal and how much they would pay for the massage. Blood samples were taken before and after each massage condition to determine plasma oxytocin concentrations. Neural responses from medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortex, superior temporal sulcus and somatosensory cortex were measured (fNIRS oxy-Hb) together with skin conductance responses (SCR), ratings of the massage experience, autistic traits and sensitivity to social touch. Results showed subjects gave higher ratings of pleasure, but not intensity or arousal, after hand- compared with machine-administered massage and there were no differential effects on SCR. Subjects were also willing to pay more for the hand massage. Plasma oxytocin increased after both massage by hand or machine, but more potently after massage by hand. Both basal oxytocin concentrations and increases evoked by hand-, but not machine-administered massage, were negatively associated with trait autism and attitudes towards social touch, but massage by hand-evoked changes were significant in higher as well as lower trait individuals. Increased neural responses to hand vs. machine-administered massage were found in posterior superior temporal sulcus and medial/lateral orbitofrontal cortex but not somatosensory cortex. Orbitofrontal cortex and superior temporal cortex activation during hand massage was associated with the amount of money subjects were willing to pay and between orbitofrontal cortex activation and autism scores. Thus, hand-administered massage can potently increase oxytocin release and activity in brain regions involved in social cognition and reward but not sensory aspects of affective touch. Massage by hand induced changes in both oxytocin concentrations and neural circuits involved in processing social affective trust may have therapeutic potential in the context of autism.
Using Pupillometry to Assess the Atypical Pupillary Light Reflex and LC-NE System in ASD.With recent advances in technology, there has been growing interest in use of eye-tracking and pupillometry to assess the visual pathway in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Within emerging literature, an atypical pupillary light reflex (PLR) has been documented, holding potential for use as a clinical screening biomarker for ASD. This review outlines dominant theories of neuropathology associated with ASD and integrates underlying neuroscience associated with the atypical PLR through a reciprocal model of brainstem involvement and cortical underconnectivity. This review draws from animal models of ASD demonstrating disruption of cranial motor nuclei and brain imaging studies examining arousal and the influence of the locus coeruleus norepinephrine (LC-NE) system on the pupillary response. Pupillometry methods are explained in relation to existing data examining the PLR in ASD and pupillary parameters of constriction latency and tonic pupil diameter as key parameters for investigation. This focused review provides preliminary data toward future work developing pupillometry metrics and offers direction for studies aimed at rigorous study replication using pupillometry with the ASD population. Experimental conditions and testing protocol for capturing pupil parameters with this clinical population are discussed to promote clinical research and translational application.
[Identifying and treating autism spectrum disorders in perinatal care].Severe forms of autism may be spotted by families in the first year of life, but are still rarely treated before the age of 3. Screening and early treatment are recommended to improve the children's functional prognosis. However, there is still little knowledge among perinatal and early childhood professionals of the symptomatology of autistic disorders. Several points are sensitive: during the first year the symptoms of children at risk are non-specific apart from a lack of desire to form relationships; and the early treatment probably modifies the clinical picture of young patients. Screening tools are rare but are starting to be developed.
Validation of a Salivary RNA Test for Childhood Autism Spectrum Disorder. The diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) relies on behavioral assessment. Efforts to define biomarkers of ASD have not resulted in an objective, reliable test. Studies of RNA levels in ASD have demonstrated potential utility, but have been limited by a focus on single RNA types, small sample sizes, and lack of developmental delay controls. We hypothesized that a saliva-based poly-"omic" RNA panel could objectively distinguish children with ASD from their neurotypical peers and children with non-ASD developmental delay.
Social difficulties in youth with autism with and without anxiety and ADHD symptoms.Social difficulties inherent to autism spectrum disorder are often linked with co-occurring symptoms of anxiety and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The present study sought to examine the relation between such co-occurring symptoms and social challenges. Parents of adolescents with autism (N = 113) reported upon social challenges via the social responsiveness scale (SRS) and anxiety and ADHD symptomatology via the Child Behavior Checklist. Results revealed differences in SRS scores across co-occurring symptom subgroups (Anxiety, ADHD, Both, Neither)-namely, adolescents with autism and anxiety as well as those with autism, anxiety, and ADHD showed greater scores on the SRS than the other groups. Implications for research and clinical practice are discussed and recommendations are offered. Autism Research 2018, 11: 1679-1689. © 2018 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: Anxiety and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms are related to greater social challenges for adolescents with autism spectrum disorder. The present study found that autism with anxiety and autism with anxiety and ADHD, was related to greater social difficulties than autism alone. Findings provide further support for the intertwined nature of anxiety and ADHD symptoms in autism. What this may mean for research and clinical practice is considered and recommendations are suggested.
Behavioral inhibition and activation as a modifier process in autism spectrum disorder: Examination of self-reported BIS/BAS and alpha EEG asymmetry.The Modifier Model of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) suggests that phenotypic variability within ASD is rooted in modifier processes, such as the behavioral inhibition system (BIS) and behavioral activation system (BAS). Among a sample of 53 adolescents with ASD, this study examined associations between (a) self-reported BIS/BAS and frontal and parietal alpha electroencephalogram asymmetry and whether these indices related to (b) ASD severity (via the Autism Quotient), and/or (c) co-occurring anxiety and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (via Youth Self Report and Child Behavior Checklist). Findings showed that alpha asymmetry was associated with self-reported BAS scores, such that greater BAS was related to greater right-frontal hemisphere activation and relatively greater left-parietal hemisphere activation. Additionally, associations emerged between ASD severity and self-reported BAS and alpha asymmetry, and between anxiety symptoms and self-reported BIS and alpha asymmetry. Furthermore, mediation analyses revealed that BAS mediated the association between asymmetry and autism severity. Therefore, alpha asymmetry and BIS/BAS activity may provide insight into how ASD presents in adolescence as well as who might be at greater risk for developing co-occurring psychopathologies. This study highlights the importance of considering motivational systems to elucidate individual differences among youth with ASD and working toward the longer term goal of better understanding differential responses to treatment. Autism Research 2018, 11: 1653-1666. © 2018 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: Differences in the likelihood to avoid (behavioral inhibition system; BIS) or approach (behavioral activation system; BAS) situations are thought to relate to patterns of brain activity (via electroencephalogram asymmetry asymmetry). This study revealed that these tendencies may influence the presentation of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and symptoms of anxiety in adolescents with ASD.
Endocrine Disruptors and Autism Spectrum Disorder in Pregnancy: A Review and Evaluation of the Quality of the Epidemiological Evidence.Exposure to environmental contaminants during pregnancy has been linked to adverse health outcomes later in life. Notable among these pollutants are the endocrine disruptors chemicals (EDCs), which are ubiquitously present in the environment and they have been measured and quantified in the fetus. In this systematic review, our objective was to summarize the epidemiological research on the potential association between prenatal exposure to EDCs and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) published from 2005 to 2016. The Navigation Guide Systematic Review Methodology was applied. A total of 17 studies met the inclusion criteria for this review, including: five cohorts and 12 case-control. According to the definitions specified in the Navigation Guide, we rated the quality of evidence for a relationship between prenatal exposure to EDCs and ASD as "moderate". Although the studies generally showed a positive association between EDCs and ASD, after considering the strengths and limitations, we concluded that the overall strength of evidence supporting an association between prenatal exposure to EDCs and later ASD in humans remains "limited" and inconclusive. Further well-conducted prospective studies are warranted to clarify the role of EDCs on ASD development.
Immune Dysfunction and Autoimmunity as Pathological Mechanisms in Autism Spectrum Disorders.Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of heterogeneous neurological disorders that are highly variable and are clinically characterized by deficits in social interactions, communication, and stereotypical behaviors. Prevalence has risen from 1 in 10,000 in 1972 to 1 in 59 children in the United States in 2014. This rise in prevalence could be due in part to better diagnoses and awareness, however, these together cannot solely account for such a significant rise. While causative connections have not been proven in the majority of cases, many current studies focus on the combined effects of genetics and environment. Strikingly, a distinct picture of immune dysfunction has emerged and been supported by many independent studies over the past decade. Many players in the immune-ASD puzzle may be mechanistically contributing to pathogenesis of these disorders, including skewed cytokine responses, differences in total numbers and frequencies of immune cells and their subsets, neuroinflammation, and adaptive and innate immune dysfunction, as well as altered levels of immunoglobulin and the presence of autoantibodies which have been found in a substantial number of individuals with ASD. This review summarizes the latest research linking ASD, autoimmunity and immune dysfunction, and discusses evidence of a potential autoimmune component of ASD.
[Epidemiological aspects of autism in mental health care structures in the district of Bamako, Mali].Autism is a global and early developmental disorder that appears before the age 3 years old. It is characterized by a triad of symptoms affecting the following domains: social interaction, verbal and non-verbal communication, imagination and behaviors. This work aimed to determine the frequency of autism and to identify its risk factors in Malians aged 0-17 years old.
Predictors of Pragmatic Communication in School-Age Siblings of Children with ASD and Low-Risk Controls.Little empirical evidence exists about school-age pragmatic communication or predictors in siblings at heightened familial risk for ASD (HR) and low-risk (LR) controls. The Pragmatic Rating Scale-School-Age (Landa unpublished) was scored for 49 HR siblings and 18 LR controls at 8-12 years. Social-communication and language measures were collected between 14 and 36 months. At 36-months, siblings were classified as ASD (HR-ASD, n = 15), broad autism phenotype (HR-BAP, n = 19), or typically developing (HR-TD, n = 15). Results revealed a pragmatic continuum with significantly better scores for HR-TD than HR-BAP or HR-ASD, and HR-BAP than HR-ASD. Per regression models including all participants, 14-month joint attention initiations predicted school-age pragmatic communication, as did 24-month social-communication and expressive language scores. Early joint attention, social-communication, and language abilities contribute to later pragmatic functioning.
The prevalence and general health status of people with intellectual disabilities and autism co-occurring together: a total population study.Little is known about the population prevalence of co-occurring intellectual disabilities and autism, and its impact on general health status. The study aimed to investigate this, in comparison with the general population.
Comparison of task interspersal ratios on efficiency of learning and problem behavior for children with autism spectrum disorder.The current study extends the literature on task interspersal (TI) by comparing the effects of four different TI ratios on the efficiency of skill acquisition and on levels of problem behavior in children with autism spectrum disorder and related disorders. The four ratios of TI were 3:1, 1:1, 1:3, and 0:1 mastered-to-acquisition tasks. An adapted alternating treatments design was implemented to compare the cumulative number of stimuli mastered, mean training time to mastery, rate of acquisition, and the level of problem behavior. The results showed that the 0:1 condition was the most efficient intervention procedure for all four participants. In addition, TI did not lead to a greater reduction in levels of problem behavior.
Larval zebrafish model for studying the effects of valproic acid on neurodevelopment: An approach towards modeling autism.Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder of early onset, characterized by impaired sociability, cognitive function and stereotypies. The etiology of ASD involves a multidimensional link between genetic, neurobiological and environmental factors. Since existing, comprehensive animal models for ASD are time consuming and laborious, the need for simple, quick approaches to study subsets of ASD-associated characteristics has always been in demand for better understanding of disease. The aim of the present study was to develop a cost and time effective zebrafish model with quantifiable parameters to facilitate mechanistic studies as well as high-throughput screening of new molecules for autism.
Autistic Man Falling Through The Cracks. Advanced patient transport and the "pop-up" recovery ward.The Royal Flying Doctor Service was tasked to relocate a 19 year-old autistic patient with severe social anxiety, agoraphobia and morbid obesity from one residential location to another. The retrieval team was confronted with two main challenges: 1. Continuous risk elevation in an elective patient transportation as distinct from other urgent prehospital transfers of mental health patients. 2. Pre-hospital ketamine/propofol sedation of an aggressive/combative patient with recovery from sedation in a private property. The transfer accomplished the successful relocation of the patient.
Bumetanide for Autism Spectrum Disorder in Children: A Review of Randomized Controlled Trials.To evaluate clinical trials using bumetanide in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) treatment.
EEG entropy analysis in autistic children.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex and heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder, which is characterized by impairments of social interaction and communication, and by stereotyped and repetitive behaviors. Extensive evidences demonstrated that the core neurobiological mechanism of autism spectrum disorder is aberrant neural connectivity, so the entropy of EEG can be applied to quantify this aberrant neural connectivity. In this study, we investigated four entropy methods to analyse the resting-state EEG of the autistic children and the typical development (TD) children. Through 43 children diagnosed with autism aged from 4 to 8 years old as compared to 43 normal children matched for age and gender, we found region-specifically and entropy-specifically which were more sensitive with the increase of age. In detail, for 4 years old group, there is significant difference in central by Renyi permutation entropy method; the significant differences are in frontal and central by sample entropy for 5 years old group; the significant difference is in frontal by fuzzy entropy for 6 years old group; the significant difference is in central by Renyi wavelet entropy for 7 years old group and the difference is in occipital by Renyi wavelet entropy for 8 years old group. The results might guide us to make an accurate distinction between ASD and TD children.
Exposure to nature for children with autism spectrum disorder: Benefits, caveats, and barriers.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is the fastest growing developmental disorder in countries across the world. Although recent studies have demonstrated the health benefits of nature for typically developing children and children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, it is unclear whether these benefits extend to children with ASD. In this study, we investigated whether benefits associated with exposure to nature could be observed by parents of children diagnosed with ASD. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 22 parents and caregivers of children on the spectrum from two cities in China. Results showed that exposure to nature provided motor-sensory, emotional and social benefits to children with ASD, although some of the identified benefits also come with concerns. Participants identified a wide range of barriers that make exposing their children to nature difficult. Among them, inappropriate behaviors, safety concerns, phobias and issues with the public realm emerged as critical hurdles. These findings suggest that practitioners should consider nature exposure as an intervention strategy, and planners and designers should create places that better accommodate the needs of children with ASD.
EEG for Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder.Investigators from Boston University and the University of San Francisco studied whether EEG could be reliably used as an early biomarker for diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
Comparison of Online and Face-to-Face Parent Education for Children with Autism and Sleep Problems.Many children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have sleep disorders. Face-to-face (F2F) sessions have empowered parents to help their child sleep. Our goal was whether online technologies could provide similar improvements in children's sleep while also improving parents' quality of life. Identical programs were taught in two sessions to F2F and online parents. Measurements were compared from baseline to 4 and 8 weeks post teaching sessions. Twenty-three participants completed the program. Parent quality of life improved for both groups. Parent fatigue scores were improved and sustained for the online group. The total sleep score improved for both groups, while the online group had sustained decreases in night wakings. Online methods can conveniently help improve sleep for children with ASD.
Treatment of catatonia in autism spectrum disorders.To review the treatment courses of 22 autistic patients diagnosed with catatonia over a 12-year period, including treatment with benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy.
Patient-level medication regimen complexity in an adolescent and adult population with autism spectrum disorders.Adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) frequently experience polypharmacy. However, there is limited understanding of how to quantify medication complexity in this vulnerable population.
Decreased Cortical Thickness in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex in Adults with Autism.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder underdiagnosed in adults. To date, no consistent evidence of alterations in brain structure has been reported in adults with ASD and few studies were conducted at that age. We analyzed structural magnetic resonance imaging data from 167 high functioning adults with ASD and 195 controls. We ran our analyses on a discovery (n = 301) and a replication sample (n = 61). The right caudal anterior cingulate cortical thickness was significantly thinner in adults with ASD compared to controls in both the discovery and the replication sample. Our work underlines the relevance of studying the brain anatomy of an adult ASD population.
Differences in means-end exploration between infants at risk for autism and typically developing infants in the first 15 months of life.Our study compared means-end exploration in infants at risk (AR) for autism and typically developing (TD) infants using a nested box paradigm. Sixteen AR and 16 TD infants were observed at 9, 12, and 15 months with follow-up at 18 and 24 months. We collected video data on three tasks involving retrieval of a small toy by opening (a) an opaque box, (b) a transparent box, and (c) two nested boxes. Dependent variables included hand bias, time to completion, bilateral hand use, problem-solving strategies used, and tester assistance required. There were no group differences in terms of hand biases. Compared to TD infants, AR infants had lower bilateral hand use, poor problem solving skills, and required greater assistance. Both groups demonstrated age-related improvements in motor and cognitive skills. Means-end exploration provides a window into the bilateral coordination and motor planning/problem-solving abilities of young infants at risk for autism. Lastly, object retrieval tasks could serve as important learning contexts for at-risk infants.
Neuroimmune and Inflammatory Signals in Complex Disorders of the Central Nervous System.An extensive microglial-astrocyte-monocyte-neuronal cross talk seems to be crucial for normal brain function, development, and recovery. However, under certain conditions neuroinflammatory interactions between brain cells and neuroimmune cells influence disease outcome and brain pathology. Microglial cells express a range of functional states with dynamically pleomorphic profiles from a surveilling status of synaptic transmission to an active player in major events of development such as synaptic elimination, regeneration, and repair. Also, inflammation mediates a series of neurotoxic roles in neuropsychiatric conditions and neurodegenerative diseases. The present review discusses data on the involvement of neuroinflammatory conditions that alter neuroimmune interactions in four different pathologies. In the first section of this review, we discuss the ability of the early developing brain to respond to a focal lesion with a rapid compensatory plasticity of intact axons and the role of microglial activation and proinflammatory cytokines in brain repair. In the second section, we present data of neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative disorders and discuss the role of reactive astrocytes in motor neuron toxicity and the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In the third section, we discuss major depressive disorders as the consequence of dysfunctional interactions between neural and immune signals that result in increased peripheral immune responses and increase proinflammatory cytokines. In the last section, we discuss autism spectrum disorders and altered brain circuitries that emerge from abnormal long-term responses of innate inflammatory cytokines and microglial phenotypic dysfunctions.
The Relationship of Clinical Symptoms with Social Cognition in Children Diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Specific Learning Disorder or Autism Spectrum Disorder.One of the areas of social cognition is Theory of Mind (ToM) is defined as the capacity to interpret, infer and explain mental states underlying the behavior of others. When social cognition studies on neurodevelopmental disorders are examined, it can be seen that this skill has not been studied sufficiently in children with Specific Learning Disorder (SLD).
Solving for X: Evidence for sex-specific autism biomarkers across multiple transcriptomic studies.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a markedly heterogeneous condition with a varied phenotypic presentation. Its high concordance among siblings, as well as its clear association with specific genetic disorders, both point to a strong genetic etiology. However, the molecular basis of ASD is still poorly understood, although recent studies point to the existence of sex-specific ASD pathophysiologies and biomarkers. Despite this, little is known about how exactly sex influences the gene expression signatures of ASD probands. In an effort to identify sex-dependent biomarkers and characterize their function, we present an analysis of a single paired-end postmortem brain RNA-Seq data set and a meta-analysis of six blood-based microarray data sets. Here, we identify several genes with sex-dependent dysregulation, and many more with sex-independent dysregulation. Moreover, through pathway analysis, we find that these sex-independent biomarkers have substantially different biological roles than the sex-dependent biomarkers, and that some of these pathways are ubiquitously dysregulated in both postmortem brain and blood. We conclude by synthesizing the discovered biomarker profiles with the extant literature, by highlighting the advantage of studying sex-specific dysregulation directly, and by making a call for new transcriptomic data that comprise large female cohorts.
Mechanisms Underlying Microbial-Mediated Changes in Social Behavior in Mouse Models of Autism Spectrum Disorder.Currently, there are no medications that effectively treat the core symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We recently found that the bacterial species Lactobacillus (L.) reuteri reverses social deficits in maternal high-fat-diet offspring. However, whether the effect of L. reuteri on social behavior is generalizable to other ASD models and its mechanism(s) of action remains unknown. Here, we found that treatment with L. reuteri selectively rescues social deficits in genetic, environmental, and idiopathic ASD models. Interestingly, the effects of L. reuteri on social behavior are not mediated by restoring the composition of the host's gut microbiome, which is altered in all of these ASD models. Instead, L. reuteri acts in a vagus nerve-dependent manner and rescues social interaction-induced synaptic plasticity in the ventral tegmental area of ASD mice, but not in oxytocin receptor-deficient mice. Collectively, treatment with L. reuteri emerges as promising non-invasive microbial-based avenue to combat ASD-related social dysfunction.
Reduced neural sensitivity to rapid individual face discrimination in autism spectrum disorder.Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are characterized by impairments in social communication and interaction. Although difficulties at processing social signals from the face in ASD have been observed and emphasized for many years, there is a lot of inconsistency across both behavioral and neural studies.
Molecular Pathology and Pharmacological Treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorder-Like Phenotypes Using Rodent Models.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder with a high prevalence rate. The core symptoms of ASD patients are impaired social communication and repetitive behavior. Genetic and environmental factors contribute to pathophysiology of ASD. Regarding environmental risk factors, it is known that valproic acid (VPA) exposure during pregnancy increases the chance of ASD among offspring. Over a decade of animal model studies have shown that maternal treatment with VPA in rodents recapitulates ASD-like pathophysiology at a molecular, cellular and behavioral level. Here, we review the prevailing theories of ASD pathogenesis, including excitatory/inhibitory imbalance, neurotransmitter dysfunction, dysfunction of mTOR and endocannabinoid signaling pathways, neuroinflammation and epigenetic alterations that have been associated with ASD. We also describe the evidence linking neuropathological changes to ASD-like behavioral abnormalities in maternal VPA-treated rodents. In addition to obtaining an understanding of the neuropathological mechanisms, the VPA-induced ASD-like animal models also serve as a good platform for testing pharmacological reagents that might be use treating ASD. We therefore have summarized the various pharmacological studies that have targeted the classical neurotransmitter systems, the endocannabinoids, the Wnt signal pathway and neuroinflammation. These approaches have been shown to often be able to ameliorate the ASD-like phenotypes induced by maternal VPA treatments.
Differential T Cell Levels of Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-II in Children With Autism.Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by impairments in verbal and non-verbal communication, in social interactions, and often accompanied by stereotypical interests and behaviors. A role for immune dysfunction has long been implicated in ASD pathophysiology, behavioral severity, and co-morbidities. The pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) has been associated with ASD in some studies but little is known about its receptors. There are two receptors for TNFα, with TNFRI relaying many of the signals from TNFα, especially those that are rapid, whilst TNFRII relays later more long-term effects of TNFα. Proteolytic cleavage can lead to the soluble versions of these receptors which can neutralize the effects of TNFα. Here, we determined levels of TNFα and its receptors in 36 children with a confirmed diagnosis of ASD and 27 confirmed typically developing (TD) controls, 2-5 years-of-age. Children with ASD had higher levels of TNFRII on T cells compared to controls following cell stimulation. Levels of sTNFRII were decreased in cell supernatants following stimulation in ASD. Overall these data corroborate the role of inflammatory events in ASD and align with previous studies that have shown differential changes in cellular adaptive immunity in children with ASD. Future longitudinal analyzes of cellular immune function and downstream signaling from immune receptors will help further delineate the role of inflammation in ASD.
Effects of modeling rote versus varied responses on response variability and skill acquisition during discrete-trial instruction.Despite its advantages, discrete-trial instruction (DTI) has been criticized for producing rote responding. Although there is little research supporting this claim, if true, this may be problematic given the propensity of children with autism to engage in restricted and repetitive behavior. One feature that is common in DTI that may contribute to rote responding is the prompting and reinforcement of one correct response per discriminative stimulus. To evaluate the potential negative effects of rote prompts on varied responding, we compared the effects of modeling rote versus varied target responses during the teaching of intraverbal categorization. We also evaluated the effects of these procedures on the efficiency of acquisition of any one correct response. For all four children, any increase in varied responding was fleeting, and for two participants, acquisition was slower in the variable-modeling condition.
