Reading speed and phonological awareness deficits among Arabic-speaking children with dyslexia.Although reading accuracy of isolated words and phonological awareness represent the main criteria of subtyping developmental dyslexia, there is increasing evidence that reduced reading speed also represents a defining characteristic. In the present study, reading speed and accuracy were measured in Arabic-speaking phonological and mixed dyslexic children matched with controls of the same age. Participants in third and fourth grades, aged from 9-10 to 9-8 years, were given single frequent and infrequent word and pseudo-word reading and phonological awareness tasks. Results showed that the group with dyslexia scored significantly lower than controls in accuracy and speed in reading tasks. Phonological and mixed dyslexic subgroups differed in infrequent and frequent word reading accuracy, the latter being worse. In contrast, the subgroups were comparable in pseudo-word identification and phonological awareness. Delayed phonological and recognition processes of infrequent and frequent words, respectively, were placed in the context of the dual route model of reading and the specific orthographic features of the Arabic language.
Rapid Automatized Naming in Children with Dyslexia_HP: Is Inhibitory Control Involved?Rapid automatized naming (RAN) is widely seen as an important indicator of Dyslexia_HP. The nature of the cognitive processes involved in rapid naming is however still a topic of controversy. We hypothesized that in addition to the involvement of phonological processes and processing speed, RAN is a function of inhibition processes, in particular of interference control. A total 86 children with Dyslexia_HP and 31 normal readers were recruited. Our results revealed that in addition to phonological processing and processing speed, interference control predicts rapid naming in Dyslexia_HP, but in contrast to these other two cognitive processes, inhibition is not significantly associated with their reading and spelling skills. After variance in reading and spelling associated with processing speed, interference control and phonological processing was partialled out, naming speed was no longer consistently associated with the reading and spelling skills of children with Dyslexia_HP. Finally, dyslexic children differed from normal readers on naming speed, literacy skills, phonological processing and processing speed, but not on inhibition processes. Both theoretical and clinical interpretations of these results are discussed.

Developmental Dyslexia_HP and phonological processing in European Portuguese orthography.This study analysed the performance of phonological processing, the diagnostic accuracy and the influence on reading in children who were native speakers of an orthography of intermediate depth. Portuguese children with developmental Dyslexia_HP (DD; N=24; aged 10-12 years), chronological age (CA)-matched controls (N=24; aged 10-12 years) and reading level (RL)-matched controls (N=24; aged 7-9 years) were tested on measures of phonological processing (phonological awareness, naming speed and verbal short-term memory) and reading. The results indicated that the children with DD performed significantly poorer in all measures compared with the CA and RL. Phonological awareness and naming speed showed a high accuracy (receiver operating characteristics curve analysis) for discriminating the children with DD from the CA and RL, whereas the presence of abnormally low scores in phonological awareness and naming speed was more Frequent_HP in the DD group than in the controls and the normative population. Hierarchical linear regression analyses revealed that phonological awareness was the most important predictor of all reading accuracy measures, whereas naming speed was particularly related to text reading fluency.

Diverse inhibition and Working_Memory_ASDPTO of word recognition for dyslexic and typically developing children.The present study focuses on (1) comparing dyslexic and typically developing children's cognitive and behavioural inhibitory abilities; (2) examining the relationship between word recognition, inhibition, and Working_Memory_ASDPTO in dyslexic and typically developing children by correlation, regression and path analyses. Participants in the present study were sampled from 3rd and 4th graders in Taiwan. Results indicated that dyslexic and typically developing children did not significantly differ in behavioural inhibition. In contrast, dyslexic children showed significantly lower levels of cognitive inhibition compared to typically developing children. Dyslexic children also showed that only cognitive inhibition significantly contributed to their word recognition, and typically developing children showed similar phenomenon. Finally, models of dyslexic and typically developing children's Working_Memory_ASDPTO, inhibition and word recognition were similar in that Working_Memory_ASDPTO and cognitive inhibition significantly contributed to word recognition for both dyslexic and typically developing children. Moreover, the contribution of the combination of Working_Memory_ASDPTO and inhibition was greater than the contribution of only inhibition; both of typically developing and dyslexic children's Working_Memory_ASDPTO showed more contributions than inhibition.

The influence of oculomotor tasks on postural control in dyslexic children.Dual task is known to Affect_ASDPTO postural stability in children. We explored the effect of visual tasks on postural control in thirty dyslexic children. A selected group of thirty chronological age-matched non-dyslexic children (mean age: 9.92 ± 0.35 years) and a group of thirty reading age-matched non-dyslexic children (mean reading age: 7.90 ± 0.25 years) were chosen for comparison. All children underwent ophthalmologic and optometric evaluation. Eye movements were recorded by a video-oculography system (EyeBrain® T2) and postural sway was recorded simultaneously by a force platform (TechnoConept®). All children performed fixations, pursuits, pro- and anti-saccades tasks. Dyslexic children showed significantly poor near fusional vergence ranges (convergence and divergence) with respect to the non-dyslexic children groups. During the postural task, quality of fixation and anti-saccade performance in dyslexic children were significantly worse compared to the two non-dyslexic children groups. In contrast, the number of catch-up saccades during pursuits and the latency of pro- and anti-saccades were similar in the three groups of children examined. Concerning postural quality, dyslexic children were more unstable than chronological age-matched non-dyslexic children group. For all three groups of children tested we also observed that executing saccades (pro- and anti-saccades) reduced postural values significantly in comparison with fixation and pursuit tasks. The impairment in convergence and divergence fusional capabilities could be due to an immaturity in cortical structures controlling the vergence system. The poor oculomotor performance reported in dyslexic children suggested a deficit in allocating visual attention and their Postural_instability_HP observed is in line with the cerebellar impairment previously reported in dyslexic children. Finally, pro- or anti-saccades reduce postural values compared to fixation and pursuit tasks in all groups of children tested, suggesting a different influence of visual tasks on postural control according to their attentional demand.

Influence of context-sensitive rules on the formation of orthographic representations in Spanish dyslexic children.Spanish-speaking developmental dyslexics are mainly characterized by poor reading fluency. One reason for this lack of fluency could be a difficulty in creating and accessing lexical representations, because, as the self-teaching theory suggest, it is necessary to develop orthographic representations to use direct reading (Share, 1995). It is possible that this difficulty to acquire orthographic representations can be specifically related to words that contain context-sensitive graphemes, since it has been demonstrated that reading is Affected_HP by this kind of graphemes (Barca et al., 2007). In order to test this possibility we compared a group of dyslexic children with a group of normal readers (9-13 years), in a task of repeated reading. Pseudo-words (half short and half long) with simple and contextual dependent rules were used. The length effect reduction on the reading speed, after repeated exposure, was considered an indicator of orthographic representation development, as the length effect is strong when reading unknown words, but absent when reading familiar words. The results show that dyslexic children have difficulties in developing orthographic representations, not only with context-sensitive graphemes, but also with simple graphemes. In contrast to the control children, in the dyslexic group differences between reading times for short and long stimuli remained without significant changes after six presentations. Besides, this happened with sensitive context rules and also with simple grapheme-phoneme conversion rules. On the other hand, response and articulation times were greatly Affected_HP by length in dyslexic children, indicating the use of serial reading. Results suggest that the problems related to storing orthographic representations could be caused by a learning deficit, independently of whether the word contained context-sensitive rules or not.

[Relationship between magnocellular function and reading skills in children: a study using visual evoked potentials].Developmental Dyslexia_HP (DD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by difficulties with accurate and/or fluent word recognition and by poor spelling and decoding abilities. The magnocellular deficit theory is one of several hypotheses that have been proposed to explain the pathophysiology of DD. In this study, we investigated magnocellular system dysfunction in Japanese dyslexic children.

Children with Dyslexia_HP show cortical hyperactivation in response to increasing literacy processing demands.This fMRI study aimed to examine how differences in literacy processing demands may Affect_ASDPTO cortical activation patterns in 11- to 12-year-old children with Dyslexia_HP as compared to children with typical reading skills. Eleven children with and 18 without Dyslexia_HP were assessed using a reading paradigm based on different stages of literacy development. In the analyses, six regions showed an interaction effect between group and condition in a factorial ANOVA. These regions were selected as regions of interest (ROI) for further analyses. Overall, the Dyslexia_HP group showed cortical hyperactivation compared to the typical group. The difference between the groups tended to increase with increasing processing demands. Differences in cortical activation were not reflected in in-scanner reading performance. The six regions further grouped into three patterns, which are discussed in terms of processing demands, compensatory mechanisms, orthography and contextual facilitation. We conclude that the observed hyperactivation is chiefly a result of compensatory activity, modulated by other factors.

Atypical Sulcal Pattern in Children with Developmental Dyslexia_HP and At-Risk Kindergarteners.Developmental Dyslexia_HP (DD) is highly heritable and previous studies observed reduced cortical volume, white matter integrity, and functional alterations in Left_HP posterior brain regions in individuals with DD. The primary sulcal pattern has been hypothesized to relate to optimal organization and connections of cortical functional areas. It is determined during prenatal development and may reflect early, genetically influenced, brain development. We characterize the sulcal pattern using graph-based pattern analysis and investigate whether sulcal patterns in parieto-temporal and occipito-temporal regions are atypical in elementary school-age children with DD and pre-readers/beginning readers (preschoolers/kindergarteners) with a familial risk (elementary school-age children: n [males/females], age range = 17/11, 84-155 months; preschoolers/kindergarteners: 16/15, 59-84 months). The pattern of sulcal basin area in Left_HP parieto-temporal and occipito-temporal regions was significantly atypical (more sulcal basins of smaller size) in children with DD and further correlated with reduced reading performance on single- and nonword reading measures. A significantly atypical sulcal area pattern was also confirmed in younger preschoolers/kindergarteners with a familial risk of DD. Our results provide further support for atypical early brain development in DD and suggest that DD may originate from altered organization or connections of cortical areas in the Left_HP posterior regions.

York platelet syndrome is a CRAC channelopathy due to gain-of-function mutations in STIM1.Store-operated Ca(2+) entry is the major route of replenishment of intracellular Ca(2+) in animal cells in response to the depletion of Ca(2+) stores in the endoplasmic reticulum. It is primarily mediated by the Ca(2+)-selective release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channel, which consists of the pore-forming subunits ORAI1-3 and the Ca(2+) sensors, STIM1 and STIM2. Recessive loss-of-function mutations in STIM1 or ORAI1 result in Immunodeficiency_HP and Nonprogressive_HP Myopathy_HP. Heterozygous gain-of-function mutations in STIM1 cause non-syndromic myopathies as well as syndromic forms of Miosis_HP and Myopathy_HP with tubular aggregates and Stormorken syndrome; some of these syndromic forms are associated with Thrombocytopenia_HP. Increased concentration of Ca(2+) as a result of store-operated Ca(2+) entry is essential for platelet activation. The York Platelet syndrome (YPS) is characterized by Thrombocytopenia_HP, striking ultrastructural Abnormal_thrombocyte_morphology_HP including giant electron-opaque organelles and massive, multilayered target bodies and deficiency of platelet Ca(2+) storage in delta granules. We present clinical and molecular findings in 7 YPS patients from 4 families, demonstrating that YPS patients have a Chronic_HP Myopathy_HP associated with Rimmed_vacuoles_HP and heterozygous gain-of-function STIM1 mutations. These findings expand the phenotypic spectrum of STIM1-related human disorders and define the molecular basis of YPS.

Surface developmental Dyslexia_HP is as prevalent as phonological Dyslexia_HP when appropriate control groups are employed.Previous investigations of the incidence of developmental surface and phonological Dyslexia_HP using reading-age-matched control groups have identified many more phonological dyslexics (poor nonword reading relative to irregular-word reading) than surface dyslexics (poor irregular-word reading relative to nonword reading). However, because the measures that have been used to estimate reading age include irregular-word reading ability, they appear inappropriate for assessing the incidence of surface Dyslexia_HP. The current study used a novel method for generating control groups whose reading ability was matched to that of the dyslexic sample. The incidence of surface Dyslexia_HP was assessed by comparing dyslexic performance with that of a control group who were matched with the dyslexics on a test of nonword reading. The incidence of phonological Dyslexia_HP was assessed with reference to a control group who were matched with the dyslexics at irregular-word reading. These control groups led to the identification of an approximately equal number of children with surface and phonological Dyslexia_HP. It appeared that selecting control participants who were matched with dyslexics for reading age led to the recruitment of individuals with relatively high nonword reading scores relative to their irregular-word reading scores compared with other types of control group. The theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.

How the visual aspects can be crucial in reading acquisition? The intriguing case of crowding and developmental Dyslexia_HP.Developmental Dyslexia_HP (DD) is the most common neurodevelopmental disorder (about 10% of children across cultures) characterized by Severe_HP difficulties in learning to read. According to the dominant view, DD is considered a phonological processing impairment that might be linked to a cross-modal, letter-to-speech sound integration deficit. However, new theories-supported by consistent data-suggest that Mild_HP deficits in low-level visual and auditory processing can lead to DD. This evidence supports the probabilistic and multifactorial approach for DD. Among others, an interesting visual deficit that is often associated with DD is excessive visual crowding. Crowding is defined as difficulty in the ability to recognize objects when surrounded by similar items. Crowding, typically observed in Peripheral_HP vision, could be modulated by attentional processes. The direct consequence of stronger crowding on reading is the inability to recognize letters when they are surrounded by other letters. This problem directly translates to reading at a slower speed and being more prone to making errors while reading. Our aim is to review the literature supporting the important role of crowding in DD. Moreover, we are interested in proposing new possible studies in order to clarify whether the observed excessive crowding could be a cause rather than an effect of DD. Finally, we also suggest possible remediation and even prevention programs that could be based on reducing the crowding in children with or at risk for DD without involving any phonological or orthographic training.

Developmental Dyslexia_HP.This review uses a levels-of-analysis framework to summarize the current understanding of developmental Dyslexia_HP's etiology, brain bases, neuropsychology, and social context. Dyslexia_HP is caused by multiple genetic and environmental risk factors as well as their interplay. Several candidate genes have been identified in the past decade. At the brain level, Dyslexia_HP is associated with aberrant structure and function, particularly in Left_HP hemisphere reading/language networks. The neurocognitive influences on Dyslexia_HP are also multifactorial and involve phonological processing deficits as well as weaknesses in other oral language skills and processing speed. We address contextual issues such as how Dyslexia_HP manifests across languages and social classes as well as what treatments are best supported. Throughout the review, we highlight exciting new research that cuts across levels of analysis. Such work promises eventually to provide a comprehensive explanation of the disorder as well as its prevention and remediation.

A compensatory role for declarative memory in neurodevelopmental disorders.Most research on neurodevelopmental disorders has focused on their abnormalities. However, what remains intact may also be important. Increasing evidence suggests that declarative memory, a critical learning and memory system in the brain, remains largely functional in a number of neurodevelopmental disorders. Because declarative memory remains functional in these disorders, and because it can learn and retain numerous types of information, functions, and tasks, this system should be able to play compensatory roles for multiple types of impairments across the disorders. Here, we examine this hypothesis for specific Language_impairment_HP, Dyslexia_HP, Autistic_behavior_HP, Tourette_Syndrome_ASDPTO, and Obsessive-Compulsive_Disorder_ASDPTO. We lay out specific predictions for the hypothesis and review existing behavioral, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging evidence. Overall, the evidence suggests that declarative memory indeed plays compensatory roles for a range of impairments across all five disorders. Finally, we discuss diagnostic, therapeutic and other implications.

Altered topological organization of brain structural network in Chinese children with developmental Dyslexia_HP.Increasing evidence indicates that developmental Dyslexia_HP (DD) is a "disconnection syndrome", and new probes of connectome were applied to investigate the "disconnection" in DD. However, there is a lack of brain connectome studies of Chinese dyslexics, who may have a different neural impairment pattern due to the logographic nature of Chinese. The aim of this study was to investigate the topological organization characteristics of the DD brain using a structural network based analysis on the volumetric covariance, which is a method with the advantage of reflecting brain developmental changes. Twenty-five children diagnosed with DD and twenty-five typically developing controls were included. The structural networks based on the pair-wise correlation of gray matter volume from 90 brain regions were constructed for the two groups and compared. Compared to controls, the structural network of dyslexic children exhibited significantly increased local efficiency combined with a tendency of decreased global efficiency and Prolonged_HP characteristic path length, thus reflecting a more locally specialized topological organization. Two brain areas showed significantly altered local regional network properties: the Left_HP precentral gyrus with increased bi, and the Right_HP Heschl's gyrus with decreased bi and ki. Moreover, a series of hub regions (especially the Right_HP fronto-temporal regions) identified in the network of typically developing children were not presented in the brain of DD. To our knowledge, this is the first whole-brain structural network study on Chinese dyslexics. This study provides evidence of brain topological organization changes in Chinese children with DD, and thus may help shed light on its neurobiological basis.

How reliable are gray matter disruptions in specific Dyslexia_HP across multiple countries and languages? Insights from a large-scale voxel-based morphometry study.The neural basis of specific Dyslexia_HP (SRD) remains only partly understood. A dozen studies have used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to investigate gray matter volume (GMV) differences between SRD and control children, however, recent meta-analyses suggest that few regions are consistent across studies. We used data collected across three countries (France, Poland, and Germany) with the aim of both increasing sample size (236 SRD and controls) to obtain a clearer picture of group differences, and of further assessing the consistency of the findings across languages. VBM analysis reveals a significant group difference in a single cluster in the Left_HP thalamus. Furthermore, we observe correlations between reading accuracy and GMV in the Left_HP supramarginal gyrus and in the Left_HP cerebellum, in controls only. Most strikingly, we fail to replicate all the group differences in GMV reported in previous studies, despite the superior statistical power. The main limitation of this study is the Heterogeneous_HP of the sample drawn from different countries (i.e., speaking languages with varying orthographic transparencies) and selected based on different assessment batteries. Nevertheless, analyses within each country support the conclusions of the cross-linguistic analysis. Explanations for the discrepancy between the present and previous studies may include: (1) the limited suitability of VBM to reveal the subtle brain disruptions underlying SRD; (2) insufficient correction for multiple statistical tests and flexibility in data analysis, and (3) publication bias in favor of positive results. Thus the study echoes widespread concerns about the risk of false-positive results inherent to small-scale VBM studies.

How to constrain and maintain a lexicon for the treatment of Progressive_HP semantic naming deficits: Principles of item selection for formal semantic therapy.The Progressive_HP degradation of semantic memory is a common feature of many forms of Dementia_HP, including Alzheimer's disease and the semantic variant of primary Progressive_HP Aphasia_HP (svPPA). One of the most functionally debilitating effects of this semantic impairment is the inability to name common people and objects (i.e., Anomia_HP). Clinical management of a Progressive_HP, semantically based Anomia_HP presents extraordinary challenges for neurorehabilitation. Techniques such as errorless learning and spaced-retrieval training show promise for retraining forgotten words. However, we lack complementary detail about what to train (i.e., item selection) and how to flexibly adapt the training to a declining cognitive system. This Position_HP paper weighs the relative merits of several treatment rationales (e.g., restore vs. compensate) and advocates for maintenance of known words over reacquisition of forgotten knowledge in the context of semantic treatment paradigms. I propose a system for generating an item pool and outline a set of core principles for training and sustaining a micro-lexicon consisting of approximately 100 words. These principles are informed by lessons learned over the course of a Phase I treatment study targeting language maintenance over a 5-year span in Alzheimer's disease and SvPPA. Finally, I propose a semantic training approach that capitalises on lexical Frequency_HP and repeated training on conceptual structure to offset the loss of key vocabulary as disease Severity_HP worsens.

Cortical thickness abnormalities associated with Dyslexia_HP, independent of remediation status.Abnormalities in cortical structure are commonly observed in children with Dyslexia_HP in key regions of the "reading network." Whether alteration in cortical features reflects pathology inherent to Dyslexia_HP or environmental influence (e.g., impoverished reading experience) remains unclear. To address this question, we compared MRI-derived metrics of cortical thickness (CT), surface area (SA), gray matter volume (GMV), and their lateralization across three different groups of children with a historical Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Dyslexia_HP, who varied in current reading level. We compared three Dyslexia_HP subgroups with: (1) persistent reading and spelling impairment; (2) remediated reading impairment (normal reading scores), and (3) remediated reading and spelling impairments (normal reading and spelling scores); and a control group of (4) typically developing children. All groups were matched for age, gender, handedness, and IQ. We hypothesized that the Dyslexia_HP group would show cortical abnormalities in regions of the reading network relative to controls, irrespective of remediation status. Such a finding would support that cortical abnormalities are inherent to Dyslexia_HP and are not a consequence of abnormal reading experience. Results revealed increased CT of the Left_HP fusiform gyrus in the Dyslexia_HP group relative to controls. Similarly, the Dyslexia_HP group showed CT increase of the Right_HP superior temporal gyrus, extending into the planum temporale, which resulted in a Right_HPward CT asymmetry on lateralization indices. There were no group differences in SA, GMV, or their lateralization. These findings held true regardless of remediation status. Each reading level group showed the same "double hit" of atypically increased Left_HP fusiform CT and Right_HPward superior temporal CT asymmetry. Thus, findings provide evidence that a developmental history of Dyslexia_HP is associated with CT abnormalities, independent of remediation status.

Boys, not girls, are negatively Affected_HP on cognitive tasks by Lead_Exposure_ASDPTO: a pilot study.The study described in this article provides behavioral evidence that boys experience the deleterious cognitive effects of lead more than girls do. In fact, girls with elevated blood lead levels (BLLs - 10 μg/dL) performed as well as girls without elevated BLLs on behavioral measures of cognition. This was shown by testing Executive_Function_ASDPTO and reading readiness skills of 40 young children (aged three to six years; 23 with elevated blood lead levels, 17 without) residing within a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-designated lead Superfund site. The results also indicate that elevated BLLs are related to a more pronounced negative impact on Executive_Function_ASDPTO than on reading readiness. These findings support recent research on adults indicating that Lead_Exposure_ASDPTO is related to atrophy within the prefrontal cortex and other work suggesting that estrogen and estradiol may act as neuroprotectants against the negative impact of neurotoxins.

Morphological Awareness and Its Role in Compensation in Adults with Dyslexia_HP.This study examines the role of morphological awareness (MA) in literacy achievement and compensation in word reading of adults with Dyslexia_HP through an exploration of three questions: (1) Do adult dyslexics demonstrate a deficit in MA, and how is this potential deficit related to phonological awareness (PA)? (2) Does MA contribute independently to literacy skills equally in dyslexics and control readers? and (3) Do MA and PA skills differ in compensated and noncompensated dyslexics? A group of dyslexic and normal reading university students matched for age, education and IQ participated in this study. Group analysis demonstrated an MA deficit in dyslexics; as well, MA was found to significantly predict a greater proportion of word reading and spelling within the dyslexic group compared with the controls. Compensated dyslexics were also found to perform significantly better on the morphological task than noncompensated dyslexics. Additionally, no statistical difference was observed in MA between the normal reading controls and the compensated group (independent of PA and vocabulary). Results suggest that intact and strong MA skills contribute to the achieved compensation of this group of adults with Dyslexia_HP. Implications for MA based intervention strategies for people with Dyslexia_HP are discussed.

A new self-report inventory of Dyslexia_HP for students: criterion and construct validity.The validity of a Dutch self-report inventory of Dyslexia_HP was ascertained in two samples of students. Six biographical questions, 20 general language statements and 56 specific language statements were based on Dyslexia_HP as a multi-dimensional deficit. Dyslexia_HP and non-Dyslexia_HP were assessed with two criteria: identification with test results (Sample 1) and classification using biographical information (both samples). Using discriminant analyses, these criteria were predicted with various groups of statements. All together, 11 discriminant functions were used to estimate classification accuracy of the inventory. In Sample 1, 15 statements predicted the test criterion with classification accuracy of 98%, and 18 statements predicted the biographical criterion with classification accuracy of 97%. In Sample 2, 16 statements predicted the biographical criterion with classification accuracy of 94%. Estimations of positive and negative predictive value were 89% and 99%. Items of various discriminant functions were factor analysed to find characteristic difficulties of students with Dyslexia_HP, resulting in a five-factor structure in Sample 1 and a four-factor structure in Sample 2. Answer bias was investigated with measures of internal consistency reliability. Less than 20 self-report items are sufficient to accurately classify students with and without Dyslexia_HP. This supports the usefulness of self-assessment of Dyslexia_HP as a valid alternative to diagnostic test batteries.

Word Position_HP and stress effects in consonant cluster perception and production.The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the saliency effect for word beginnings reported in children with Dyslexia_HP (Marshall & Van der Lely, 2009) can be found also in typically developing children. Thirty-four typically developing Italian children aged 8-10 years completed two specifically designed tasks: a production task and a perception task. Both tasks used nonwords containing clusters consisting of plosive plus liquid (e.g. pl). Clusters could be either in a stressed or in an unstressed syllable and could be either in initial Position_HP (first syllable) or in medial Position_HP (second syllable). In the production task, children were asked to repeat the nonwords. In the perception task, the children were asked to discriminate between two nonwords differing in one phoneme belonging to a cluster by reporting whether two repetitions were the same or different. Results from the production task showed that children are more accurate in repeating stressed than unstressed syllables, but there was no difference with respect to Position_HP of the cluster. Results from the perception task showed that children performed more accurately when discriminating word initial contrasts than when discriminating word medial contrasts, especially if the cluster was unstressed. Implications of this finding for clinical assessments are discussed.

Orthographic learning in developmental surface and phonological Dyslexia_HP.Phonological decoding skill has been proposed to be key to successful sight word learning (orthographic learning). However, little is known about how children with phonological Dyslexia_HP, who have impaired phonological decoding, acquire sight words, or why children with surface Dyslexia_HP can have normal phonological decoding skill yet impaired sight word acquisition. This study addressed this issue by investigating orthographic learning in two 10-year-old children: S.D., with a reading profile of surface Dyslexia_HP, and P.D., with a reading profile of phonological Dyslexia_HP. They participated in two experiments exploring the role of phonological decoding and paired-associate learning in orthographic learning. The results showed that, first, P.D.'s orthographic learning ability was better than S.D.'s, despite her phonological decoding skills being poorer. Second, S.D. showed impaired paired-associate learning abilities while P.D. did not. Overall, the results indicate that phonological decoding ability does not translate directly to orthographic learning ability, and that paired-associate learning ability may also be associated with success in orthographic learning.

Genetic differential susceptibility in literacy-delayed children: a randomized controlled trial on emergent literacy in kindergarten.In this randomized controlled trial, 508 5-year-old kindergarten children participated, of whom 257 were delayed in literacy skills because they belonged to the lowest quartile of a national standard literacy test. We tested the hypothesis that some children are more susceptible to school-entry educational interventions than their peers due to their genetic makeup, and thus whether the dopamine receptor D4 gene moderated intervention effects. Children were randomly assigned to a control condition or one of two interventions involving computer programs tailored to the literacy needs of delayed pupils: Living Letters for alphabetic knowledge and Living Books for text comprehension. Effects of Living Books met the criteria of differential susceptibility. For carriers of the dopamine receptor D4 gene seven-repeat allele (about one-third of the delayed group), the Living Books program was an important addition to the common core curriculum in kindergarten (effect size d = 0.56), whereas the program did not Affect_ASDPTO the other children (d = -0.09). The same seven-repeat carriers benefited more from Living Letters than did the noncarriers, as reflected in effect sizes of 0.63 and 0.34, respectively, although such differences did not fulfill the statistical criteria for differential susceptibility. The implications of differential susceptibility for education and regarding the crucial question "what works for whom?" are discussed.

For carriers of the dopamine receptor D4 gene seven-repeat allele (about one-third of the delayed group), the Living Books program was an important addition to the common core curriculum in kindergarten (effect size d = 0.56), whereas the program did not affect the other children (d = -0.09). The same seven-repeat carriers benefited more from Living Letters than did the noncarriers, as reflected in effect sizes of 0.63 and 0.34, respectively, although such differences did not fulfill the statistical criteria for differential susceptibility. The implications of differential susceptibility for education and regarding the crucial question "what works for whom?" are discussed.
Impaired recognition of faces and objects in Dyslexia_HP: Evidence for ventral stream dysfunction?The objective of this study was to establish whether or not dyslexics are impaired at the recognition of faces and other complex nonword visual objects. This would be expected based on a meta-analysis revealing that children and adult dyslexics show functional abnormalities within the Left_HP fusiform gyrus, a brain region high up in the ventral visual stream, which is thought to support the recognition of words, faces, and other objects.

Association study of Stuttering_HP candidate genes GNPTAB, GNPTG and NAGPA with Dyslexia_HP in Chinese population.Dyslexia_HP is a polygenic speech and Language_impairment_HP characterized by an unexpected difficulty in reading in children and adults despite normal intelligence and schooling. Increasing evidence reveals that different speech and Language_impairment_HP could share common genetic factors. As previous study reported association of GNPTAB, GNPTG and NAGPA with Stuttering_HP, we investigated these genes with Dyslexia_HP through association analysis.

Temporal variability predicts the magnitude of between-group attentional blink differences in developmental Dyslexia_HP: a meta-analysis.Background. Here we report on a meta-analysis of the between-group main effect (Group Difference) noted in the attentional blink (AB) research focused on specific reading impairment, commonly referred to as developmental Dyslexia_HP. The AB effect relates to a limitation in the allocation of attention over time and is examined in a dual-target rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigm. When the second target appears in close temporal proximity to the first target, the second target is reported less accurately. Method. A Web of Science search with terms "attentional blink" & Dyslexia_HP returned 13 AB experiments (11 papers) conducted with developmental Dyslexia_HP. After exclusions, 12 experiments were included in the meta-analysis. The main pattern of performance from those experiments was lower overall accuracy in groups of individuals with Dyslexia_HP relative to typically reading peers; that is, a between-group main effect. This meta-analysis examined the size of the Group Difference in relation to temporal and task-set related features, which differed between and within experiments. Results. Random effects modelling indicated a significant Group Difference of -0.74 standard deviation units, 95% CI [-.96, -.52], p < .001 (excluding one anomalous result): implicating significantly poorer overall dual-target performance in dyslexic readers. Meta-regression analyses indicated two variables related to the Group Difference; pre-RSVP time and temporal variability of the second target relative to the first target within the RSVP. Discussion. It is suggested that the endogenous engagement of the temporal features of task-set is slower or disrupted in developmental Dyslexia_HP.

The music perception performance of children with and without Dyslexia_HP in Taiwan.Some Western studies have suggested a strong relation between musical discrimination abilities and reading-related skills. Music processing abilities and reading-related skills were evaluated for typically developing children and children with Dyslexia_HP. The results showed that pitch discrimination abilities of Chinese dyslexic children are not different from those of typically developing children. However, the former have poorer rhythm Imitation_ASDPTO abilities. Thus, in Chinese reading there is a strong relation between rhythm and reading acquisition, which is consistent with the research results on alphabetic languages. On the other hand, a significant correlation existed between the rhythm Imitation_ASDPTO ability and performance on the Onset_HP deletion test for all participants, which suggested that there was a close relation between the function of organizing the distinctive features in appropriate rhythmic pattern and the segmental phonological processing deficits of dyslexic children.

Emotional experience with Dyslexia_HP and self-esteem: the protective role of perceived family support in late adulthood.Despite the growing body of evidence that suggests Dyslexia_HP persists through the life span, there is a dearth of research that explores the complicating factor of Dyslexia_HP in late adulthood. Based upon stress and coping theory, this study examined whether perceived family support protects the impact of negative emotional experience with Dyslexia_HP on self-esteem.

Greater functional connectivity between reading and error-detection regions following training with the reading acceleration program in children with reading difficulties.The Reading Acceleration Program is a computerized program that improves reading and the activation of the error-detection mechanism in individuals with reading difficulty (RD) and typical readers (TRs). The current study aims to find the neural correlates for this effect in English-speaking 8-12-year-old children with RD and TRs using a functional connectivity analysis. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected during a lexical decision task before and after 4 weeks of training with the program, together with reading and executive functions measures. Results indicated improvement in reading, visual attention, and speed of processing in children with RD. Following training, greater functional connectivity was observed between the Left_HP fusiform gyrus and the Right_HP anterior cingulate cortex in children with RD and between the Left_HP fusiform gyrus and the Left_HP anterior cingulate cortex in TRs. The change in functional connectivity after training was correlated with increased behavioral scores for word reading and visual attention in both groups. The results support previous findings of improved monitoring and mental lexicon after training with the Reading Acceleration Program in children with RD and TRs. The differences in Laterality_HP of the anterior cingulate cortex in children with RD and the presumable role of the cingulo-opercular control network in language processing are discussed.

The role of executive functions in bilingual children with reading difficulties.To explore the joint effect of reading difficulties (RD) and bilingualism on executive functions, 190 children of four groups of 9-12 year-olds (41 bilinguals with RD, 45 monolinguals with RD, 45 bilinguals without RD, and 59 monolinguals without RD) were examined on the Concentration game, Tower of Hanoi, and Stroop as measures of executive functioning tapping into inhibitory/attentional control, Working_Memory_ASDPTO and Planning_ASDPTO ability. The most prominent finding was that in terms of RD, the speed of performances decreased dramatically. This general decrease was more pronounced for bilingual children with RD than for their monolingual counterparts. In conclusion, the findings suggest that while bilinguals gain more from executive functions in normal reading, they lose in terms of RD. Such an outcome confirms that executive functions are essential components of both reading and bilingualism, which depending on whether reading conditions are normal or difficult will produce cognitive advantages or disadvantages. Further, it is argued that dissimilarity between the Farsi and Swedish languages may complicate handling of such a situation.

Behavioural Difficulties That Co-occur With Specific Word Reading Difficulties: A UK Population-Based Cohort Study.This study aimed to examine the association between specific word reading difficulties (SWRD) identified at age 7 years using a discrepancy approach and subsequent dimensional measures of behavioural difficulties reported by teachers and parents at age 11 years. Behavioural problems were assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Secondary analysis of a UK representative population-based sample of children (n = 12,631) was conducted using linear regression models. There were 284 children (2.2%) identified with SWRD at age 7 years. Children with SWRD had significantly higher scores on all measures of behavioural difficulties in unadjusted analysis. SWRD was associated with elevated behavioural difficulties at age 11 years according to parent report, and with greater emotional problems, Hyperactivity_HP and conduct issues according to teachers, even after having controlled for baseline difficulties. These results were replicated for children with low reading attainment, but no Cognitive_Ability_ASDPTO discrepancy. Categories of special educational need into which children with SWRD were classed at school were varied. Given high rates of co-occurring behavioural difficulties, assessment that identifies each individual child's specific functional, rather than categorical, difficulties is likely to be the most effective way of providing classroom support.

Impaired oculo-motor behaviour affects both reading and scene perception in neglect patients.Unilateral_HP spatial neglect (USN) is a common neuropsychological disorder following a Right_HP brain lesion. Although USN is mostly characterized by symptoms involving the Left_HP hemispace, other symptoms are not Left_HP lateralized. Recently, it was shown that patients with neglect Dyslexia_HP, a reading disturbance that affects about 40% of USN patients, manifest a non-lateralized impairment of eye movement behaviour in association with their reading deficit when they read aloud and perform non-verbal saccadic tasks (Primativo et al., 2013). In the present paper, we aimed to demonstrate that the eye movement impairment shown by some USN patients reflects a more general oculo-motor disorder that is not confined to orthographic material, the horizontal axis or constrained saccadic tasks. We conjectured that inaccurate oculo-motor behaviour in USN patients indicates the presence of a reading deficit. With this aim we evaluated 20 patients, i.e., 10 Right_HP brain-damaged patients without neglect and 10 patients Affected_HP by USN. On the basis of the patients' eye movement patterns during a scene exploration task, we found that 4 out of the 10 USN patients presented an abnormal oculo-motor pattern. These same four patients (but not the others) also failed in performing 5 different saccadic tasks and produced neglect Dyslexia_HP reading errors in both single words and texts. First, we show that a large proportion of USN patients have inaccurate eye movement behaviour in non-reading tasks. Second, we demonstrate that this exploratory deficit is predictive of the reading impairment. Thus, we conclude that the eye movement deficit prevents reading and impairs the performance on many other perceptual tests, including scene exploration. The large percentage of patients with impaired eye-movement pattern suggests that particular attention should be paid to eye movement behaviour during the diagnostic phase in order to program the best rehabilitation strategy for each patient.

The need to differentiate the magnocellular system from the dorsal stream in connection with Dyslexia_HP.A number of authors have postulated a "magnocellular-dorsal stream" deficit in Dyslexia_HP. Combining the magnocellular system and the dorsal stream into a single entity in this context faces the problem that contrast sensitivity data do not point to a magnocellular deficiency linked to Dyslexia_HP, while, on the other hand, motion perception data are largely consistent with a dorsal stream dysfunction. Thus, there are data both for and against a "magnocellular-dorsal stream" deficit in connection with Dyslexia_HP. It is here pointed out that this inconsistency is abolished once it is recognized that the magnocellular system and the dorsal stream are separate entities.

To read or not to read: a neurophysiological study.Pure Alexia_HP (PA) has been associated with visual deficits or a failure to activate the visual word form area (VWFA). We report a patient with pure Alexia_HP due to posterior Cerebral_cortical_atrophy_HP, in whom event-related potentials revealed a delay in the P100 component and an absent N170 compared with controls. Furthermore, there was a tendency for a larger delay in P100 latencies associated with incorrectly read words. This suggests that some cases of PA might result from deficits in Visual_Perception_ASDPTO, signaled by the P100 early potential which could lead to an inability to consistently activate the VWFA, marked by the absent N170.

Improved reading measures in adults with Dyslexia_HP following transcranial direct current stimulation treatment.To better understand the contribution of the dorsal system to word reading, we explored transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) effects when adults with developmental Dyslexia_HP received active stimulation over the visual extrastriate area MT/V5, which is dominated by magnocellular input. Stimulation was administered in 5 sessions spread over two weeks, and reading speed and accuracy as well as reading fluency were assessed before, immediately after, and a week after the end of the treatment. A control group of adults with developmental Dyslexia_HP matched for age, gender, reading level, vocabulary and block-design WAIS-III sub-tests and reading level was exposed to the same protocol but with sham stimulation. The results revealed that active, but not sham stimulation, significantly improved reading speed and fluency. This finding suggests that the dorsal stream may play a role in efficient retrieval from the orthographic input lexicon in the lexical route. It also underscores the potential of tDCS as an intervention tool for improving reading speed, at least in adults with developmental Dyslexia_HP.

'MetaTaal': enhancing complex syntax in children with specific Language_impairment_HP--a metalinguistic and multimodal approach.Currently, most research on the effective treatment of morphosyntax in children with specific Language_impairment_HP (SLI) pertains to younger children. In the last two decades, several studies have provided evidence that intervention for older school-age children with SLI can be effective. These metalinguistic intervention approaches teach grammatical rules explicitly and use shapes and colours as two-dimensional visual support. Reading or writing activities form a substantial part of these interventions. However, some children with SLI are poor readers and might benefit more from an approach that is less dependent on literacy skills.

Double-Deficit Hypothesis in a Clinical Sample: Extension Beyond Reading.This study explored the double-deficit hypothesis (DDH) in a transparent orthography (Finnish) and extended the view from reading disabilities to comorbidity of learning-related problems in math and attention. Children referred for evaluation of learning disabilities in second through sixth grade (N = 205) were divided into four groups based on rapid automatized naming (RAN) and phonological awareness (PA) according to the DDH: the double-deficit group, the naming speed deficit-only group, the phonological deficit-only group, and the no-deficit group. The results supported the DDH in that the prevalence and Severity_HP of Dyslexia_HP were greatest in the double-deficit group. Despite the greater prevalence of reading disabilities in single-deficit groups compared to the no-deficit group, the means of reading measures in the single-deficit groups were similar to those of the no-deficit group. The PA single-deficit group was poorer in spelling than the no-deficit group and single-naming-deficit group. Deficits in RAN or PA were primarily linked to reading disabilities but not with math or attention problems. The results supported the DDH partially and indicate that deficits in RAN and PA are specific to reading disabilities.

Reading disabilities in children: A selective meta-analysis of the cognitive literature.This article synthesizes literature that compares the academic, cognitive, and behavioral performance of children with and without reading disabilities (RD). Forty-eight studies met the criteria for the meta-analysis, yielding 735 effect sizes (ESs) with an overall weighted ES of 0.98. Small to high ESs in favor of children without RD emerged on measures of cognition (rapid naming [ES = 0.89], phonological awareness [ES = 1.00], verbal Working_Memory_ASDPTO [ES = 0.79], short-term memory [ES = 0.56], visual-spatial memory [ES = 0.48], and executive processing [ES = 0.67]), academic achievement (pseudoword reading [ES = 1.85], math [ES = 1.20], vocabulary [ES = 0.83], spelling [ES = 1.25], and writing [ES = 1.20]), and behavior skills (ES = 0.80). Hierarchical linear modeling indicated that specific cognitive process measures (verbal Working_Memory_ASDPTO, visual-spatial memory, executive processing, and short-term memory) and intelligence measures (general and verbal intelligence) significantly moderated overall group effect size differences. Overall, the results supported the assumption that Cognitive_impairment_HP in children with RD are persistent.

Probabilistic category learning in developmental Dyslexia_HP: Evidence from feedback and paired-associate weather prediction tasks.Developmental Dyslexia_HP is presumed to arise from specific phonological impairments. However, an emerging theoretical framework suggests that phonological impairments may be symptoms stemming from an underlying dysfunction of procedural learning.

The utility of neuroimaging studies for informing educational practice and policy in reading disorders.Educational neuroscience is an emerging scientific field that brings together researchers from neuroscience, psychology, and education to explore the neurocognitive processes underlying educational practice and theory. In this brief article, we take reading disorder (RD, also known as developmental Dyslexia_HP) as an example, and explore trends in neuroimaging research, which may have future implications for educational practice and policy. Specifically, we present two examples that have been Central_HP to research efforts in our laboratory: (a) utilizing multimodal neuroimaging to optimize criteria to diagnose RD, and (b) identifying neuroimaging markers that predict future academic outcomes. Such research is faced with important challenges, and rigorous validation is necessary before any claims of the widespread practical utility of neuroimaging can be made. Nevertheless, we contend that neuroimaging studies offer opportunities for providing critical information that could lead to advancing theory of reading and RD. This could in turn lead to better diagnostic criteria and more accurate and earlier identification of RD.

Procedural Learning in Children With Developmental Coordination, Reading, and Attention Disorders.The aim is to assess repetition-based learning of procedures in children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD), reading disorder (RD) and attention-deficit Hyperactivity_HP disorder (ADHD). Participants included 187 children, studied in 4 groups: (a) DCD comorbid with RD and ADHD (DCD+RD+ADHD) (n = 30); (b) RD comorbid with ADHD (RD+ADHD) (n = 48); (c) ADHD (n = 19); and typically developing children (control group) (n = 90). Two procedural learning tasks were used: Assembly learning and Mirror drawing. Children were tested on 4 occasions for each task: 3 trials were consecutive and the fourth trial was performed after an interference task. Task_Performance_ASDPTO by DCD+RD+ADHD children improved with training (P < .05); however, the improvement was significantly lower than that achieved by the other groups (RD+ADHD, ADHD and controls) (P < .05). In conclusion, children with DCD+RD+ADHD improve in their use of cognitive-motor procedures over a short training period. Aims of intervention in DCD+RD+ADHD should be based on individual learning abilities.

Neuroscience illuminating the influence of auditory or phonological intervention on language-related deficits.Remediation programs for language-related learning deficits are urgently needed to enable equal opportunities in education. To meet this need, different training and intervention programs have been developed. Here we review, from an educational perspective, studies that have explored the neural basis of Behavioral_abnormality_HP induced by auditory or phonological training in Dyslexia_HP, specific Language_impairment_HP (SLI), and language-learning impairment (LLI). Training has been shown to induce plastic changes in deficient neural networks. In Dyslexia_HP, these include, most consistently, increased or normalized activation of previously hypoactive inferior frontal and occipito-temporal areas. In SLI and LLI, studies have shown the strengthening of previously weak auditory brain responses as a result of training. The combination of behavioral and brain measures of remedial gains has potential to increase the understanding of the causes of language-related deficits, which may help to target remedial interventions more accurately to the core problem.

Effective learning and retention of braille letter tactile discrimination skills in children with developmental Dyslexia_HP.Children with developmental Dyslexia_HP (DD) may differ from typical readers in aspects other than reading. The notion of a general deficit in the ability to acquire and retain procedural ('how to') knowledge as long-term procedural memory has been proposed. Here, we compared the ability of elementary school children, with and without reading difficulties (DD, typical readers), to improve their tactile discrimination with practice and tested the children's ability to retain the gains. Forty 10-11-year-olds practiced the tactile discrimination of four braille letters, presented as pairs, while blindfolded. In a trial, participants were asked to report whether the target stimuli were identical or different from each other. The structured training session consisted of six blocks of 16 trials each. Performance was re-tested at 24 hours and two weeks post-training. Both groups improved in speed and in accuracy. In session 1, children with DD started as significantly less accurate and were slower than the typical readers but showed rapid learning and successfully closed the gap. Only two children with DD failed to benefit from training and were not included in subsequent data analyses. At 24 hours post-training both groups showed effective retention of the gains in speed and accuracy. Importantly, children with DD were able to retain the gains in speed and accuracy, over a two-week interval as effectively as typical readers. Thus, children with DD were as effective in the acquisition and retention of tactile discrimination of braille letters as typical readers of the same age. The results do not support the notion of a general procedural learning disability in DD.

Review of neural rehabilitation programs for Dyslexia_HP: how can an allophonic system be changed into a phonemic one?Neural investigations suggest that there are three possible core deficits in Dyslexia_HP: phonemic, grapho-phonemic, and graphemic. These investigations also suggest that the phonemic deficit resides in a different mode of speech perception which is based on allophonic (subphonemic) units rather than phonemic units. Here we review the results of remediation methods that tap into each of these core deficits, and examine how the methods that tap into the phonemic deficit might contribute to the remediation of allophonic perception. Remediation of grapho-phonemic deficiencies with a new computerized phonics training program (GraphoGame) might be able to surpass the limits of classical phonics training programs, particularly with regard to reading fluency. Remediation of visuo-graphemic deficiencies through exposure to enhanced letter spacing is also promising, although children with Dyslexia_HP continued to read more slowly than typical readers after this type of training. Remediation of phonemic deficiencies in Dyslexia_HP with programs based solely on phonemic awareness has a limited impact on reading. This might be due to the persistence of a covert deficit in phonemic perception. Methods based on slowed speech enhance the perception not only of phonemic features but also of allophonic features, and this is probably why they have not been found to be effective in meta-analyses. Training of phonemic perception with a perceptual fading paradigm, a method that improves precision in identification and discrimination around phonemic boundaries, has yielded promising results. However, studies with children at risk for Dyslexia_HP and dyslexic adults have found that even when behavioral data do not reflect allophonic perception, it can nevertheless be present in neural recordings. Further investigations should seek to confirm that the perceptual fading paradigm is beneficial for reading, and that it renders perception truly phonemic.

Verbal memory and literacy outcomes one year after pediatric temporal lobectomy: a retrospective cohort study.In children with temporal lobe Epilepsy_ASDPTO (TLE), temporal lobectomy (TL) is a treatment of choice for those children with Seizures_HP that are difficult to control with medication. Semantic memory is dependent on functional integrity of the temporal lobes and is thought to be critical for development of literacy skills. However, little is known about semantic memory and literacy outcomes post-TL in children.

Late-Emerging and Resolving Dyslexia_HP: A Follow-Up Study from Age 3 to 14.This study focuses on the stability of Dyslexia_HP status from Grade 2 to Grade 8 in four groups: (a) no Dyslexia_HP in either grade (no-Dyslexia_HP, n = 127); (b) no Dyslexia_HP in Grade 2 but Dyslexia_HP in Grade 8 (late-emerging, n = 18); (c) Dyslexia_HP in Grade 2 but not in Grade 8 (resolving, n = 15); and (d) Dyslexia_HP in both grades (persistent-Dyslexia_HP, n = 22). We examined group differences from age 3.5 to age 14 in (a) reading, vocabulary, phonology, letter knowledge, rapid naming, IQ, verbal memory; (b) familial and environmental risk and supportive factors; and (c) parental skills in reading, phonology, rapid naming, verbal memory, and vocabulary. Our findings showed group differences both in reading and cognitive skills of children as well as their parents. Parental education, book-reading Frequency_HP, and children's IQ, however, did not differentiate the groups. The children in the persistent-Dyslexia_HP group exhibited widespread language and Cognitive_impairment_HP across development. Those in the resolving group had problems in language and cognitive skills only prior to school entry. In the late-emerging group, children showed clearly compromised rapid naming. Additionally, their parents had the most Severe_HP difficulties in rapid naming, a finding that suggests strong genetic liability. The findings show instability in the Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Dyslexia_HP. The members of the late-emerging group did not have a distinct early cognitive profile, so late-emerging Dyslexia_HP appears difficult to predict. Indeed, these children are at risk of not being identified and not receiving required support. This study suggests the need for continued monitoring of children's progress in literacy after the early school years.

Short- and long-term rhythmic interventions: perspectives for language rehabilitation.This paper brings together different perspectives on the investigation and understanding of temporal processing and temporal expectations. We aim to bridge different temporal deficit hypotheses in Dyslexia_HP, Dysphasia_HP, or Hearing_impairment_HP in a larger framework, taking into account multiple nested temporal scales. We present data testing the hypothesis that temporal attention can be influenced by external rhythmic auditory stimulation (i.e., musical rhythm) and benefits subsequent language processing, including syntax processing and speech production. We also present data testing the hypothesis that phonological awareness can be influenced by several months of musical training and, more particularly, rhythmic training, which in turn improves reading skills. Together, our data support the hypothesis of a causal role of rhythm-based processing for language processing and acquisition. These results open new avenues for music-based remediation of language and Hearing_impairment_HP.

A Patient With Alexia_HP in the Seventeenth Century.Johann Jakob Wepfer (1620-1695), city physician in Schaffhausen, Switzerland, published two books on "apoplexy." He proposed new ideas about the events in the brain during such attacks, based on Harvey's theory of the circulation of the blood. Wepfer postulated extravasation of whole blood or serum in the brain, in opposition to the Galenic notion of blocked ventricles. His case histories are remarkably precise and untainted by interpretation. This allows the recognition of a patient with Alexia_HP, who was also unable to read words written by himself. Unlike patients with pure "Alexia_HP without agraphia," he could not write complete sentences because of additional language defects, especially speech comprehension. Jules Dejerine (1849-1917) would, in 1892, not only describe a patient with the pure form of this syndrome (cécité verbale avec intégrité de l'écriture spontanée et sous dictée) but also provide an explanation of its anatomical basis.

Lack of replication for the myosin-18B association with mathematical ability in independent cohorts.Twin studies indicate that Dyscalculia_HP (or mathematical disability) is caused partly by a genetic component, which is yet to be understood at the molecular level. Recently, a coding variant (rs133885) in the myosin-18B gene was shown to be associated with mathematical abilities with a specific effect among children with Dyslexia_HP. This association represents one of the most significant genetic associations reported to date for mathematical abilities and the only one reaching genome-wide statistical significance. We conducted a replication study in different cohorts to assess the effect of rs133885 maths-related measures. The study was conducted primarily using the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), (N = 3819). We tested additional cohorts including the York Cohort, the Specific Language_impairment_HP Consortium (SLIC) cohort and the Raine Cohort, and stratified them for a definition of Dyslexia_HP whenever possible. We did not observe any associations between rs133885 in myosin-18B and mathematical abilities among individuals with Dyslexia_HP or in the general population. Our results suggest that the myosin-18B variant is unlikely to be a main factor contributing to mathematical abilities.

The DYX2 locus and neurochemical signaling genes contribute to speech sound disorder and related neurocognitive domains.A major milestone of child development is the acquisition and use of speech and language. Communication disorders, including speech sound disorder (SSD), can impair a child's academic, social and behavioral development. Speech sound disorder is a complex, polygenic trait with a substantial genetic component. However, specific genes that contribute to SSD remain largely unknown. To identify associated genes, we assessed the association of the DYX2 Dyslexia_HP risk locus and markers in neurochemical signaling genes (e.g., nicotinic and dopaminergic) with SSD and related endophenotypes. We first performed separate primary associations in two independent samples - Cleveland SSD (210 Affected_HP and 257 unAffected_HP individuals in 127 families) and Denver SSD (113 Affected_HP individuals and 106 unAffected_HP individuals in 85 families) - and then combined results by meta-analysis. DYX2 markers, specifically those in the 3' untranslated region of DCDC2 (P = 1.43 × 10(-4) ), showed the strongest associations with phonological awareness. We also observed suggestive associations of dopaminergic-related genes ANKK1 (P = 1.02 × 10(-2) ) and DRD2 (P = 9.22 × 10(-3) ) and nicotinic-related genes CHRNA3 (P = 2.51 × 10(-3) ) and BDNF (P = 8.14 × 10(-3) ) with case-control status and articulation. Our results further implicate variation in putative regulatory regions in the DYX2 locus, particularly in DCDC2, influencing language and cognitive traits. The results also support previous studies implicating variation in dopaminergic and nicotinic neural signaling influencing human communication and cognitive development. Our findings expand the literature showing genetic factors (e.g., DYX2) contributing to multiple related, yet distinct neurocognitive domains (e.g., Dyslexia_HP, Language_impairment_HP, and SSD). How these factors interactively yield different neurocognitive and language-related outcomes remains to be elucidated.

Differences in neurocognitive aspects of Dyslexia_HP in Dutch and immigrant 6-7- and 8-9-years old children.Detecting Dyslexia_HP in immigrant children can be jeopardized because of assessment bias, as a consequence of a limited word lexicon or differences in Language_Development_ASDPTO of these children. This is in contrast with the view of the universal neurocognitive basis for Dyslexia_HP. In this research, differences in screening children at risk for Dyslexia_HP with the Dyslexia_HP Screening Test (DST) were studied in third and fifth graders of primary school of Dutch (mainstream) and immigrant descent. Mean group differences were found on a few subtests (Naming Letters, Semantic Fluency, Backward Digit Span and Verbal Fluency), probably as a consequence of bias because of the linguistic character of these subtests. The raw scores of word lexicon increased in the Dutch and immigrant group. The association of having a Dyslexia_HP Diagnosis_ASDPTO on DST scores was comparable for Dutch and immigrant children. Differences in the DST scores between non-dyslexic and dyslexic children were found between the third and fifth grade, with a stronger effect of having a Dyslexia_HP Diagnosis_ASDPTO in the fifth grade than the third grade, for Dutch as well as immigrant children. Screening of Dyslexia_HP seems easier in the fifth grade than in the third grade, dyslexic children show a slower reading development than their non-dyslexic peers, irrespective of their cultural background.

The raw scores of word lexicon increased in the Dutch and immigrant group. The association of having a dyslexia diagnosis on DST scores was comparable for Dutch and immigrant children. Differences in the DST scores between non-dyslexic and dyslexic children were found between the third and fifth grade, with a stronger effect of having a dyslexia diagnosis in the fifth grade than the third grade, for Dutch as well as immigrant children. Screening of dyslexia seems easier in the fifth grade than in the third grade, dyslexic children show a slower reading development than their non-dyslexic peers, irrespective of their cultural background.
Differences in neurocognitive aspects of dyslexia in Dutch and immigrant 6-7- and 8-9-years old children.Detecting dyslexia in immigrant children can be jeopardized because of assessment bias, as a consequence of a limited word lexicon or differences in language development of these children. This is in contrast with the view of the universal neurocognitive basis for dyslexia.

Training a new generation of speech-language pathologists with competences in the management of literacy disorders and learning disabilities in Hong Kong.One of the recent developments in the education of speech-language pathology is to include literacy disorders and learning disabilities as key training components in the training curriculum. Disorders in Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO are interwoven with disorders in speaking and listening, which should be managed holistically, particularly in children and adolescents. With extensive training in clinical linguistics, language disorders, and other theoretical knowledge and clinical skills, speech-language pathologists (SLPs) are the best equipped and most competent professionals to screen, identify, diagnose, and manage individuals with literacy disorders. To tackle the challenges of and the huge demand for services in literacy as well as language and Learning_Disorders_ASDPTO, the Hong Kong Institute of Education has recently developed the Master of Science Programme in Educational Speech-Language Pathology and Learning Disabilities, which is one of the very first speech-language pathology training programmes in Asia to blend training components of learning disabilities, literacy disorders, and social-emotional-behavioural-developmental disabilities into a developmentally and medically oriented speech-language pathology training programme. This new training programme aims to prepare a new generation of SLPs to be able to offer comprehensive support to individuals with speech, language, literacy, learning, communication, and swallowing disorders of different developmental or neurogenic origins, particularly to infants and adolescents as well as to their family and educational team.

Making sense of it: a brief programme to improve reading comprehension in adolescents with Language_impairment_HP in main stream school.Children with Language_impairment_HP show academic outcomes that are consistently poorer than those of their typically developing peers. A contributor to this is difficulty with reading comprehension. Although these difficulties are reported to continue well into adolescence, this population is generally underserved with regard to therapy. The efficacy of interventions for reading comprehension is well established in the research literature, but whether the same effects are achievable within a reasonable time reflecting available resources in real-life circumstances is less clear.

Evaluation of ocular movements in patients with Dyslexia_HP.The aims of this study were to analyze the relationship between Dyslexia_HP and eye movements and to assess whether this method can be added to the workup of dyslexic patients. The sample was comprised of 11 children with a Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Dyslexia_HP and 11 normal between 8 and 13 years of age. All subjects underwent orthoptic evaluation, ophthalmological examinations, and eye movement analysis, specifically, stability analysis on fixating a still target, tracking saccades, analysis of fixation pauses, speed reading, saccades, and regressions through the reading of a text. Stability analysis on fixating a still target showed a significant (p < 0.001) difference between the two groups showing an increased amount of loss of fixation among dyslexic subjects (5.36 ± 2.5 s and 0.82 ± 2.1, respectively). Tracking saccades (Left_HP and Right_HP horizontal axis) did not show a significant difference. When reading parameters were looked into (number of saccades, number of regressions, reading time through the reading of a text), a significant (p < 0.001) difference was found between the groups. This study supports the belief that the alteration of eye movement does not depend on oculo-motor dysfunction but is secondary to a defect in the visual processing of linguistic material. Inclusion of assessment of this defect might prove beneficial in determining the presence of Dyslexia_HP in young children at a younger age, and an earlier intervention could be initiated.

Auditory short-term memory trace formation for nonspeech and speech in SLI and Dyslexia_HP as indexed by the N100 and mismatch negativity electrophysiological responses.This study investigates nonspeech and speech processing in specific Language_impairment_HP (SLI) and Dyslexia_HP. We used a passive mismatch negativity (MMN) task to tap automatic brain responses and an active behavioural task to tap attended discrimination of nonspeech and speech sounds. Using the roving standard MMN paradigm, we varied the number of standards ('few' vs. 'many') to investigate the effect of sound repetition on N100 and MMN responses. The results revealed that the SLI group needed more repetitions than dyslexics and controls to create a strong enough sensory trace to elicit MMN. In contrast, in the behavioural task, we observed good discrimination of speech and nonspeech in all groups. The findings indicate that auditory processing deficits in SLI and Dyslexia_HP are dissociable and that memory trace formation may be implicated in SLI.

Delayed Anticipatory Spoken Language Processing in Adults with Dyslexia_HP—Evidence from Eye-tracking.It is now well established that anticipation of upcoming input is a key characteristic of spoken language comprehension. It has also frequently been observed that literacy influences spoken language processing. Here, we investigated whether anticipatory spoken language processing is related to individuals' word reading abilities. Dutch adults with Dyslexia_HP and a control group participated in two eye-tracking experiments. Experiment 1 was conducted to assess whether adults with Dyslexia_HP show the typical language-mediated eye gaze patterns. Eye movements of both adults with and without Dyslexia_HP closely replicated earlier research: spoken language is used to direct attention to relevant objects in the environment in a closely time-locked manner. In Experiment 2, participants received instructions (e.g., 'Kijk naar de(COM) afgebeelde piano(COM)', look at the displayed piano) while viewing four objects. Articles (Dutch 'het' or 'de') were gender marked such that the article agreed in gender only with the target, and thus, participants could use gender information from the article to predict the target object. The adults with Dyslexia_HP anticipated the target objects but much later than the controls. Moreover, participants' word reading scores correlated positively with their anticipatory eye movements. We conclude by discussing the mechanisms by which reading abilities may influence predictive language processing.

Call for studies in implementation science: improving reading comprehension in school-age children.In this article, the Editor of Language, Speech, and Hearing Services in Schools makes the case for more studies in implementation science in order to improve the reading comprehension of school-age children, particularly those with specific Language_impairment_HP and nonspecific Language_impairment_HP.

Developmental Dyslexia_HP: predicting individual risk.Causal theories of Dyslexia_HP suggest that it is a heritable disorder, which is the outcome of multiple risk factors. However, whether early screening for Dyslexia_HP is viable is not yet known.

Reading difficulties in Spanish adults with Dyslexia_HP.Recent studies show that Dyslexia_HP persists into adulthood, even in highly educated and well-read people. The main characteristic that adults with Dyslexia_HP present is a low speed when reading. In Spanish, a shallow orthographic system, no studies about adults with Dyslexia_HP are available; and it is possible that the consistency of the orthographic system favours the reading fluency. The aim of this study was to get an insight of the reading characteristics of Spanish adults with Dyslexia_HP and also to infer the reading strategies that they are using. For that purpose, a group of 30 dyslexics (M age = 32 years old) and an age-matched group of 30 adults without reading disabilities completed several phonological and reading tasks: phonological awareness tasks, rapid automatic naming, lexical decision, word and pseudoword reading, letter detection and text reading. The results showed that highly educated Spanish dyslexics performed significantly worse than the control group in the majority of the tasks. Specifically, they showed difficulties reading long pseudowords, indicating problems in automating the grapheme-phoneme rules, but they also seem to present difficulties reading words, which indicate problems with the lexical route. It seems that the Spanish dyslexic adults, as in deep orthographies, continue having difficulties in phonological awareness tasks, rapid naming and reading.

Dyslexic children lack word selectivity gradients in occipito-temporal and inferior frontal cortex.fMRI studies using a region-of-interest approach have revealed that the ventral portion of the Left_HP occipito-temporal cortex, which is specialized for orthographic processing of visually presented words (and includes the so-called "visual word form area", VWFA), is characterized by a posterior-to-anterior gradient of increasing selectivity for words in typically reading adults, adolescents, and children (e.g. Brem et al., 2006, 2009). Similarly, the Left_HP inferior frontal cortex (IFC) has been shown to exhibit a medial-to-Lateral_HP gradient of print selectivity in typically reading adults (Vinckier et al., 2007). Functional brain imaging studies of Dyslexia_HP have reported relative underactivity in Left_HP hemisphere occipito-temporal and inferior frontal regions using whole-brain analyses during word processing tasks. Hence, the question arises whether gradient sensitivities in these regions are altered in Dyslexia_HP. Indeed, a region-of-interest analysis revealed the gradient-specific functional specialization in the occipito-temporal cortex to be disrupted in dyslexic children (van der Mark et al., 2009). Building on these studies, we here (1) investigate if a word-selective gradient exists in the inferior frontal cortex in addition to the occipito-temporal cortex in normally reading children, (2) compare typically reading with dyslexic children, and (3) examine functional connections between these regions in both groups. We replicated the previously reported anterior-to-posterior gradient of increasing selectivity for words in the Left_HP occipito-temporal cortex in typically reading children, and its absence in the dyslexic children. Our novel finding is the detection of a pattern of increasing selectivity for words along the medial-to-Lateral_HP axis of the Left_HP inferior frontal cortex in typically reading children and evidence of functional connectivity between the most Lateral_HP aspect of this area and the anterior aspects of the occipito-temporal cortex. We report absence of an IFC gradient and connectivity between the Lateral_HP aspect of the IFC and the anterior occipito-temporal cortex in the dyslexic children. Together, our results provide insights into the source of the anomalies reported in previous studies of Dyslexia_HP and add to the growing evidence of an orthographic role of IFC in reading.

Disclosing a dyslexic identity.Potential difficulties experienced by nursing students diagnosed with Dyslexia_HP can be minimised with the introduction of appropriate policies and guidance around reasonable adjustment and support. In order to access all relevant services, however, a student must actively decide to disclose their dyslexic identity to relevant faculty personnel. Disclosure of such personal information is a complex matter and, critically, requires a receptive environment where diversity and disability are embraced in a positive and meaningful way. The act of disclosure for the most part has previously been described in simplistic terms, with the focus being solely on the behaviour itself and not on the individual's own positioning of their Dyslexia_HP or the social context associated with the act. There is an onus on all students with Dyslexia_HP to self-monitor how this aspect of their identity interacts with their professional duty of care.

Clinical TVA-based studies: a general review.In combination with whole report and partial report tasks, the theory of visual attention (TVA) can be used to estimate individual differences in five basic attentional parameters: the visual processing speed, the storage capacity of visual short-term memory, the perceptual threshold, the efficiency of top-down selectivity, and the spatial bias of attentional weighting. TVA-based assessment has been used in about 30 studies to investigate attentional deficits in a range of neurological and psychiatric conditions: (a) neglect and simultanagnosia, (b) reading disturbances, (c) aging and Neurodegenerative_Diseases_ASDPTO, and most recently (d) neurodevelopmental disorders. The article introduces TVA based assessment, discusses its methodology and psychometric properties, and reviews the progress made in each of the four research fields. The empirical results demonstrate the general usefulness of TVA-based assessment for many types of clinical neuropsychological research. The method's most important qualities are cognitive specificity and theoretical grounding, but it is also characterized by good reliability and sensitivity to minor deficits. The review concludes by pointing to promising new areas for clinical TVA-based research.

The interface between genetics and psychology: lessons from developmental Dyslexia_HP.Developmental Dyslexia_HP runs in families, and twin studies have confirmed that there is a substantial genetic contribution to poor reading. The way in which discoveries in molecular genetics are reported can be misleading, encouraging us to think that there are specific genes that might be used to screen for disorder. However, Dyslexia_HP is not a classic Mendelian disorder that is caused by a mutation in a single gene. Rather, like many other common disorders, it appears to involve combined effects of many genes and environmental factors, each of which has a small influence, possibly supplemented by rare variants that have larger effects but apply to only a minority of cases. Furthermore, to see clearer relationships between genotype and phenotype, we may need to move beyond the clinical category of Dyslexia_HP to look at underlying Cognitive_impairment_HP that may be implicated in other neurodevelopmental disorders.

Impaired Statistical Learning in Developmental Dyslexia_HP.Developmental Dyslexia_HP (DD) is commonly thought to arise from phonological impairments. However, an emerging perspective is that a more general procedural learning deficit, not specific to phonological processing, may underlie DD. The current study examined if individuals with DD are capable of extracting statistical regularities across sequences of passively experienced speech and nonspeech sounds. Such statistical learning is believed to be domain-general, to draw upon procedural learning systems, and to relate to language outcomes.

Adults with Dyslexia_HP can use cues to orient and constrain attention but have a smaller and weaker attention spotlight.We report results from two experiments assessing distribution of attention and cue use in adults with Dyslexia_HP (AwD) and in a group of typically reading controls. Experiment 1 showed normal effects of cueing in AwD, with faster responses when probes were presented within a cued area and normal effects of eccentricity and stimulus Onset_HP asynchrony (SOA). In addition, AwD showed stronger benefits of a longer SOA when they had to move attention farther, and stronger effects of inclusion on the Left_HP, suggesting that cueing is particularly important in more difficult conditions. Experiment 2 tested the use of cues in a texture detection task involving a wider range of eccentricities and a shorter SOA. In this paradigm, focused attention at the Central_HP location is actually detrimental and cueing further reduces performance. Thus, if AwD have a more distributed attention, they should show a reduced performance drop at Central_HP locations and, if they do not use cues, they should show less negative effects of cueing. In contrast, AwD showed a larger drop and a positive effect of cueing. These results are better accounted for by a smaller and weaker spotlight of attention. Performance does not decrease at Central_HP locations because the attentional spotlight is already deployed with maximum Severity_HP, which cannot be further enhanced at Central_HP locations. Instead, use of cueing helps to focus limited resources. Cues orient attention to the Right_HP area without enhancing it to the point where this is detrimental for texture detection. Implications for reading are discussed.

Beyond phonological and morphological processing: pure copying as a marker of Dyslexia_HP in Chinese but not poor reading of English.To examine cognitive correlates of Dyslexia_HP in Chinese and reading difficulties in English as a foreign language, a total of 14 Chinese dyslexic children (DG), 16 poor readers of English (PE), and 17 poor readers of both Chinese and English (PB) were compared to a control sample (C) of 17 children, drawn from a statistically representative sample of 177 second graders. Children were tested on pure copying of unfamiliar stimuli, rapid automatized naming (RAN), phoneme deletion, syllable deletion, and morphological awareness. With children's ages and Raven's Absent_speech_HP Reasoning_ASDPTO statistically controlled, the PE and PB groups were significantly lower than the C group on phoneme deletion and RAN tasks, while the DG performed significantly better than the PB group on the RAN task. The copying task distinguished the DG group from the C group. Findings particularly highlight the importance of phoneme awareness for word reading in English (but not Chinese), the potential need for fluency training for children with reading difficulties in both Chinese and English, and the important role that copying skills could have specifically in understanding impairment of literacy skills in Chinese (but not English).

Polymorphisms in DCDC2 and S100B associate with developmental Dyslexia_HP.Genetic studies of complex traits have become increasingly successful as progress is made in next-generation sequencing. We aimed at discovering single nucleotide variation present in known and new candidate genes for developmental Dyslexia_HP: CYP19A1, DCDC2, DIP2A, DYX1C1, GCFC2 (also known as C2orf3), KIAA0319, MRPL19, PCNT, PRMT2, ROBO1 and S100B. We used next-generation sequencing to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the exons of these 11 genes in pools of 100 DNA samples of Finnish individuals with developmental Dyslexia_HP. Subsequent individual genotyping of those 100 individuals, and additional cases and controls from the Finnish and German populations, validated 92 out of 111 different single-nucleotide variants. A nonsynonymous polymorphism in DCDC2 (corrected P = 0.002) and a noncoding variant in S100B (corrected P = 0.016) showed a significant association with spelling performance in families of German origin. No significant association was found for the variants neither in the Finnish case-control sample set nor in the Finnish family sample set. Our findings further strengthen the role of DCDC2 and implicate S100B, in the biology of reading and spelling.

How orthographic transparency Affect_ASDPTOs morphological processing in young readers with and without Dyslexia_HP.This study investigates how orthographic modifications to the stems of complex words Affect_ASDPTO morphological processing in proficient young Spanish readers and children with reading deficits. In a definition task all children, irrespective of their reading skill, were worse at defining derived words that had an orthographic alteration of the base stem than words with no orthographic alteration. In a go/no-go lexical decision task, an interaction between base Frequency_HP and orthographic alteration was found: base Frequency_HP Affect_ASDPTOed derived words with no orthographic alteration more than words with alterations, irrespective of reading skill. Overall, results show that all children benefit from a high Frequency_HP base, skilled children outperform children with reading deficits and morphological processing is Affect_ASDPTOed by orthographic alterations similarly in proficient and impaired readers.

Syntactic comprehension and Working_Memory_ASDPTO in children with specific Language_impairment_HP, Autism_HP or Down_Syndrome_ASDPTO.This study examined syntactic assignment for predicates and reflexives as well as Working_Memory_ASDPTO effects in the sentence comprehension of children with Specific Language_impairment_HP (SLI), Down_Syndrome_ASDPTO (DS), high functioning Autism_HP (HFA) and Typical Language_Development_ASDPTO (TLD). Fifty-seven children (35 boys and 22 girls) performed a computerised picture-selection sentence comprehension task. Predicate attachment and reflexive antecedent assignment (with Working_Memory_ASDPTO manipulations) were investigated. The results showed that SLI, HFA and DS children exhibited poorer overall performance than TLD children. Children with SLI exhibited similar performance to the DS and HFA children only when Working_Memory_ASDPTO demands were higher. We conclude that children with SLI, HFA and DS differ from children with TLD in their comprehension of predicate and reflexive structures where the knowledge of syntactic assignment is required. Working_Memory_ASDPTO manipulation had different effects on syntactic comprehension depending on Language_impairment_HP. Intelligence was not an explanatory factor for the differences observed in performance.

Teaching reading to children with Neurofibromas_HP type 1: a clinical trial with random assignment to different approaches.Neurofibromas_HP type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder with a cognitive profile that includes visual-spatial perception deficits and a high incidence of Dyslexia_HP. There is a paucity of information about how this cognitively complex population responds to mainstream reading interventions. The clinical trial goals were to determine whether children and adolescents with NF1 and reading deficits (NF+RD) benefit from mainstream remedial reading programs and whether responsiveness varies with differences in program-related visual-spatial demands.

Dyslexia_HP and voxel-based morphometry: correlations between five behavioural measures of Dyslexia_HP and gray and white matter volumes.In voxel-based morphometry studies of Dyslexia_HP, the relation between causal theories of Dyslexia_HP and gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volume alterations is still under debate. Some alterations are consistently reported, but others failed to reach significance. We investigated GM alterations in a large sample of Dutch students (37 dyslexics and 57 non-dyslexics) with two analyses: group differences in local GM and total GM and WM volume and correlations between GM and WM volumes and five behavioural measures. We found no significant group differences after corrections for multiple comparisons although total WM volume was lower in the group of dyslexics when age was partialled out. We presented an overview of uncorrected clusters of voxels (p < 0.05, cluster size k > 200) with reduced or increased GM volume. We found four significant correlations between factors of Dyslexia_HP representing various behavioural measures and the clusters found in the first analysis. In the whole sample, a factor related to performances in spelling correlated negatively with GM volume in the Left_HP posterior cerebellum. Within the group of dyslexics, a factor related to performances in Dutch-English rhyme words correlated positively with GM volume in the Left_HP and Right_HP caudate nucleus and negatively with increased total WM volume. Most of our findings were in accordance with previous reports. A relatively new finding was the involvement of the caudate nucleus. We confirmed the multiple cognitive nature of Dyslexia_HP and suggested that experience greatly influences anatomical alterations depending on various subtypes of Dyslexia_HP, especially in a student sample.

The effects of orthographic transparency and familiarity on reading Hebrew words in adults with and without Dyslexia_HP.The current study examined the effects of transparency and familiarity on word recognition in adult Hebrew dyslexic readers with a phonological processing deficit as compared to typical readers. We measured oral reading response time and accuracy of single nouns in several conditions: diacritics that provide transparent but less familiar information and vowel letters that increase orthographic transparency without compromise familiarity. In line with former studies with adult dyslexics, Hebrew-speaking adults with Dyslexia_HP were significantly slower than controls. However, both dyslexic and typical readers read unpointed words faster when vowel letters were present, indicating that they may benefit from increase in orthographic transparency, when the graphemic representations are familiar. Only dyslexics read pointed words slower than unpointed words and were more sensitive to word Frequency_HP. In unpointed words, only typical readers benefitted from the reduced competition of orthographic neighbors of longer words. Results indicate that both orthographic transparency and familiarity play an important role in word recognition. Dyslexics are impaired in decoding of smaller units and are more sensitive to reduction in the familiarity of words.

Relationship of ocular accommodation and Motor_Skills_ASDPTO performance in developmental coordination disorder.Ocular accommodation provides a well-focussed image, feedback for accurate eye movement control, and cues for depth perception. To accurately perform visually guided motor tasks, integration of ocular motor systems is essential. Children with motor coordination impairment are established to be at higher risk of accommodation anomalies. The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between ocular accommodation and motor tasks, which are often overlooked, in order to better understand the problems experienced by children with motor coordination impairment. Visual function, gross and fine Motor_Skills_ASDPTO were assessed in children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) and typically developing control children. Children with DCD had significantly poorer accommodation facility and amplitude dynamics compared to controls. Results indicate a relationship between impaired accommodation and Motor_Skills_ASDPTO. Specifically, accommodation anomalies correlated with visual motor, upper limb and fine dexterity Task_Performance_ASDPTO. Consequently, we argue accommodation anomalies influence the ineffective coordination of action and perception in DCD. Furthermore, reading disabilities were related to poorer motor performance. We postulate the role of the fastigial nucleus as a common pathway for accommodation and motor deficits. Implications of the findings and recommended visual screening protocols are discussed.

Comparison of visual information processing in school-age dyslexics and normal readers via motion-Onset_HP visual evoked potentials.Standard pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials (VEPs) and motion-Onset_HP VEPs (M-VEPs) were tested in 19 dyslexics and 19 normal readers aged 7-13 years in order to evaluate the feasibility of M-VEPs for the objective diagnostics of a visual subtype of Dyslexia_HP, in which a dysfunction of the magnocellular subsystem/dorsal stream of the visual pathway is suspected. The set of VEPs consisted of the pattern-reversal VEPs with check sizes of 20', two types of translational motion (with low and high contrast) and two types of radial motion (in the full field or the periphery). While the P100 peak parameters in pattern-reversal VEPs did not differ between the group of dyslexics and controls, the group of dyslexics displayed significantly longer N2 latencies in all types of M-VEPs. Abnormal N2 latencies were found in 35-56% of dyslexics in different types of M-VEPs, with translational motion with high contrast being the most sensitive stimulation. A receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the latencies of M-VEPs displayed higher discrimination potential than M-VEPs amplitudes. The study confirms a "magnocellular pathway/dorsal stream deficit" in approximately half of dyslexics.

An assessment of gene-by-gene interactions as a tool to unfold missing heritability in Dyslexia_HP.Even if substantial heritability has been reported and candidate genes have been identified extensively, all known marker associations explain only a small proportion of the phenotypic variance of developmental Dyslexia_HP (DD) and related quantitative phenotypes. Gene-by-gene interaction (also known as "epistasis"--G × G) triggers a non-additive effect of genes at different loci and should be taken into account in explaining part of the missing heritability of this complex trait. We assessed potential G × G interactions among five DD candidate genes, i.e., DYX1C1, DCDC2, KIAA0319, ROBO1, and GRIN2B, upon DD-related neuropsychological phenotypes in 493 nuclear families with DD, by implementing two complementary regression-based approaches: (1) a general linear model equation whereby the trait is predicted by the main effect of the number of rare alleles of the two genes and by the effect of the interaction between them, and (2) a family-based association test to detect G × G interactions between two unlinked markers by splitting up the association effect into a between- and a within-family genetic orthogonal components. After applying 500,000 permutations and correcting for multiple testing, both methods show that G × G effects between markers within the DYX1C1, KIAA0319/TTRAP, and GRIN2B genes lower the memory letters composite z-score of on average 0.55 standard deviation. We provided initial evidence that the effects of familial transmission of synergistic interactions between genetic risk variants can be exploited in the study of the etiology of DD, explain part of its missing heritability, and assist in designing customized charts of individualized neurocognitive impairments in complex disorders, such as DD.

A cross-sectional study to assess the prevalence of DSM-5 specific Learning_Disorders_ASDPTO in representative school samples from the second to sixth grade in Brazil.Little is known about specific learning disorder (SLD) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and even less from representative school samples in small size cities outside huge urban centers. Few studies addressed the new DSM-5 criteria for SLDs. We investigated the prevalence of DSM-5 SLDs, their Comorbidities_ASDPTO and correlates in school samples of students from the second to sixth grades living in median cities from four different geographic regions in Brazil. A national test for academic performance covering reading, writing and mathematical abilities was applied. Psychiatric diagnoses were assessed by the K-SADS-PL applied to the primary caregiver. A total of 1618 children and adolescents were included in the study. The following prevalence rates of SLDs were found: 7.6% for global impairment, 5.4% for writing, 6.0% for arithmetic, and 7.5% for reading impairment. Attention-deficit/Hyperactivity_HP disorder (ADHD) was the only comorbidity significantly associated with SLD with global impairment (p = 0.031). Anxiety_ASDPTO_Disorders_ASDPTO and ADHD were associated with SLD with arithmetic impairment. Significant differences were detected in prevalence rates among cities, and several socio-demographic correlates (age, gender, IQ, and socioeconomic status) were significantly associated with SLD with global impairment in our sample. Careful validation and normatization of instruments to assess academic performance is a major problem in LMICs. As expected, we found a significant Heterogeneous_HP in prevalence rates of SLD according to geographic regions considering that Brazil is a country with a robust diversity. SLD with global and arithmetic impairment was significantly associated with psychiatric Comorbidities_ASDPTO.

The Visual Word Form Area remains in the dominant hemisphere for language in late-Onset_HP Left_HP occipital lobe epilepsies: A postsurgery analysis of two cases.Automatic recognition of words from letter strings is a critical processing step in reading that is lateralized to the Left_HP-hemisphere middle fusiform gyrus in the so-called Visual Word Form Area (VWFA). Surgical lesions in this location can lead to irreversible Alexia_HP. Very early Left_HP hemispheric lesions can lead to transfer of the VWFA to the nondominant hemisphere, but it is currently unknown if this capability is preserved in epilepsies developing after reading acquisition. In this study, we aimed to determine the lateralization of the VWFA in late-Onset_HP Left_HP inferior occipital lobe epilepsies and also the effect of surgical disconnection from the adjacent secondary visual areas. Two patients with Focal_HP epilepsies with Onset_HP near the VWFA underwent to surgery for Epilepsy_ASDPTO, with sparing of this area. Neuropsychology evaluations were performed before and after surgery, as well as quantitative evaluation of the speed of word reading. Comparison of the surgical localization of the lesion, with the BOLD activation associated with the contrast of words-strings, was performed, as well as a study of the associated main white fiber pathways using diffusion-weighted imaging. Neither of the patients developed Alexia_HP after surgery (similar word reading speed before and after surgery) despite the fact that the inferior occipital surgical lesions reached the neighborhood (less than 1cm) of the VWFA. Surgeries partly disconnected the VWFA from Left_HP secondary visual areas, suggesting that pathways connecting to the posterior visual ventral stream were severely Affected_HP but did not induce Alexia_HP. The anterior and superior limits of the resection suggest that the critical connection between the VWFA and the Wernicke's Angular Gyrus cortex was not Affected_HP, which is supported by the detection of this tract with probabilistic tractography. Left_HP occipital lobe epilepsies developing after reading acquisition did not produce atypical localizations of the VWFA, even with foci in the close neighborhood. Surgery for occipital lobe Epilepsy_ASDPTO should take this into consideration, as well as the fact that disconnection from the Left_HP secondary visual areas may not produce Alexia_HP.

Surgery for occipital lobe epilepsy should take this into consideration, as well as the fact that disconnection from the left secondary visual areas may not produce alexia.
Dyslexia_HP and Language_impairment_HP associated genetic markers influence cortical thickness and white matter in typically developing children.Dyslexia_HP and Language_impairment_HP (LI) are complex traits with substantial genetic components. We recently completed an association scan of the DYX2 locus, where we observed associations of markers in DCDC2, KIAA0319, ACOT13, and FAM65B with reading-, language-, and IQ-related traits. Additionally, the effects of reading-associated DYX3 markers were recently characterized using structural neuroimaging techniques. Here, we assessed the neuroimaging implications of associated DYX2 and DYX3 markers, using cortical volume, cortical thickness, and fractional anisotropy. To accomplish this, we examined eight DYX2 and three DYX3 markers in 332 subjects in the Pediatrics Imaging Neurocognition Genetics study. Imaging-genetic associations were examined by multiple linear regression, testing for influence of genotype on neuroimaging. Markers in DYX2 genes KIAA0319 and FAM65B were associated with cortical thickness in the Left_HP orbitofrontal region and global fractional anisotropy, respectively. KIAA0319 and ACOT13 were suggestively associated with overall fractional anisotropy and Left_HP pars opercularis cortical thickness, respectively. DYX3 markers showed suggestive associations with cortical thickness and volume measures in temporal regions. Notably, we did not replicate association of DYX3 markers with hippocampal measures. In summary, we performed a neuroimaging follow-up of reading-, language-, and IQ-associated DYX2 and DYX3 markers. DYX2 associations with cortical thickness may reflect variations in their role in neuronal migration. Furthermore, our findings complement gene expression and imaging studies implicating DYX3 markers in temporal regions. These studies offer insight into where and how DYX2 and DYX3 risk variants may influence neuroimaging traits. Future studies should further connect the pathways to risk variants associated with neuroimaging/neurocognitive outcomes.

Dyslexia_HP and configural perception of character sequences.Developmental Dyslexia_HP is a complex and Heterogeneous_HP disorder characterized by unexpected difficulty in learning to read. Although it is considered to be biologically based, the degree of variation has made the nature and locus of Dyslexia_HP difficult to ascertain. Hypotheses regarding the cause have ranged from low-level perceptual deficits to higher order Cognitive_impairment_HP, such as phonological processing and visual-spatial attention. We applied the capacity coefficient, a measure obtained from a mathematical cognitive model of response times to measure how efficiently participants processed different classes of stimuli. The capacity coefficient was used to test the extent to which individuals with Dyslexia_HP can be distinguished from normal reading individuals based on their ability to take advantage of word, pronounceable non-word, consonant sequence or unfamiliar context when categorizing character strings. Within subject variability of the capacity coefficient across character string types was fairly regular across normal reading adults and consistent with a previous study of word perception with the capacity coefficient-words and pseudowords were processed at super-capacity and unfamiliar characters strings at limited-capacity. Two distinct patterns were observed in individuals with Dyslexia_HP. One group had a profile similar to the normal reading adults while the other group showed very little variation in capacity across string-type. It is possible that these individuals used a similar strategy for all four string-types and were able to generalize this strategy when processing unfamiliar characters. This difference across Dyslexia_HP groups may be used to identify sub-types of the disorder and suggest significant differences in word level processing among these subtypes. Therefore, this approach may be useful in further delineating among types of Dyslexia_HP, which in turn may lead to better understanding of the etiologies of Dyslexia_HP.

Functional MRI in Medulloblastoma_HP survivors supports prophylactic reading intervention during Neoplasm_HP treatment.Development of reading skills is vulnerable to disruption in children treated for brain Neoplasm_HP. Interventions, remedial and prophylactic, are needed to mitigate reading and other learning difficulties faced by survivors. A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was conducted to investigate long-term effects of a prophylactic reading intervention administered during radiation therapy in children treated for Medulloblastoma_HP. The fMRI study included 19 reading-intervention (age 11.7 ± 0.6 years) and 21 standard-of-care (age 12.1 ± 0.6 years) Medulloblastoma_HP survivors, and 21 typically developing children (age 12.3 ± 0.6 years). The survivors were 2.5 [1.2, 5.4] years after completion of Neoplasm_HP therapies and reading-intervention survivors were 2.9 [1.6, 5.9] years after intervention. Five fMRI tasks (Rapid Automatized Naming, Continuous Performance Test using faces and letters, orthographic and phonological processing of letter pairs, implicit word reading, and story reading) were used to probe reading-related neural activation. Woodcock-Johnson Reading Fluency, Word Attack, and Sound Awareness subtests were used to evaluate reading abilities. At the time of fMRI, Sound Awareness scores were significantly higher in the reading-intervention group than in the standard-of-care group (p = 0.046). Brain activation during the fMRI tasks was detected in Left_HP inferior frontal, temporal, ventral occipitotemporal, and subcortical regions, and differed among the groups (p < 0.05, FWE). The pattern of group activation differences, across brain areas and tasks, was a normative trend in the reading-intervention group. Standardized reading scores and patterns of brain activation provide evidence of long-term effects of prophylactic reading intervention in children treated for Medulloblastoma_HP.

Clinicians with Dyslexia_HP: a systematic review of effects and strategies.For educators, an awareness of the impact of Dyslexia_HP on learners in the clinical workplace is vital: first, to be able to identify whether Dyslexia_HP may underlie certain traits and behaviours; and second, to be able to provide appropriate advice and support when Dyslexia_HP is identified. We reviewed the primary research evidence concerning the effects of Dyslexia_HP on clinicians (in or after training) in the workplace, and adaptive strategies ('workarounds') that are presently in use.

Examination of the double-deficit hypothesis with adolescents and young adults with Dyslexia_HP.The double-deficit hypothesis (DDH) of the developmental Dyslexia_HP (Wolf and Bowers, Journal of Educational Psychology, 91, 415-438, 1999) was investigated with 149 adolescents and young adults (age range = 16 to 24 years) with Dyslexia_HP. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that a two-factor model with separate naming speed (NS) and phonological awareness (PA) constructs was superior to a one-factor model, supporting the assumption within the DDH that NS is a source of reading dysfunction separable from PA. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses resulted in findings that were only partially supportive of the DDH. NS was predictive of word reading, spelling, and reading fluency beyond PA and verbal intellectual ability, but not pseudoword reading and timed and untimed reading comprehension. Examination of DDH subtypes did not support the core assumption of the DDH that the double-deficit subtype would have more impaired reading skills than both of the single-deficit subtypes. The NS deficit subtype was found to be more prevalent than the double-deficit and PA deficit subtypes within the subgroup of dyslexics with impairment in reading fluency. Overall results provided mixed support for the DDH and pointed to the need for the inclusion of additional abilities within theories of the underlying mechanisms disrupted in Dyslexia_HP.

Deficits in learning and memory in mice with a mutation of the candidate Dyslexia_HP susceptibility gene Dyx1c1.Dyslexia_HP is a learning disability characterized by difficulty learning to read and write. The underlying biological and genetic etiology remains poorly understood. One candidate gene, Dyslexia_HP susceptibility 1 candidate 1 (DYX1C1), has been shown to be associated with deficits in short-term memory in dyslexic populations. The purpose of the current study was to examine the behavioral phenotype of a mouse model with a homozygous conditional (forebrain) knockout of the rodent homolog Dyx1c1. Twelve Dyx1c1 conditional homozygous knockouts, 7 Dyx1c1 conditional heterozygous knockouts and 6 wild-type controls were behaviorally assessed. Mice with the homozygous Dyx1c1 knockout showed deficits on memory and learning, but not on auditory or motor tasks. These findings affirm existing evidence that DYX1C1 may play an underlying role in the development of neural systems important to learning and memory, and disruption of this function could contribute to the learning deficits seen in individuals with Dyslexia_HP.

Temporal resolution ability in students with Dyslexia_HP and Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO disorders.Introduction The Gaps-in-Noise (GIN) test assesses the hearing ability of temporal resolution. The development of this ability can be considered essential for learning how to read. Objective Identify temporal resolution in individuals diagnosed with Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO disorders compared with subjects with Dyslexia_HP. Methods A sample of 26 subjects of both genders, age 10 to 15 years, included 11 diagnosed with Dyslexia_HP and 15 diagnosed with Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO disorders. Subjects did not display otologic, neurologic, and/or cognitive diseases. A control group of 30 normal-hearing subjects was formed to compare thresholds and percentages obtained from the GIN test. The responses were obtained considering two measures of analysis: the threshold gap and the percentage of correct gap. Results The threshold was lower in the GIN for the typical group than for the other groups. There was no difference between groups with Dyslexia_HP and with Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO disorders. The GIN results of the typical group revealed a higher percentage of correct answer than in the other groups. No difference was obtained between the groups with Dyslexia_HP and with Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO disorders. Conclusion The GIN test identified a difficulty in auditory ability of temporal resolution in individuals with Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO disorders and in individuals with Dyslexia_HP in a similar way.

Magnetic resonance imaging findings for Dyslexia_HP: a review.Developmental Dyslexia_HP is a brain disorder that is associated with a disability to read, which affects both the behavior and the learning abilities of children. Recent advances in MRI techniques have enabled imaging of different brain structures and correlating the results to clinical findings. The goal of this paper is to cover these imaging studies in order to provide a better understanding of Dyslexia_HP and its associated brain abnormalities. In addition, this survey covers the noninvasive MRI-based diagnostics methods that can offer early detection of Dyslexia_HP. We focus on three MRI techniques: structural MRI, functional MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging. Structural MRI reveals Dyslexia_HP-associated volumetric and shape-based abnormalities in different brain structures (e.g., reduced grey matter volumes, decreased cerebral white matter gyrifications, increased corpus callosum size, and abnormal asymmetry of the cerebellum and planum temporale structures). Functional MRI reports abnormal activation patterns in Dyslexia_HP during reading operations (e.g., aggregated studies observed under-activations in the Left_HP hemisphere fusiform and supramarginal. gyri and over-activation in the Left_HP cerebellum in dyslexic subjects compared with controls). Finally, diffusion tensor imaging reveals abnormal orientations in areas within the white matter micro-structures of dyslexic brains (e.g., aggregated studies reported a reduction of the fraction anisotropy values in Bilateral_HP areas within the white matter). Herein, we will discuss all of these MRI findings focusing on various aspects of implemented methodologies, testing databases, as well as the reported findings. Finally, the paper addresses the correlation between the MRI findings in the literature, various aspects of research challenges, and future trends in this active research field.

Successful remote delivery of a treatment for phonological Alexia_HP via telerehab.A growing body of literature supports the effectiveness of the remote delivery of rehabilitation services, i.e., telerehab. Aphasia_HP treatment is particularly well suited for telerehab because of the verbal and visual nature of speech-language therapy, but scientific research investigating Aphasia_HP telerehab is in its infancy. No studies to date have evaluated whether treatment of acquired reading disorders by a live clinician can be feasibly, effectively, or efficiently conducted via telerehab. Here we address this gap in the literature by reporting our success remotely remediating the reading deficits of two participants with phonological Alexia_HP. We adapted for the telerehab setting a previously validated treatment for phonological Alexia_HP (Friedman, Sample, & Lott, 2002 ), which uses a paired-associate design to train reading of problematic words. Both telerehab participants significantly improved their reading of trained words in similar time frames as previous participants (Friedman et al., 2002 ; Kurland et al., 2008 ; Lott, Sample, Oliver, Lacey, & Friedman, 2008 ); furthermore, both participants reported high satisfaction with the telerehab setting. Although telerehab with alexic patients poses unique challenges, we conclude that treatment for Alexia_HP via telerehab is nevertheless feasible, may be equally effective as in-person treatment, and saves substantial resources for participants as well as clinicians.

Strong motion deficits in Dyslexia_HP associated with DCDC2 gene alteration.Dyslexia_HP is a specific impairment in reading that affects 1 in 10 people. Previous studies have failed to isolate a single cause of the disorder, but several candidate genes have been reported. We measured motion perception in two groups of dyslexics, with and without a deletion within the DCDC2 gene, a risk gene for Dyslexia_HP. We found impairment for motion particularly strong at high spatial frequencies in the population carrying the deletion. The data suggest that deficits in motion processing occur in a specific genotype, rather than the entire Dyslexia_HP population, contributing to the large variability in impairment of motion thresholds in Dyslexia_HP reported in the literature.

Replicability of sight word training and phonics training in poor readers: a randomised controlled trial.Given the importance of effective treatments for children with reading impairment, paired with growing concern about the lack of scientific replication in psychological science, the aim of this study was to replicate a quasi-randomised trial of sight word and phonics training using a randomised controlled trial (RCT) design. One group of poor readers (N = 41) did 8 weeks of phonics training (i.e., phonological decoding) and then 8 weeks of sight word training (i.e., whole-word recognition). A second group did the reverse order of training. Sight word and phonics training each had a large and significant valid treatment effect on trained irregular words and word reading fluency. In addition, combined sight word and phonics training had a Moderate_HP and significant valid treatment effect on nonword reading accuracy and fluency. These findings demonstrate the reliability of both phonics and sight word training in treating poor readers in an era where the importance of scientific reliability is under close scrutiny.

The Role of Metacognitive Reading Strategies, Metacognitive Study and Learning Strategies, and Behavioral Study and Learning Strategies in Predicting Academic Success in Students With and Without a History of Reading Difficulties.We examined the self-reported use of reading, study, and learning strategies in university students with a history of reading difficulties (HRD; n = 77) and with no history of reading difficulties (NRD; n = 295). We examined both between-groups differences in strategy use and strategy use as a predictive measure of academic success. Participants completed online questionnaires regarding reading history and strategy use. GPA and Frequency_HP of use of academic support services were also obtained for all students. University students with HRD reported a different profile of strategy use than their NRD peers, and self-reported strategy use was differentially predictive of GPA for students with HRD and NRD. For students with HRD, the use of metacognitive reading strategies and the use of study aids predicted academic success. Implications for university student services providers are discussed.

Breastfeeding and language outcomes: A review of the literature.Many researchers have investigated the potential impact of breastfeeding in infancy on a child's subsequent development, but only a small subset of these studies considers Language_Development_ASDPTO and impairment. This paper reviews that literature, discussing postnatal neurodevelopment, potential mechanisms for dietary influences on communication outcomes, studies of typically developing children, and studies of children with communication concerns. For population based studies of Language_Development_ASDPTO, a modest but statistically robust relationship is seen across large samples that account for breastfeeding exclusivity. A similar protective relationship is seen in studies that evaluate the relationship between breastfeeding and language disorders; effect sizes are typically larger in these papers. Implications for researchers and service providers are reviewed.

High acceptance of an early Dyslexia_HP screening test involving genetic analyses in Germany.Dyslexia_HP is a developmental disorder characterized by Severe_HP problems in the acquisition of Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO skills. It has a strong neurobiological basis. Genetic influence is estimated at 50-70%. One of the Central_HP problems with Dyslexia_HP is its late Diagnosis_ASDPTO, normally not before the end of the 2nd grade, resulting in the loss of several years for early therapy. Currently, research is focusing on the development of early tests for Dyslexia_HP, which may be based on EEG and genetics. Our aim was to determine the acceptance of such a future test among parents. We conducted a representative survey in Germany with 1000 parents of children aged 3-7 years, with and without experience of Dyslexia_HP. 88.7% of the parents supported the introduction of an early test for Dyslexia_HP based on EEG and genetics; 82.8% would have their own children tested, and 57.9% were willing to pay for the test if health insurance did not cover the costs. Test acceptance was significantly higher if parents had prior experience with Dyslexia_HP. The perceived benefits of such a test were early recognition and remediation and, preventing deficits. Concerns regarded the precision of the test, its potentially stigmatizing effect and its costs. The high overall support for the test leads to the conclusion that parents would accept a test for Dyslexia_HP based on EEG and genetics.

Dyslexic children fail to comply with the rhythmic constraints of handwriting.In this study, we sought to demonstrate that deficits in a specific motor activity, handwriting, are associated to Developmental Dyslexia_HP. The linguistic and writing performance of children with Developmental Dyslexia_HP, with and without handwriting problems (Dysgraphia_HP), were compared to that of children with Typical Development. The quantitative kinematic variables of handwriting were collected by means of a digitizing tablet. The results showed that all children with Developmental Dyslexia_HP wrote more slowly than those with Typical Development. Contrary to typically developing children, they also varied more in the time taken to write the individual letters of a word and failed to comply with the principles of isochrony and homothety. Moreover, a series of correlations was found among reading, language measures and writing measures suggesting that the two abilities may be linked. We propose that the link between handwriting and reading/language deficits is mediated by rhythm, as both reading (which is grounded on language) and handwriting are ruled by principles of rhythmic organization.

A DTI tractography study in pre-readers at risk for Dyslexia_HP.In adults and school-aged children, phonological aspects of reading seem to be sustained by Left_HP dorsal regions, while ventral regions seem to be involved in orthographic word recognition. Yet, given that the brain reorganises during reading acquisition, it is unknown when and how these reading routes emerge and whether neural deficits in Dyslexia_HP predate reading Onset_HP. Using diffusion MRI in 36 pre-readers with a family risk for Dyslexia_HP (FRD(+)) and 35 well matched pre-readers without a family risk (FRD(-)), our results show that phonological predictors of reading are sustained bilaterally by both ventral and dorsal tracts. This suggests that a dorsal and Left_HP-hemispheric specialisation for phonological aspects of reading, as observed in adults, is presumably gradually formed throughout reading development. Second, our results indicate that FRD(+) pre-readers display mainly white matter differences in Left_HP ventral tracts. This suggests that atypical white matter organisation previously found in dyslexic adults may be causal rather than resulting from a lifetime of reading difficulties, and that the location of such a deficit may vary throughout development. While this study forms an important starting point, longitudinal follow-up of these children will allow further investigation of the dynamics between emerging literacy development and white matter connections.

Reading skills, creativity, and insight: exploring the connections.Studies of the relationship between creativity and specific reading disabilities have produced inconclusive results. We explored their relationship in a sample of 259 college students (age range: 17 to 38 years-old) from three Chilean universities. The students were tested on their verbal ability, creativity, and insight. A simple linear regression was performed on the complete sample, and on high- and low-achievement groups that were formed based on reading test scores. We observed a significant correlation in the total sample between outcomes on the verbal ability tasks, and on the creativity and insight tasks (range r =. 152 to r =. 356, ps <.001). Scores on the reading comprehension and phonological awareness tasks were the best predictors of performance on creativity and insight tasks (range β = .315 to β = .155, ps <.05). A comparison of the low- and high-scoring groups on verbal ability tasks yielded results to the same effect. These findings do not support the hypothesis that specific Dyslexia_HP is associated with better performance on creative tasks. Instead, higher verbal ability was found to be associated with higher creativity and insight.

Convergent and diagnostic validity of STAVUX, a word and pseudoword spelling test for adults.Few comprehensive spelling tests are available in Swedish, and none have been validated in adults with Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO disorders. The recently developed STAVUX test includes word and pseudoword spelling subtests with high internal consistency and adult norms stratified by education. This study evaluated the convergent and diagnostic validity of STAVUX in adults with Dyslexia_HP. Forty-six adults, 23 with Dyslexia_HP and 23 controls, took STAVUX together with a standard word-decoding test and a self-rated measure of spelling skills. STAVUX subtest scores showed Moderate_HP to strong correlations with word-decoding scores and predicted self-rated spelling skills. Word and pseudoword subtest scores both predicted Dyslexia_HP status. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed excellent diagnostic discriminability. Sensitivity was 91% and specificity 96%. In conclusion, the results of this study support the convergent and diagnostic validity of STAVUX.

Academic Attainment in Students with Dyslexia_HP in Distance Education.This investigation studied attainment in students with Dyslexia_HP or other specific learning difficulties who were taking modules by distance learning with the Open University in 2012. Students with Dyslexia_HP or other specific learning difficulties who had no additional disabilities were just as likely as nondisabled students to complete their modules, but they were less likely to pass the modules that they had completed and less likely to obtain good grades on the modules that they had passed. Students with Dyslexia_HP or other specific learning difficulties who had additional disabilities were less likely to complete their modules, less likely to pass the modules that they had completed and less likely to obtain good grades on the modules that they had passed than were nondisabled students. Nevertheless, around 40% of students with Dyslexia_HP or other specific learning difficulties obtained good grades (i.e. those that would lead to a bachelor's degree with first-class or upper second-class honours).

Stress Assignment Errors in Surface Dyslexia_HP: Evidence from Two Italian Patients with a Selective Deficit of the Orthographic Input Lexicon.Surface Dyslexia_HP designates a selective impairment in reading irregular words, with spared ability to read regular and novel words, following a cerebral damage usually located in the Left_HP dominant hemisphere. In Italian language, which is regular at the segmental level, surface Dyslexia_HP is characterized by stress assignment errors. Here we report on two cases of Italian surface dyslexic patients who produced stress assignment errors, mainly in reading irregular words. In reading nonwords they usually applied the regular stress pattern. Both patients were also impaired in lexical decision and in semantic discrimination tasks when the processing of homophones was required. Our patients' performance relied almost exclusively on the phonological coding of the stimulus, revealing a deficit in accessing the orthographical input lexicon. In addition, one patient showed a cerebral lesion limited to the Right_HP thalamus, providing evidence of a possible role of the Right_HP hemisphere in the reading process.

Reading Processes and Parenting Styles.Home literacy environment explains between 12 and 18.5 % of the variance of children's language skills. Although most authors agree that children whose parents encourage them to read tend to develop better and earlier reading skills, some authors consider that the impact of family environment in reading skills is overvalued. Probably, other variables of parent-child relationship, like parenting styles, might be relevant for this field. Nevertheless, no previous studies on the effect of parenting styles in literacy have been found. To analyze the role of parenting styles in the reading processes of children. Children's perceptions of parenting styles contribute significantly to the explanation of statistical variance of children's reading processes. 110 children (67 boys and 43 girls), aged between 7 and 11 years (M [Formula: see text] 9.22 and SD [Formula: see text] 1.14) from Portuguese schools answered to a socio-demographic questionnaire. To assess reading processes it was administered the Portuguese adaptation (Figueira et al. in press) of Bateria de Avaliação dos Processos Leitores-Revista (PROLEC-R). To assess the parenting styles Egna Minnen av Barndoms Uppfostran-parents (EMBU-P) and EMBU-C (children version) were administered. According to multiple hierarchical linear regressions, individual factors contribute to explain all reading tests of PROLEC-R, while family factors contribute to explain most of these tests. Regarding parenting styles, results evidence the explanatory power about grammatical structures, sentence comprehension and listening. Parenting styles have an important role in the explanation of higher reading processes (syntactic and semantic) but not in lexical processes, focused by main theories concerning Dyslexia_HP.

The attentional blink in typically developing and reading-disabled children.This study's research question was whether selective visual attention, and specifically the attentional blink (AB) as operationalized by a dual target rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task, can explain individual differences in word reading (WR) and reading-related phonological performances in typically developing children and reading-disabled subgroups. A total of 407 Dutch school children (Grades 3-6) were classified either as typically developing (n = 302) or as belonging to one of three reading-disabled subgroups: reading disabilities only (RD-only, n = 69), both RD and attention problems (RD+ADHD, n = 16), or both RD and a specific Language_impairment_HP (RD+SLI, n = 20). The RSVP task employed alphanumeric stimuli that were presented in two blocks. Standardized Dutch tests were used to measure WR, phonemic awareness (PA), and alphanumeric rapid naming (RAN). Results indicate that, controlling for PA and RAN performance, general RSVP Task_Performance_ASDPTO contributes significant unique variance to the prediction of WR. Specifically, consistent group main effects for the parameter of AB(minimum) were found, whereas there were no AB-specific effects (i.e., AB(width) and AB(amplitude)) except for the RD+SLI group. Finally, there was a group by measurement interaction, indicating that the RD-only and comorbid groups are differentially sensitive for Prolonged_HP testing sessions. These results suggest that more general factors involved in RSVP processing may explain the group differences found.

Genetic Dyslexia_HP risk variant is related to neural connectivity patterns underlying phonological awareness in children.Phonological awareness is the best-validated predictor of reading and spelling skill and therefore highly relevant for developmental Dyslexia_HP. Prior imaging genetics studies link several Dyslexia_HP risk genes to either brain-functional or brain-structural factors of phonological deficits. However, coherent evidence for genetic associations with both functional and structural neural phenotypes underlying variation in phonological awareness has not yet been provided. Here we demonstrate that rs11100040, a reported modifier of SLC2A3, is related to the functional connectivity of Left_HP fronto-temporal phonological processing areas at resting state in a sample of 9- to 12-year-old children. Furthermore, we provide evidence that rs11100040 is related to the fractional anisotropy of the arcuate fasciculus, which forms the structural connection between these areas. This structural connectivity phenotype is associated with phonological awareness, which is in turn associated with the individual retrospective risk scores in an early Dyslexia_HP screening as well as to spelling. These results suggest a link between a Dyslexia_HP risk genotype and a functional as well as a structural neural phenotype, which is associated with a phonological awareness phenotype. The present study goes beyond previous work by integrating genetic, brain-functional and brain-structural aspects of phonological awareness within a single approach. These combined findings might be another step towards a multimodal biomarker for developmental Dyslexia_HP.

Morphological differences in the Lateral_HP geniculate nucleus associated with Dyslexia_HP.Developmental Dyslexia_HP is a common learning disability characterized by normal intelligence but difficulty in skills associated with reading, writing and spelling. One of the most prominent, albeit controversial, theories of Dyslexia_HP is the magnocellular theory, which suggests that malfunction of the magnocellular system in the brain is responsible for the behavioral deficits. We sought to test the basis of this theory by directly measuring the Lateral_HP geniculate nucleus (LGN), the only location in the brain where the magnocellular and parvocellular streams are spatially disjoint. Using high-resolution proton-density weighted MRI scans, we precisely measured the anatomical boundaries of the LGN in 13 subjects with Dyslexia_HP (five female) and 13 controls (three female), all 22-26 years old. The Left_HP LGN was significantly smaller in volume in subjects with Dyslexia_HP and also differed in shape; no differences were observed in the Right_HP LGN. The functional significance of this asymmetry is unknown, but these results are consistent with the magnocellular theory and support theories of Dyslexia_HP that involve differences in the early visual system.

One of the most prominent, albeit controversial, theories of dyslexia is the magnocellular theory, which suggests that malfunction of the magnocellular system in the brain is responsible for the behavioral deficits. We sought to test the basis of this theory by directly measuring the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), the only location in the brain where the magnocellular and parvocellular streams are spatially disjoint. Using high-resolution proton-density weighted MRI scans, we precisely measured the anatomical boundaries of the LGN in 13 subjects with dyslexia (five female) and 13 controls (three female), all 22-26 years old. The left LGN was significantly smaller in volume in subjects with dyslexia and also differed in shape; no differences were observed in the right LGN. The functional significance of this asymmetry is unknown, but these results are consistent with the magnocellular theory and support theories of dyslexia that involve differences in the early visual system.
Neural Mechanisms Underlying Musical Pitch Perception and Clinical Applications Including Developmental Dyslexia_HP.Music production and perception invoke a complex set of cognitive functions that rely on the integration of sensorimotor, cognitive, and emotional pathways. Pitch is a fundamental perceptual attribute of sound and a building block for both music and speech. Although the cerebral processing of pitch is not completely understood, recent advances in imaging and electrophysiology have provided insight into the functional and anatomical pathways of pitch processing. This review examines the current understanding of pitch processing and behavioral and neural variations that give rise to difficulties in pitch processing, and potential applications of music education for language processing disorders such as Dyslexia_HP.

Informational masking of speech in dyslexic children.Studies evaluating speech perception in noise have reported inconsistent results regarding a potential deficit in dyslexic children. So far, most of them investigated energetic masking. The present study evaluated situations inducing mostly informational masking, which reflects cognitive interference induced by the masker. Dyslexic children were asked to identify a female target syllable presented in quiet, babble, unmodulated, and modulated speech-shaped noise. Whereas their performance was comparable to normal-reading children in quiet, it dropped significantly in all noisy conditions compared to age-, but not reading level-matched controls. Interestingly, noise Affected_HP similarly the reception of voicing, place, and manner of articulation in dyslexic and normal-reading children.

[The comorbidity of learning difficulties and ADHD symptoms in primary-school-age children].Children having difficulties in acquiring early literacy and mathematical skills often show an increased rate of inattention, Hyperactivity_HP, and Impulsivity_HP. This study provides data on the comorbidity rates of specific learning difficulties and ADHD symptoms. We analyzed the data of 273 children with learning difficulties despite an at least average IQ, 57 children with low IQ, and 270 children without learning difficulties and average IQ (comparison group). We assessed children’s IQ and school achievement using standardized achievement tests. ADHD symptoms were assessed via parents’ ratings. Our results showed that only 5 % of both the control group and the group with solely mathematical difficulties fulfilled the criteria of an ADHD subtype according to the DSM-IV based on parents’ ratings. In contrast, this was the case in even 20 % of the children with difficulties in reading/writing and of those with low IQ. Compared to girls, boys in the control group had a 150% higher risk for matching the criteria of one of the ADHD subtypes in parents’ ratings, whereas boys with learning difficulties and those with low IQ had an even 200% to 600% higher risk for it. The relationship between learning difficulties and ADHD symptoms can be found predominantly in the inattentive type. Possible reasons for the results are discussed.

Contrasting brain patterns of writing-related DTI parameters, fMRI connectivity, and DTI-fMRI connectivity correlations in children with and without Dysgraphia_HP or Dyslexia_HP.Based on comprehensive testing and educational history, children in grades 4-9 (on average 12 years) were diagnosed with Dysgraphia_HP (persisting handwriting impairment) or Dyslexia_HP (persisting word spelling/reading impairment) or as typical writers and readers (controls). The Dysgraphia_HP group (n = 14) and Dyslexia_HP group (n = 17) were each compared to the control group (n = 9) and to each other in separate analyses. Four brain region seed points (Left_HP occipital temporal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, precuneus, and inferior frontal gyrus) were used in these analyses which were shown in a metaanalysis to be related to written word production on four indicators of white matter integrity and fMRI functional connectivity for four tasks (self-guided mind wandering during resting state, writing letter that follows a visually displayed letter in alphabet, writing missing letter to create a correctly spelled real word, and Planning_ASDPTO for composing after scanning on topic specified by researcher). For those DTI indicators on which the dysgraphic group or dyslexic group differed from the control group (fractional anisotropy, relative anisotropy, Axial_HP diffusivity but not radial diffusivity), correlations were computed between the DTI parameter and fMRI functional connectivity for the two writing tasks (alphabet and spelling) by seed points. Analyses, controlled for multiple comparisons, showed that (a) the control group exhibited more white matter integrity than either the dysgraphic or dyslexic group; (b) the dysgraphic and dyslexic groups showed more functional connectivity than the control group but differed in patterns of functional connectivity for task and seed point; and (c) the dysgraphic and dyslexic groups showed different patterns of significant DTI-fMRI connectivity correlations for specific seed points and written language tasks. Thus, Dysgraphia_HP and Dyslexia_HP differ in white matter integrity, fMRI functional connectivity, and white matter-gray matter correlations. Of clinical relevance, brain differences were observed in Dysgraphia_HP and Dyslexia_HP on written language tasks yoked to their defining behavioral impairments in handwriting and/or in word spelling and on the cognitive mind wandering rest condition and composition Planning_ASDPTO.

The Effect of Training on Postural Control in Dyslexic Children.The aim of this study was to explore whether a short postural training period could Affect_ASDPTO postural stability in dyslexic children. Postural performances were evaluated using Multitest Equilibre from Framiral. Posture was recorded in three different viewing conditions (eyes open fixating a target, eyes closed and eyes open with perturbed vision) and in two different postural conditions (on Stable_HP and unStable_HP support). Two groups of dyslexic children participated in the study, i.e. G1: 16 dyslexic participants (mean age 9.9 ± 0.3 years) who performed short postural training and G2: 16 dyslexic participants of similar ages (mean age 9.1 ± 0.3 years) who did not perform any short postural training. Findings showed that short postural training improved postural stability on unStable_HP support surfaces with perturbed vision: indeed the surface, the mean velocity of CoP and the spectral power indices in both directions decreased significantly, and the cancelling time in the antero-posterior direction improved significantly. Such improvement could be due to brain plasticity, which allows better performance in sensory process and cerebellar integration.

A Novel Pupillometric Method for Indexing   Word Difficulty in Individuals With   and Without Aphasia_HP.Cognitive effort is a clinically important facet of linguistic processing that is often overlooked in the assessment and treatment of people with Aphasia_HP (PWA). Furthermore, there is a paucity of valid ways to index cognitive effort in PWA. The construct of cognitive effort has been indexed for decades via pupillometry (measurement of pupil dilation and constriction during a cognitive task), yet pupillometry has not been implemented in studies including PWA. In the present study, we tested a novel method for indexing cognitive effort during linguistic processing in people with and without Aphasia_HP.

Linking memory and language: Evidence for a serial-order learning impairment in Dyslexia_HP.The present study investigated long-term serial-order learning impairments, operationalized as reduced Hebb repetition learning (HRL), in people with Dyslexia_HP. In a first multi-session experiment, we investigated both the persistence of a serial-order learning impairment as well as the long-term retention of serial-order representations, both in a group of Dutch-speaking adults with developmental Dyslexia_HP and in a matched control group. In a second experiment, we relied on the assumption that HRL mimics naturalistic word-form acquisition and we investigated the lexicalization of novel word-forms acquired through HRL. First, our results demonstrate that adults with Dyslexia_HP are fundamentally impaired in the long-term acquisition of serial-order information. Second, dyslexic and control participants show comparable retention of the long-term serial-order representations in memory over a period of 1 month. Third, the data suggest weaker lexicalization of newly acquired word-forms in the dyslexic group. We discuss the integration of these findings into current theoretical views of Dyslexia_HP.

Confusing confusability: on the problems of using psychophysical measures of letter confusability in neuropsychological research.The effect of letter confusability on reading has received increasing attention over the last decade. Confusability scores for individual letters, derived from older psychophysical studies, have been used to calculate summed confusability scores for whole words, and effects of this variable on normal and alexic reading have been reported. On this basis, letter confusability is now increasingly controlled for in stimulus selection. In this commentary, we try to clarify what letter confusability scores represent and discuss several problems with the way this variable has been treated in neuropsychological research. We conclude that it is premature to control for this variable when selecting stimuli in studies of reading and Alexia_HP. Although letter confusability may play a role in (impaired) reading, it remains to be determined how this measure should be calculated, and what effect it may have on word and letter identification.

The Roles of Genes in the Neuronal Migration and Neurite Outgrowth Network in Developmental Dyslexia_HP: Single- and Multiple-Risk Genetic Variants.Abnormal regulation of neural migration and neurite growth is thought to be an important feature of developmental Dyslexia_HP (DD). We investigated 16 genetic variants, selected by bioinformatics analyses, in six key genes in the neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth network in a Chinese population. We first observed that KIAA0319L rs28366021, KIAA0319 rs4504469, and DOCK4 rs2074130 were significantly associated with DD risk after false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment for multiple comparisons (odds ratio (OR) = 0.672, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0.505-0.894, P = 0.006; OR = 1.608, 95 % CI = 1.174-2.203, P = 0.003; OR = 1.681, 95 % CI = 1.203-2.348, P = 0.002). The following classification and regression tree (CART) analysis revealed a prediction value of gene-gene interactions among DOCK4 rs2074130, KIAA0319 rs4504469, DCDC2 rs2274305, and KIAA0319L rs28366021 variants. Compared with the lowest risk carriers of the combination of rs2074130 CC, rs4504469 CC, and rs2274305 GG genotype, individuals carrying the combined genotypes of rs2074130 CC, rs4504469 CT or TT, and rs28366021 GG had a significantly increased risk for DD (OR = 2.492, 95 % CI = 1.447-4.290, P = 0.001); individuals with the combination of rs2074130 CT or TT and rs28366021 GG genotype exhibited the highest risk for DD (OR = 2.770, 95 % CI = 2.265-6.276, P = 0.000). A significant dose effect was observed among these four variants (P for trend = 0.000). In summary, this study supports the importance of single- and multiple-risk variants in this network in DD susceptibility in China.

On the use of spatial Frequency_HP to isolate contributions from the magnocellular and parvocellular systems and the dorsal and ventral cortical streams.Many authors have claimed that suprathreshold achromatic stimuli of low and high spatial Frequency_HP can be used to separate responses from different entities in the visual system. Most prominently, it has been proposed that such stimuli can differentiate responses from the magnocellular and parvocellular systems. As is reviewed here, investigators who have examined stimulus specificity of neurons in these systems have found little difference between magno- and parvocellular cells. It has also been proposed that spatial Frequency_HP can be used to selectively activate the "magnocellular-dorsal stream". The present review indicates that cells in Area MT of the dorsal stream do prefer very low spatial frequencies. However, the review also shows that cells in Area V4 of the ventral stream respond, not only to relatively high spatial frequencies, but also to low Frequency_HP stimuli. Thus, low spatial frequencies cannot be relied upon to selectively activate the dorsal stream.

Neural dysfunction in ADHD with Dyslexia_HP during a word rhyming Continuous Performance Task.Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity_HP Disorder (ADHD) is a Heterogeneous_HP, neurodevelopmental disorder which co-occurs often with Dyslexia_HP (RD). ADHD with and without RD consistently have higher inattentive ratings compared with typically developing controls, with co-occurring ADHD and RD also demonstrating impaired phonological processing. Accordingly, inattention has been associated with greater phonological impairment, though the neural correlates of the association are poorly understood from a functional neuroimaging perspective. It was postulated that only the co-occurring subgroup would demonstrate hypoactivation of posterior, Left_HP hemispheric, reading-related areas and, to a lesser extent, alterations in Right_HP hemispheric, attention areas compared with controls.

ADHD with and without RD consistently have higher inattentive ratings compared with typically developing controls, with co-occurring ADHD and RD also demonstrating impaired phonological processing. Accordingly, inattention has been associated with greater phonological impairment, though the neural correlates of the association are poorly understood from a functional neuroimaging perspective. It was postulated that only the co-occurring subgroup would demonstrate hypoactivation of posterior, left hemispheric, reading-related areas and, to a lesser extent, alterations in right hemispheric, attention areas compared with controls.

[The importance of early Diagnosis_ASDPTO and intervention in children diagnosed with reading disorder. Case studies].Reading Disorder (RD) belongs to Specific Learning_Disorders_ASDPTO within the chapter of Neurodevelopmental Disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of Mental_Disorders_ASDPTO 5th edition. Previous research shows that the time of the Diagnosis_ASDPTO of RD - early (before starting school) or late - has a great impact on the prognosis. In the current paper we present the cases of two children diagnosed with RD. Our cases demonstrate that if RD is diagnosed in early childhood, the child's and his/her family's quality of life can be influenced in a positive direction, while late recognition of RD might influence the child's and the family's quality of life negatively. For these reasons it is important that experts recognize RD in time, start appropriate treatment and give proper support to children diagnosed with RD and their families.

Increased Resting-State Functional Connectivity in the Cingulo-Opercular Cognitive-Control Network after Intervention in Children with Reading Difficulties.Dyslexia_HP, or reading difficulty, is characterized by slow, inaccurate reading accompanied by executive dysfunction. Reading training using the Reading Acceleration Program improves reading and executive functions in both children with Dyslexia_HP and typical readers. This improvement is associated with increased activation in and functional connectivity between the anterior cingulate cortex, part of the cingulo-opercular cognitive-control network, and the fusiform gyrus during a reading task after training. The objective of the current study was to determine whether the training also has an effect on functional connectivity of the cingulo-opercular and fronto-parietal cognitive-control networks during rest in children with Dyslexia_HP and typical readers. Fifteen children with reading difficulty and 17 typical readers (8-12 years old) were included in the study. Reading and executive functions behavioral measures and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected before and after reading training. Imaging data were analyzed using a graphical network-modeling tool. Both reading groups had increased reading and executive-functions scores after training, with greater gains among the Dyslexia_HP group. Training may have less effect on cognitive control in typical readers and a more direct effect on the visual area, as previously reported. Statistical analysis revealed that compared to typical readers, children with reading difficulty had significantly greater functional connectivity in the cingulo-opercular network after training, which may demonstrate the importance of cognitive control during reading in this population. These results support previous findings of increased error-monitoring activation after reading training in children with Dyslexia_HP and confirm greater gains with training in this group.

Increased resting-state functional connectivity of visual- and cognitive-control brain networks after training in children with reading difficulties.The Reading Acceleration Program, a computerized reading-training program, increases activation in neural circuits related to reading. We examined the effect of the training on the functional connectivity between independent components related to visual processing, Executive_Function_ASDPTOs, attention, memory, and language during rest after the training. Children 8-12 years old with reading difficulties and typical readers participated in the study. Behavioral testing and functional magnetic resonance imaging were performed before and after the training. Imaging data were analyzed using an independent component analysis approach. After training, both reading groups showed increased single-word contextual reading and reading comprehension scores. Greater positive correlations between the visual-processing component and the Executive_Function_ASDPTOs, attention, memory, or language components were found after training in children with reading difficulties. Training-related increases in connectivity between the visual and attention components and between the visual and Executive_Function_ASDPTO components were positively correlated with increased word reading and reading comprehension, respectively. Our findings suggest that the effect of the Reading Acceleration Program on basic cognitive domains can be detected even in the absence of an ongoing reading task.

[The prospects of the future study and medical practice].It is thought that Dyslexia_HP is caused by brain dysfunction--specifically, impairment of phonological processing. Dyslexia_HP is classified into neurodevelopmental disorder in DSM-5 and is described as an alternative term for specific learning disorder that includes reading impairment. It seems that Dyslexia_HP will be recognized as a separate clinical entity. As in our country, clinical research for Diagnosis_ASDPTO and treatment is continually progressing. Our original reading aloud test is recognized as an official examination for Dyslexia_HP Diagnosis_ASDPTO and is indicated as a mark of the fee-for-service. The time has come when we must regard this disorder not only as a special needs education issue but also as a medical subject.

Brazilian Portuguese adaptation of Dyslexia_HP Early Screening Test - Second edition: preliminary findings.The assessment of language skills in early childhood can provide important information about the future of literacy and academic performances. Children with reading difficulties should be identified early in their education, before they suffer from shortcomings and experience failures and feel discouraged at school. Considering the importance of early identification of language disorders and the shortage of standardized instruments for the Brazilian scenario, the overall objective of this study was to translate and adapt the Dyslexia_HP Early Screening Test - Second Edition (DEST-2) to, subsequently, verify its applicability and efficacy in preschoolers who had Brazilian Portuguese as their native language. The study was composed of 20 children of both genders, regularly enrolled in a public school in the metropolitan region of São Paulo, none had any complaints related to learning and no indicators of sensory, neurological, cognitive, or Behavioral_abnormality_HP. It was observed that there was no need for significant changes to the original structure of the DEST-2 or in their administration instructions format. The performance of the children in the translated and in the national exams that were used as a benchmark was compatible, suggesting that the adjustments made met the equivalences needed to utilize this instrument with Brazilian children. A randomized study that will complement the preliminarily data obtained is in progress. Taking into consideration the linguistic and cultural diversity of Brazil, it is imperative that the translated version of the DEST-2 can be applied on a large scale and in several states of the country, in order to allow the use of this instrument as a language assessment tool in Brazil.

Metacognition and Reading: Comparing Three Forms of Metacognition in Normally Developing Readers and Readers with Dyslexia_HP.Metacognition refers to 'cognition about cognition' and includes metacognitive knowledge, strategies and experiences (Efklides, 2008; Flavell, 1979). Research on reading has shown that better readers demonstrate more metacognitive knowledge than poor readers (Baker & Beall, 2009), and that reading ability improves through strategy instruction (Gersten, Fuchs, Williams, & Baker, 2001). The current study is the first to specifically compare the three forms of metacognition in dyslexic (N = 22) versus normally developing readers (N = 22). Participants read two factual texts, with learning outcome measured by a memory task. Metacognitive knowledge and skills were assessed by self-report. Metacognitive experiences were measured by predictions of performance and judgments of learning. Individuals with Dyslexia_HP showed insight into their reading problems, but less general knowledge of how to approach text reading. They more often reported lack of available reading strategies, but groups did not differ in the use of deep and surface strategies. Learning outcome and mean ratings of predictions of performance and judgments of learning were lower in dyslexic readers, but not the accuracy with which metacognitive experiences predicted learning. Overall, the results indicate that dyslexic reading and spelling problems are not generally associated with lower levels of metacognitive knowledge, metacognitive strategies or sensitivity to metacognitive experiences in reading situations.

Procedural learning and automatization process in children with developmental coordination disorder and/or developmental Dyslexia_HP.There is increasing evidence to suggest that developmental Dyslexia_HP (DD) and developmental coordination disorder (DCD) actually form part of a broader disorder. Their Frequent_HP association could be justified by a deficit of the procedural memory system, that subtends many of the cognitive, motor and linguistic abilities that are impaired in both DD and DCD. However, studies of procedural learning in these two disorders have yielded divergent results, and in any case no studies have so far addressed the issue of automatization (dual-task paradigm).

In search of methods enhancing fluency in reading: An examination of the relations between time constraints and processes of reading in readers of German.The attainment of fluency in reading is a major difficulty for reading-disabled people. Manipulations applied on the presentation of texts, leading to "on-line" effects on reading (i.e., while texts are manipulated), are one direction of examinations in search of methods affecting reading. The imposing of time constraints, by deleting one letter after the other from texts presented on a computer screen, has been established as such a method. In an attempt to further understand its nature, we tested the relations between time constraints and processes of reading: phonological decoding of small orthogrpahic units and the addressing of orthographic representations from the mental lexicon. We also examined whether the type of orthogrpahic unit deleted (lexical, sublexical, or nonlexical unit) has any additional effect. Participants were German fifth graders with (n = 29) or without (n = 34) Dyslexia_HP. Time constraints enhanced fluency in reading in both groups, and to a similar extent, across conditions. Comprehension was unimpaired. These results place the very principle of time constraints, regardless of the orthographic unit manipulated, as a critical factor affecting fluency in reading. However, phonological decoding explained a significant amount of variance in fluency in reading across all conditions in reading-disabled children, whereas the addressing of orthographic representations was the consistent predictor of fluency in reading in regular readers. These results indicate a qualitative difference in the processes explaining the variance in fluency in reading in regular and reading-disabled readers and suggest that time constraints might not have an effect on the relations between these processes and reading performance.

Reading impairment in Duchenne Muscular_dystrophy_HP: A pilot study to investigate similarities and differences with developmental Dyslexia_HP.Below-average reading performances have been reported in individuals with Duchenne Muscular_dystrophy_HP (DMD), but literacy problems in these subjects have yet to be characterized. In this study, the presence and characteristics of literacy deficits in boys with DMD were investigated through a comparison with typically developing children and with children Affected_HP by developmental Dyslexia_HP, with the aim of clarifying whether DMD and developmental Dyslexia_HP have overlapping profiles of literacy deficits and whether these deficits are associated, as in children with Dyslexia_HP, with impairments in phonological processing and rapid lexical access. The results confirmed the high incidence of literacy problems in boys with DMD and revealed a profile less Severe_HP than, but qualitatively similar to, that of Italian children with developmental Dyslexia_HP. Both groups showed specific difficulties in Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO words and a reduced rapid automatized naming (RAN) speed. This is the first time that a RAN speed deficit has been documented in DMD. Moreover, the boys with DMD and the subgroup of dyslexic children with a previous Delayed_speech_and_language_development_HP showed additional deficits in phonological processing. The impairments highlighted in this study could explain the reading difficulties observed in boys with DMD and suggest that there is a need for targeted preschool interventions.

Risk and protective factors in gifted children with Dyslexia_HP.This study investigated risk and protective factors associated with Dyslexia_HP and literacy development, both at the group and individual level, to gain more insight in underlying cognitive profiles and possibilities for compensation in high-IQ children. A sample of 73 Dutch primary school children included a dyslexic group, a gifted-dyslexic group, and a Borderline_HP-dyslexic group (i.e., gifted children with relative literacy problems). Children were assessed on literacy, phonology, language, and Working_Memory_ASDPTO. Competing hypotheses were formulated, comparing the core-deficit view to the twice-exceptionality view on compensation with giftedness-related strengths. The results showed no indication of compensation of Dyslexia_HP-related deficits by giftedness-related strengths in gifted children with Dyslexia_HP. The higher literacy levels of Borderline_HP children compared to gifted children with Dyslexia_HP seemed the result of both fewer combinations of risk factors and less Severe_HP phonological deficits in this group. There was no evidence for compensation by specific strengths more relevant to literacy development in the Borderline_HP group. Accordingly, the findings largely supported the core-deficit view, whereas no evidence for the twice-exceptionality view was found. Besides practical implications, the findings also add to knowledge about the different manifestations of Dyslexia_HP and associated underlying cognitive factors at the higher end of the intelligence spectrum.

Reading under the skin: physiological activation during reading in children with Dyslexia_HP and typical readers.The aim of this study was to investigate physiological activation during reading and control tasks in children with Dyslexia_HP and typical readers. Skin conductance response (SCR) recorded during four tasks involving reading aloud, reading silently, and describing illustrated stories aloud and silently was compared for children with Dyslexia_HP (n = 16) and a control group of typical readers (n = 16). Children's school wellness was measured through self- and parent-proxy reports. Significantly lower SCR was found for dyslexic children in the reading-aloud task, compared to the control group, whereas all participants showed similar physiological reactions to the other experimental conditions. SCR registered during reading tasks correlated with "Child's emotional difficulties," as reported by parents. Possible interpretations of the lower activation during reading aloud in dyslexic children are discussed.

Impaired functional differentiation for categories of objects in the ventral visual stream: A case of developmental Visual_impairment_HP.We report the case of a 14-year-old girl suffering from Severe_HP developmental Visual_impairment_HP along with delayed language and cognitive development, and featuring a clear-cut dissociation between spared dorsal and impaired ventral visual pathways. Visual recognition of objects, including faces and printed words, was Affected_HP. In contrast, movement perception and visually guided motor control were preserved. Structural MRI was normal on inspection, but Voxel Based Morphometry (VBM) revealed reduced grey matter density in the mesial occipital and ventral occipito-temporal cortex. Functional MRI during the perception of line drawings uncovered impaired differentiation which is normally observed at even younger ages: no local category preferences could be identified within the occipito-temporal cortex for faces, houses, words or tools. In contrast, movement-related activations appeared to be normal. Finally, those abnormalities evolved on the background of Chronic_HP Bilateral_HP occipital epileptic activity, including continuous spike-wave discharges during sleep, which may be considered as the primary cause of non-specific Intellectual_disability_HP and Visual_impairment_HP.

Acquired spatial Dyslexia_HP.Acquired spatial Dyslexia_HP is a reading disorder Frequent_HPly occurring after Left_HP or Right_HP posterior brain lesions. This article describes several types of spatial Dyslexia_HP with an attentional approach. After Right_HP posterior lesions, patients show Left_HP neglect Dyslexia_HP with errors on the Left_HP side of text, words, and non-words. The deficit is Frequent_HPly associated with Left_HP Unilateral_HP spatial neglect. Severe_HP Left_HP neglect Dyslexia_HP can be detected with unlimited exposure duration of words or non-words. Minor neglect Dyslexia_HP is detected with brief presentation of Bilateral_HP words, one in the Left_HP and one in the Right_HP visual field (phenomenon of contralesional extinction). Neglect Dyslexia_HP can be explained as a difficulty in orienting attention to the Left_HP side of verbal stimuli. With Left_HP posterior lesions, spatial Dyslexia_HP is also Frequent_HP but multiform. Right_HP neglect Dyslexia_HP is Frequent_HP, but Right_HP Unilateral_HP spatial neglect is rare. Attentional Dyslexia_HP represents difficulty in selecting a stimulus, letter or word among other similar stimuli; it is a deficit of attentional selection, and the Left_HP hemisphere plays a crucial role in selection. Two other types of spatial Dyslexia_HP can be found after Left_HP posterior lesions: paradoxical ipsilesional extinction and stimulus-centred neglect Dyslexia_HP. Disconnections between Left_HP or Right_HP parietal attentional areas and the Left_HP temporal visual word form area could explain these deficits. Overall, a model of attention dissociating modulation, selection control, and selection positioning can help in understanding these reading disorders.
Acquired spatial dyslexia.Acquired spatial dyslexia is a reading disorder frequently occurring after left or right posterior brain lesions. This article describes several types of spatial dyslexia with an attentional approach. After right posterior lesions, patients show left neglect dyslexia with errors on the left side of text, words, and non-words. The deficit is frequently associated with left unilateral spatial neglect. Severe_HP left neglect dyslexia can be detected with unlimited exposure duration of words or non-words. Minor neglect dyslexia is detected with brief presentation of bilateral words, one in the left and one in the right visual field (phenomenon of contralesional extinction). Neglect dyslexia can be explained as a difficulty in orienting attention to the left side of verbal stimuli. With left posterior lesions, spatial dyslexia is also frequent but multiform.

Knowledge and beliefs about developmental Dyslexia_HP in pre-service and in-service Spanish-speaking teachers.The present study investigated knowledge, misconceptions, and lack of information about Dyslexia_HP among pre-service (PST) and in-service (IST) Spanish-speaking teachers in Spain and Peru. Two hundred and forty-six pre-service teachers and 267 in-service teachers completed the Knowledge and Beliefs about Developmental Dyslexia_HP Scale (KBDDS). In-service teachers scored significantly higher on the total scale, and on the symptoms/Diagnosis_ASDPTO and general information subscales, than pre-service teachers. The percentages for misconceptions and lack of information ("do not know responses") were higher for PSTs than for ISTs on the general information subscale, the symptoms/Diagnosis_ASDPTO subscale, and the treatment subscale. Analyses of individual items were conducted to differentiate concepts that teachers did not know from misconceptions. In-service teacher self-efficacy, years of teaching experience, post-graduate training in Dyslexia_HP, and prior exposure to a child with Dyslexia_HP were positively related to knowledge about Dyslexia_HP. Implications for pre-service teacher training and professional development are discussed.

Thinking outside the boxes: Using current reading models to assess and treat developmental surface Dyslexia_HP.Improving the reading performance of children with developmental surface Dyslexia_HP has proved challenging, with limited generalisation of reading skills typically reported after intervention. The aim of this study was to provide tailored, theoretically motivated intervention to two children with developmental surface Dyslexia_HP. Our objectives were to improve their reading performance, and to evaluate the utility of current reading models in therapeutic practice. Detailed reading and cognitive profiles for two male children with developmental surface Dyslexia_HP were compared to the results obtained by age-matched control groups. The specific area of single-word reading difficulty for each child was identified within the dual route model (DRM) of reading, following which a theoretically motivated intervention programme was devised. Both children showed significant improvements in single-word reading ability after training, with generalisation effects observed for untrained words. However, the assessment and intervention results also differed for each child, reinforcing the view that the causes and consequences of developmental Dyslexia_HP, even within subtypes, are not homogeneous. Overall, the results of the interventions corresponded more closely with the DRM than other current reading models, in that real word reading improved in the absence of enhanced nonword reading for both children.

Working-memory endophenotype and Dyslexia_HP-associated genetic variant predict Dyslexia_HP phenotype.Developmental Dyslexia_HP, a Severe_HP impairment of literacy acquisition, is known to have a neurological basis and a strong genetic background. However, effects of individual genetic variations on Dyslexia_HP-associated deficits are only Moderate_HP and call for the assessment of the genotype's impact on mediating neuro-endophenotypes by the imaging genetics approach. Using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in German participants with and without Dyslexia_HP, we investigated gray matter changes and their association with impaired phonological processing, such as reduced verbal Working_Memory_ASDPTO. These endophenotypical alterations were, together with Dyslexia_HP-associated genetic variations, examined on their suitability as potential predictors of Dyslexia_HP. We identified two gray matter clusters in the Left_HP posterior temporal cortex related to verbal Working_Memory_ASDPTO capacity. Regional cluster differences correlated with genetic risk variants in TNFRSF1B. High-genetic-risk participants exhibit a structural predominance of auditory-association areas relative to auditory-sensory areas, which may partly compensate for deficient early auditory-sensory processing stages of verbal Working_Memory_ASDPTO. The reverse regional predominance observed in low-genetic-risk participants may in turn reflect reliance on these early auditory-sensory processing stages. Logistic regression analysis further supported that regional gray matter differences and genetic risk interact in the prediction of individuals' diagnostic status: With increasing genetic risk, the working-memory related structural predominance of auditory-association areas relative to auditory-sensory areas classifies participants with Dyslexia_HP versus control participants. Focusing on phonological deficits in Dyslexia_HP, our findings suggest endophenotypical changes in the Left_HP posterior temporal cortex could comprise novel pathomechanisms for verbal Working_Memory_ASDPTO-related processes translating TNFRSF1B genotype into the Dyslexia_HP phenotype.

Developmental Dyslexia_HP With and Without Language_impairment_HP: ERPs Reveal Qualitative Differences in Morphosyntactic Processing.This study aimed to characterize neuropsychological and linguistic skills in children with Developmental Dyslexia_HP (DD) with and without Language_impairment_HP (LI). Behavioral tests of short-term memory, phonemic awareness, and morphosyntactic processing and electrophysiological responses to agreement violations were administered to 32 DD children (16 with additional LI) and 16 controls. Behavioral data revealed quantitative differences among groups: DD+LI children showed the worst performance, followed by DD-only children and controls. Event-related potential results confirmed atypical morphosyntactic processing in the DD-only group, highlighting qualitative differences between groups. These results support multifactor models of learning disabilities, where different patterns of deficits characterize different subgroups.

Mathematical abilities in dyslexic children: a diffusion tensor imaging study.Dyslexia_HP is characterized by a deficit in language processing which mainly affects word decoding and spelling skills. In addition, children with Dyslexia_HP also show problems in mathematics. However, for the latter, the underlying structural correlates have not been investigated. Sixteen children with Dyslexia_HP (mean age 9.8 years [0.39]) and 24 typically developing children (mean age 9.9 years [0.29]) group matched for age, gender, IQ, and handedness underwent 3 T MR diffusion tensor imaging as well as cognitive testing. Tract-Based Spatial Statistics were performed to correlate behavioral data with diffusion data. Children with Dyslexia_HP performed worse than controls in standardized verbal number tasks, such as arithmetic efficiency tests (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). In contrast, the two groups did not differ in the Absent_speech_HP number line task. Arithmetic efficiency, representing the total score of the four arithmetic tasks, multiplication, and division, correlated with diffusion measures in widespread areas of the white matter, including Bilateral_HP superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi in children with Dyslexia_HP compared to controls. Children with Dyslexia_HP demonstrated lower performance in verbal number tasks but performed similarly to controls in a Absent_speech_HP number task. Further, an association between verbal arithmetic efficiency and diffusion measures was demonstrated in widespread areas of the white matter suggesting compensatory mechanisms in children with Dyslexia_HP compared to controls. Taken together, poor fact retrieval in children with Dyslexia_HP is likely a consequence of deficits in the language system, which not only affects literacy skills but also impacts on arithmetic skills.

[A case of pure Alexia_HP and foreign accent syndrome following Acute_Encephalopathy_HP in the presence of anti-glutamate receptor antibodies].A 41-year-old Right_HP-handed woman presented abnormal behavior two weeks after suffering from Headache_HP and Fever_HP. Anti-glutamate receptor antibodies in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid were positive and we diagnosed anti-glutamate receptor antibody-related Encephalopathy_HP. The patient improved after administration of corticosteroid and was discharged without neurological deficit. After discharge, pure Alexia_HP and foreign accent syndrome-like language disturbance appeared consecutively. The serial fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scans suggested that pure Alexia_HP and FAS-like language disturbance may have been caused by low function of the occipital lobes and the Left_HP frontal lobe, respectively. FAS has been linked to various lesions in the brain. The background mechanism may therefore be Heterogeneous_HP On the other hand, patients with this syndrome recover spontaneously with our case. FAS may therefore be a temporal phenomenon resulting from Postural_instability_HP in language processing rather than a specific deficit.

Early identification and interventions for Dyslexia_HP: a contemporary view.This paper reviews current proposals concerning the definition of Dyslexia_HP and contrasts it with reading comprehension impairment. We then discuss methods for early identification and review evidence that teacher assessments and ratings may be valid screening tools. Finally, we argue that interventions should be theoretically motivated and evidence based. We conclude that early identification of children at risk of Dyslexia_HP followed by the implementation of intervention is a realistic aim for practitioners and policy-makers.

Learning to Read: What We Know and What We Need to Understand Better.The authors review current knowledge about the cognitive processes underlying the early stages of word reading development. Recent findings in a variety of alphabetic languages converge on the conclusion that there are 3 "cognitive foundations" for learning to read: letter-sound knowledge, phonemic awareness, and rapid automatized naming skills. Deficits in each of these skills appear causally related to problems in learning to read, and deficits in letter-sound knowledge and phonemic awareness appear to be remediable by suitable teaching. The authors argue that this evidence has important practical implications for early education and for the Diagnosis_ASDPTO and treatment of children with reading difficulties.

Designing an Assistive Learning Aid for Writing Acquisition: A Challenge for Children with Dyslexia_HP.In Pakistan, the biggest challenge is to provide high quality education to the individuals with learning disabilities. Besides the well known affordance issue, there is a lack of awareness regarding the term Dyslexia_HP and remedial teaching training that causes the identification as well as remediation of the dyslexic individuals at early stages in Pakistan. The research was focused to exploit the benefits of using the modern mobile technology features in providing a learning platform for young dyslexic writers. Based on potential usability requirements of young dyslexic writers stated by remedial teachers of dyslexics, an android based application is designed and implemented using the usability engineering process model to encourage the learning process and help dyslexic children improve their fundamental handwriting skill. In addition, a handwriting learning algorithm based on concepts of machine learning is designed and implemented to decide the learning content, evaluate the learning performance, display the performance results and record the learning growth to show the strengths and weaknesses of a dyslexic child. The research was also aimed to assess the usability of the learner-centered application by the targeted population by conducting a user acceptance test to evaluate their learning experience and benefits of the developed application to dyslexic users. The results of the evaluation provided by the participants revealed that application has potential benefits to foster the learning process and help children with Dyslexia_HP by improving their foundational writing skills.

A screening on Specific Learning_Disorders_ASDPTO in an Italian speaking high genetic homogeneity area.The aim of the present research is to investigate the prevalence of Specific Learning_Disorders_ASDPTO (SLD) in Ogliastra, an area of the island of Sardinia, Italy. Having experienced centuries of isolation, Ogliastra has become a high genetic homogeneity area, and is considered particularly interesting for studies on different kinds of pathologies. Here we are going to describe the results of a screening carried out throughout 2 consecutive years in 49 second grade classes (24 considered in the first year and 25 in the second year of the study) of the Ogliastra region. A total of 610 pupils (average age 7.54 years; 293 female, 317 male) corresponding to 68.69% of all pupils who were attending second grade in the area, took part in the study. The tool used for the screening was "RSR-DSA. Questionnaire for the detection of learning difficulties and disorders", which allowed the identification of 83 subjects at risk (13.61% of the whole sample involved in the study). These subjects took part in an enhancement training program of about 6 months. After the program, pupils underwent assessment for reading, writing and calculation abilities, as well as cognitive assessment. According to the results of the assessment, the prevalence of SLDs is 6.06%. For what concerns Dyslexia_HP, 4.75% of the total sample manifested this disorder either in isolation or in comorbidity with other disorders. According to the first national epidemiological investigation carried out in Italy, the prevalence of Dyslexia_HP is 3.1-3.2%, which is lower than the prevalence obtained in the present study. Given the genetic basis of SLDs, this result, together with the presence of several cases of SLD in isolation (17.14%) and with a 3:1 ratio of males to females diagnosed with a SLD, was to be expected in a sample coming from a high genetic homogeneity area.

Genetic transmission of reading ability.Reading is the processing of written language. Family resemblance for reading (dis)ability might be due to transmission of a genetic liability or due to family environment, including cultural transmission from parents to offspring. Familial-risk studies exploring neurobehavioral precursors for Dyslexia_HP and twin studies can only speak to some of these issues, but a combined twin-family study can resolve the nature of the transmitted risk. Word-reading fluency scores of 1100 participants from 431 families (with twins, siblings and their parents) were analyzed to estimate genetic and environmental sources of variance, and to test the presence of assortative mating and cultural transmission. Results show that variation in reading ability is mainly caused by additive and non-additive genetic factors (64%). The substantial assortative mating (r

White matter integrity of cerebellar-cortical tracts in reading impaired children: A probabilistic tractography study.Little is known about the white matter integrity of cerebellar-cortical pathways in individuals with Dyslexia_HP. Building on previous findings of decreased volume in the anterior lobe of the cerebellum, we utilized novel cerebellar segmentation procedures and probabilistic tractography to examine tracts that connect the anterior lobe of the cerebellum and cortical regions typically associated with reading: the temporoparietal (TP), occipitotemporal (OT), and inferior frontal (IF) regions. The sample included 29 reading impaired children and 27 typical readers. We found greater fractional anisotropy (FA) for the poor readers in tracts connecting the cerebellum with TP and IF regions relative to typical readers. In the OT region, FA was greater for the older poor readers, but smaller for the younger ones. This study provides evidence for discrete, regionally-bound functions of the cerebellum and suggests that projections from the anterior cerebellum appear to have a regulatory effect on cortical pathways important for reading.

The enigmatic linguistic cerebellum: clinical relevance and unanswered questions on nonmotor speech and language deficits in cerebellar disorders.Clinical case descriptions and experimental evidence dating back to the early part of the 19th century from time to time documented a range of nonmotor cognitive and Affect_ASDPTOive impairments following cerebellar pathology. However, a causal relationship between disruption of nonmotor cognitive and Affect_ASDPTOive skills and cerebellar disease was dismissed for several decades and the classical view of the cerebellum as a mere coordinator of autonomic and somatic sensorimotor function prevailed for more than two centuries in behavioural neuroscience. The ignorance of early clinical evidence suggesting a much richer and complex role for the cerebellum than a pure sensorimotor one is remarkable given that in addition: 1) the cerebellum contains more neurons than the rest of the combined cerebral cortex and 2) no other structure has as many connections with other parts of the brain as the cerebellum. During the past decades, the long-standing view of the cerebellum as pure coordinator of sensorimotor function has been substantially modified. From the late 1970s onwards, major advances were made in elucidating the many functional neuroanatomical connections of the cerebellum with the supratentorial association cortices that subserve nonmotor language, cognition and Affect_ASDPTO. Combined with evidence derived from experimental functional neuroimaging studies in Healthy_HP subjects and neurophysiological and neuropsychological research in patients, the role of the cerebellum has been substantially extended to include that of a crucial modulator of cognitive and Affect_ASDPTOive processes. In addition to its long-established role in coordinating motor aspects of speech production, clinical and experimental studies with patients suffering from etiologically different cerebellar disorders have identified involvement of the cerebellum in a variety of nonmotor language functions, including motor speech Planning_ASDPTO, language dynamics and verbal fluency, phonological and semantic word retrieval, expressive and Receptive_Syntax_ASDPTO processing, various aspects of Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO and Aphasia_HP-like phenomena. Despite considerable efforts currently devoted to further refine typology and anatomoclinical configurations of nonmotor linguistic dysfunctions linked to cerebellar pathology, the exact underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of cerebellar involvement remain to be elucidated.

Silent reading fluency: Implications for the assessment of adults with developmental Dyslexia_HP.Understanding silent reading fluency (SRF) is of a paramount importance, given that silent reading is the principal manner of reading for capable readers. But the assessment of SRF is not commonly useful for identifying students with reading difficulties and monitoring their progress. The paper presents the SRF scores of adults with Dyslexia_HP compared to SRF scores of skilled readers and discusses the power of the SRF measure in identifying adults with specific Learning_Disorders_ASDPTO with impairment in reading.

Impaired Driving Performance as Evidence of a Magnocellular Deficit in Dyslexia_HP and Visual Stress.High comorbidity and an overlap in symptomology have been demonstrated between Dyslexia_HP and visual stress. Several researchers have hypothesized an underlying or causal influence that may account for this relationship. The magnocellular theory of Dyslexia_HP proposes that a deficit in visuo-temporal processing can explain symptomology for both disorders. If the magnocellular theory holds true, individuals who experience symptomology for these disorders should show impairment on a visuo-temporal task, such as driving. Eighteen male participants formed the sample for this study. Self-report measures assessed Dyslexia_HP and visual stress symptomology as well as participant IQ. Participants completed a drive simulation in which errors in response to road signs were measured. Bivariate correlations revealed significant associations between scores on measures of Dyslexia_HP and visual stress. Results also demonstrated that self-reported symptomology predicts magnocellular impairment as measured by performance on a driving task. Results from this study suggest that a magnocellular deficit offers a likely explanation for individuals who report high symptomology across both conditions. While conclusions about the impact of these disorders on driving performance should not be derived from this research alone, this study provides a platform for the development of future research, utilizing a clinical population and on-road driving assessment techniques.

Pay Attention!: Sluggish Multisensory Attentional Shifting as a Core Deficit in Developmental Dyslexia_HP.The aim of this review is to provide a background on the neurocognitive aspects of the reading process and review neuroscientific studies of individuals with developmental Dyslexia_HP, which provide evidence for amodal processing deficits. Hari, Renvall, and Tanskanen (2001) propose amodal sluggish attentional shifting (SAS) as a causal factor for temporal processing deficits in Dyslexia_HP. Undergirding this theory is the notion that when dyslexics are faced with rapid sequences of stimuli, their automatic attentional systems fail to disengage efficiently, which leads to difficulty when moving from one item to the next (Lallier et al., ). This results in atypical perception of rapid stimulus sequences. Until recently, the SAS theory, particularly the examination of amodal attentional deficits, was studied solely through the use of behavioural measures (Facoetti et al., ; Facoetti, Lorusso, Cattaneo, Galli, & Molteni, ). This paper examines evidence within the literature that provides a basis for further exploration of amodal SAS as an underlying deficit in developmental Dyslexia_HP.

A Computational Model of Implicit Memory Captures Dyslexics' Perceptual Deficits.Dyslexics are diagnosed for their poor reading skills, yet they characteristically also suffer from poor verbal memory and often from poor auditory skills. To date, this combined profile has been accounted for in broad cognitive terms. Here we hypothesize that the perceptual deficits associated with Dyslexia_HP can be understood computationally as a deficit in integrating prior information with noisy observations. To test this hypothesis we analyzed the performance of human participants in an auditory discrimination task using a two-parameter computational model. One parameter captures the internal noise in representing the current event, and the other captures the impact of recently acquired prior information. Our findings show that dyslexics' perceptual deficit can be accounted for by inadequate adjustment of these components; namely, low weighting of their implicit memory of past trials relative to their internal noise. Underweighting the stimulus statistics decreased dyslexics' ability to compensate for noisy observations. ERP measurements (P2 component) while participants watched a silent movie indicated that dyslexics' perceptual deficiency may stem from poor automatic integration of stimulus statistics. This study provides the first description of a specific computational deficit associated with Dyslexia_HP.

Developmental evaluation of atypical auditory sampling in Dyslexia_HP: Functional and structural evidence.Whether phonological deficits in developmental Dyslexia_HP are associated with impaired neural sampling of auditory information at either syllabic- or phonemic-rates is still under debate. In addition, whereas neuroanatomical alterations in auditory regions have been documented in dyslexic readers, whether and how these structural anomalies are linked to auditory sampling and reading deficits remains poorly understood. In this study, we measured auditory neural synchronization at different frequencies corresponding to relevant phonological spectral components of speech in children and adults with and without Dyslexia_HP, using magnetoencephalography. Furthermore, structural MRI was used to estimate cortical thickness of the auditory cortex of participants. Dyslexics showed atypical brain synchronization at both syllabic (slow) and phonemic (fast) rates. Interestingly, while a Left_HP hemispheric asymmetry in cortical thickness was functionally related to a stronger Left_HP hemispheric lateralization of neural synchronization to stimuli presented at the phonemic rate in skilled readers, the same anatomical index in dyslexics was related to a stronger Right_HP hemispheric dominance for neural synchronization to syllabic-rate auditory stimuli. These data suggest that the acoustic sampling deficit in development Dyslexia_HP might be linked to an atypical specialization of the auditory cortex to both low and high Frequency_HP amplitude modulations.

Relative Ease in Creating Detailed Orthographic Representations Contrasted with Severe_HP Difficulties to Maintain Them in Long-term Memory Among Dyslexic Children.Most research into orthographic learning abilities has been conducted in English with typically developing children using reading-based tasks. In the present study, we examined the abilities of French-speaking children with Dyslexia_HP to create novel orthographic representations for subsequent use in spelling and to maintain them in long-term memory. Their performance was compared with that of chronological age (CA)-matched and reading age (RA)-matched control children. We used an experimental task designed to provide optimal learning conditions (i.e. 10 spelling practice trials) ensuring the short-term acquisition of the spelling of the target orthographic word forms. After a 1-week delay, the long-term retention of the targets was assessed by a spelling post-test. Analysis of the results revealed that, in the short term, children with Dyslexia_HP learned the novel orthographic word forms well, only differing from both CA and RA controls on the initial decoding of the targets and from CA controls on the first two practice trials. In contrast, a dramatic drop was observed in their long-term retention relative to CA and RA controls. These results support the suggestion of the self-teaching hypothesis (Share, 1995) that initial errors in the decoding and spelling of unfamiliar words may hinder the establishment of fully specified novel orthographic representations.

More Bilateral_HP, more anterior: Alterations of brain organization in the large-scale structural network in Chinese Dyslexia_HP.Abnormalities in large-scale brain networks have been recently reported in Dyslexia_HP; however, it remains unclear whether these abnormalities are congenital (due to Dyslexia_HP per se) or arise later in development. Here, structural magnetic resonance imaging data of 17 Chinese reading disabled (RD) and 17 age-matched typically developing (TD) children were used to construct cortical thickness (sensitive to postnatal development) and surface area (sensitive to prenatal development) networks. In the thickness network, compared to TD, RD showed reduced nodal network properties (e.g., degree and betweenness) in the Left_HP hemisphere along with enhanced nodal properties mainly in the Right_HP hemisphere. As for the surface area network, compared to TD, RD demonstrated lower nodal properties in the posterior brain regions and higher nodal properties in the anterior brain regions. Furthermore, hubs in both the thickness and surface area networks in RD were more distributed in frontal areas and less distributed in parietal areas, whereas TD showed the opposite pattern. Altogether, these findings indicate that the aberrant structural connectivity in the dyslexic individuals was not only due to a late developmental effect reflected in the altered thickness network, but may also be a congenital effect during prenatal development, reflected in the altered surface network.

Double Disassociation of Anosognosia for Alexia_HP and Simultanagnosia but Quantitative Awareness of Optic_Ataxia_HP.A 66-yr-old man with a history of Atrial_fibrillation_HP and a pacemaker developed sudden Onset_HP Confusion_HP, Confusion_HP, and visual disturbance without motor weakness. Clinically, significant deficits were found in reading (Alexia_HP) and simultaneous multiobject perception (simultanagnosia), both of which the patient denied limitation in, and in vision-Right_HP Hemianopia_HP-which he readily acknowledged. Visual acuity in the Left_HP visual field was normal. The patient also demonstrated a symptom of Optic_Ataxia_HP-a lack of coordination between visual inputs and hand movements-a deficit he also acknowledged. Work-up with computed topography revealed a Left_HP posterior cerebral artery infarct affecting the occipital lobe and extending to involve the parietal lobe and the splenium of the corpus callosum. The authors describe and discuss this fascinating case-the first case to their knowledge of a double disassociation of anosognosia for Alexia_HP and simultanagnosia but full, indeed quantitative, awareness of Hemianopia_HP and Optic_Ataxia_HP. This case may be informative on the mechanism of anosognosia in general and supports intentional feed-forward and exemplar reafference models. With regard to the rehabilitation process, appreciation that a patient has anosognosia for various deficits is crucial in recovery and health maintenance.

Alexia_HP Without Agraphia in a Right_HP-Handed Individual Following Right_HP Occipital Stroke_HP.Alexia_HP without agraphia is a disconnection syndrome that typically involves damage to the occipital lobe, with splenium involvement, in the dominant Left_HP hemisphere. We describe an exceptionally rare case of a Right_HP-handed individual displaying this deficit following a Right_HP-sided occipital Stroke_HP. A report of a single case of a 65-year-old man is presented with data from appointments with the neurology and neuropsychology departments that occurred approximately 10 and 12 months following the patient's Stroke_HP. During the evaluation, he exhibited a marked deficit in his ability to read, with vision grossly intact. His ability to write single words and short phrases from dictation was intact, but he was later unable to read them. This case demonstrates the complexity of the organization of language in the human brain. Although a large majority of individuals exhibit language dominance in their Left_HP hemispheres, it remains possible that some Right_HP-handed individuals may show atypical organization of language. This highlights the need for clinicians to consider atypical cortical organization when observed deficits may not necessarily match expected lesions within the cortex.

Too little or too much? Parafoveal preview benefits and parafoveal load costs in dyslexic adults.Two different forms of parafoveal dysfunction have been hypothesized as core deficits of dyslexic individuals: reduced parafoveal preview benefits ("too little parafovea") and increased costs of parafoveal load ("too much parafovea"). We tested both hypotheses in a single eye-tracking experiment using a modified serial rapid automatized naming (RAN) task. Comparisons between dyslexic and non-dyslexic adults showed reduced parafoveal preview benefits in dyslexics, without increased costs of parafoveal load. Reduced parafoveal preview benefits were observed in a naming task, but not in a silent letter-finding task, indicating that the parafoveal dysfunction may be consequent to the overload with extracting phonological information from orthographic input. Our results suggest that dyslexics' parafoveal dysfunction is not based on strict visuo-attentional factors, but nevertheless they stress the importance of extra-phonological processing. Furthermore, evidence of reduced parafoveal preview benefits in Dyslexia_HP may help understand why serial RAN is an important reading predictor in adulthood.

Mutation in CEP63 co-segregating with developmental Dyslexia_HP in a Swedish family.Developmental Dyslexia_HP is the most common learning disorder in children. Problems in Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO are likely due to a complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors, resulting in reduced power of studies of the genetic factors underlying developmental Dyslexia_HP. Our approach in the current study was to perform exome sequencing of Affected_HP and unAffected_HP individuals within an extended pedigree with a familial form of developmental Dyslexia_HP. We identified a two-base mutation, causing a p.R229L amino acid substitution in the centrosomal protein 63 kDa (CEP63), co-segregating with developmental Dyslexia_HP in this pedigree. This mutation is novel, and predicted to be highly damaging for the function of the protein. 3D modelling suggested a distinct conformational change caused by the mutation. CEP63 is Localized_HP to the centrosome in eukaryotic cells and is required for maintaining normal centriole duplication and control of cell cycle progression. We found that a common polymorphism in the CEP63 gene had a significant association with brain white matter volume. The brain regions were partly overlapping with the previously reported region influenced by polymorphisms in the Dyslexia_HP susceptibility genes DYX1C1 and KIAA0319. We hypothesise that CEP63 is particularly important for brain development and might control the proliferation and migration of cells when those two events need to be highly coordinated.

Our approach in the current study was to perform exome sequencing of affected and unaffected individuals within an extended pedigree with a familial form of developmental dyslexia. We identified a two-base mutation, causing a p.R229L amino acid substitution in the centrosomal protein 63 kDa (CEP63), co-segregating with developmental dyslexia in this pedigree. This mutation is novel, and predicted to be highly damaging for the function of the protein. 3D modelling suggested a distinct conformational change caused by the mutation. CEP63 is localised to the centrosome in eukaryotic cells and is required for maintaining normal centriole duplication and control of cell cycle progression. We found that a common polymorphism in the CEP63 gene had a significant association with brain white matter volume. The brain regions were partly overlapping with the previously reported region influenced by polymorphisms in the dyslexia susceptibility genes DYX1C1 and KIAA0319. We hypothesise that CEP63 is particularly important for brain development and might control the proliferation and migration of cells when those two events need to be highly coordinated.
Music Training Increases Phonological Awareness and Reading Skills in Developmental Dyslexia_HP: A Randomized Control Trial.There is some evidence for a role of music training in boosting phonological awareness, word segmentation, Working_Memory_ASDPTO, as well as reading abilities in children with typical development. Poor performance in tasks requiring temporal processing, rhythm perception and sensorimotor synchronization seems to be a crucial factor underlying Dyslexia_HP in children. Interestingly, children with Dyslexia_HP show deficits in temporal processing, both in language and in music. Within this framework, we test the hypothesis that music training, by improving temporal processing and rhythm abilities, improves phonological awareness and reading skills in children with Dyslexia_HP. The study is a prospective, multicenter, open randomized controlled trial, consisting of test, rehabilitation and re-test (ID NCT02316873). After rehabilitation, the music group (N = 24) performed better than the control group (N = 22) in tasks assessing rhythmic abilities, phonological awareness and reading skills. This is the first randomized control trial testing the effect of music training in enhancing phonological and reading abilities in children with Dyslexia_HP. The findings show that music training can modify reading and phonological abilities even when these skills are severely impaired. Through the enhancement of temporal processing and rhythmic skills, music might become an important tool in both remediation and early intervention programs.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02316873

Double-letter processing in surface Dyslexia_HP and Dysgraphia_HP following a Left_HP temporal lesion: A multimodal neuroimaging study.Neuropsychological data about acquired impairments in Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO provide a strong basis for the theoretical framework of the dual-route models. The present study explored the functional neuroanatomy of the reading and spelling processing system. We describe the Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO performance of patient CF, an Italian native speaker who developed an extremely selective reading and spelling deficit (his spontaneous speech, oral comprehension, repetition and oral picture naming were almost unimpaired) in processing double letters associated with surface Dyslexia_HP and Dysgraphia_HP, following a Neoplasm_HP in the Left_HP temporal lobe. In particular, the majority of CF's errors in spelling were phonologically plausible substitutions, errors concerning letter numerosity of consonants, and syllabic phoneme-to-grapheme conversion (PGC) errors. A similar pattern of impairment also emerged in his reading behavior, with a majority of lexical stress errors (the only possible type of surface reading errors in the Italian language, due the extreme regularity of print-to-sound correspondence). CF's neuropsychological profile was combined with structural neuroimaging data, fiber tracking, and functional maps and compared to that of Healthy_HP control participants. We related CF's deficit to a dissociation between impaired ventral/lexical route (as evidenced by a fractional anisotropy - FA decrease along the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus - IFOF) and relatively preserved dorsal/phonological route (as evidenced by a rather full integrity of the superior longitudinal fasciculus - SLF). In terms of functional processing, the lexical-semantic ventral route network was more activated in controls than in CF, while the network supporting the dorsal route was shared by CF and the control participants. Our results are discussed within the theoretical framework of dual-route models of reading and spelling, emphasize the importance of the IFOF both in lexical reading and spelling, and offer a better comprehension of the neurological and functional substrates involved in written language and, in particular, in surface Dyslexia_HP and Dysgraphia_HP and in doubling/de-doubling consonant sounds and letters.

Incidental learning of sound categories is impaired in developmental Dyslexia_HP.Developmental Dyslexia_HP is commonly thought to arise from specific phonological impairments. However, recent evidence is consistent with the possibility that phonological impairments arise as symptoms of an underlying dysfunction of procedural learning. The nature of the link between impaired procedural learning and phonological dysfunction is unresolved. Motivated by the observation that speech processing involves the acquisition of procedural category knowledge, the present study investigates the possibility that procedural learning impairment may Affect_ASDPTO phonological processing by interfering with the typical course of phonetic category learning. The present study tests this hypothesis while controlling for linguistic experience and possible speech-specific deficits by comparing auditory category learning across artificial, nonlinguistic sounds among dyslexic adults and matched controls in a specialized first-person shooter videogame that has been shown to engage procedural learning. Nonspeech auditory category learning was assessed online via within-game measures and also with a post-training task involving overt categorization of familiar and novel sound exemplars. Each measure reveals that dyslexic participants do not acquire procedural category knowledge as effectively as age- and cognitive-ability matched controls. This difference cannot be explained by differences in perceptual acuity for the sounds. Moreover, poor nonspeech category learning is associated with slower phonological processing. Whereas phonological processing impairments have been emphasized as the cause of Dyslexia_HP, the current results suggest that impaired auditory category learning, general in nature and not specific to speech signals, could contribute to phonological deficits in Dyslexia_HP with subsequent negative effects on language acquisition and reading. Implications for the neuro-cognitive mechanisms of developmental Dyslexia_HP are discussed.

Neuropsychological Thoughts, Then and Now: A Tribute to Oscar Marin.This brief paper, inspired by an invitation to acknowledge and celebrate Oscar Marin's great contributions to cognitive neurology and neuropsychology, reviews the case of a patient, T.P., who had significant deficits of naming, reading, and spelling. I first studied and reported this patient 35 years ago, in 1979, when I was significantly influenced by the work of Oscar Marin and his colleagues. I have recently had the unusual opportunity to do some brief reassessment of T.P.'s current (2015) cognitive abilities, and to reassess the interpretations that I had given to her pattern of impairment in the initial studies. I suggest that advances over the last decade or so-in theorizing about, and connectionist modeling of, reading and spelling disorders-enable a more coherent account of T.P.'s acquired Anomia_HP, Dyslexia_HP, and Dysgraphia_HP, and the relationships among them.

What automaticity deficit? Activation of lexical information by readers with Dyslexia_HP in a rapid automatized naming Stroop-switch task.Reading fluency is often predicted by rapid automatized naming (RAN) speed, which as the name implies, measures the automaticity with which familiar stimuli (e.g., letters) can be retrieved and named. Readers with Dyslexia_HP are considered to have less "automatized" access to lexical information, reflected in longer RAN times compared with nondyslexic readers. We combined the RAN task with a Stroop-switch manipulation to test the automaticity of dyslexic and nondyslexic readers' lexical access directly within a fluency task. Participants named letters in 10 × 4 arrays while eye movements and speech responses were recorded. Upon fixation, specific letter font colors changed from black to a different color, whereupon the participant was required to rapidly switch from naming the letter to naming the letter color. We could therefore measure reading group differences on "automatic" lexical processing, insofar as it was task-irrelevant. Readers with Dyslexia_HP showed obligatory lexical processing and a timeline for recognition that was overall similar to typical readers, but a delay emerged in the output (naming) phase. Further delay was caused by visual-orthographic competition between neighboring stimuli. Our findings outline the specific processes involved when researchers speak of "impaired automaticity" in dyslexic readers' fluency, and are discussed in the context of the broader literature in this field.

Verbal Short-Term Memory Deficits in Chinese Children with Dyslexia_HP may not be a Problem with the Activation of Phonological Representations.This study explored the underlying mechanism of the verbal short-term memory deficit in Chinese children with developmental Dyslexia_HP. Twenty-four children with Dyslexia_HP and 28 age-matched normal readers participated in the study. They were required to memorize a visually presented series of six Chinese characters and identify them from a list also including code-specific distracters and non-code-specific distracters. Error rates were recorded and were higher for code-specific distracters in all three conditions, revealing phonological, visual, and semantic similarity effects respectively. Group comparisons showed a stronger phonological similarity effect in dyslexic group, suggesting intact activation of phonological representations of target characters. Children with Dyslexia_HP also exhibited a greater semantic similarity effect, revealing stronger activation of semantic representations, while visual similarity effects were equivalent to controls. These results suggest that the verbal short-term memory deficit in Chinese dyslexics might not stem from insufficient activation of phonological information. Based the semantic activation of target characters in dyslexics is greater than in controls, it is possible that the memory deficit of Dyslexia_HP is related with deficient inhibition of target semantic representations in short-term memory.

Altered connectivity of the dorsal and ventral visual regions in dyslexic children: a resting-state fMRI study.While there is emerging evidence from behavioral studies that visual attention skills are impaired in Dyslexia_HP, the corresponding neural mechanism (i.e., deficits in the dorsal visual region) needs further investigation. We used resting-state fMRI to explore the functional connectivity (FC) patterns of the Left_HP intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and the visual word form area (VWFA) in dyslexic children (N = 21, age mean = 12) and age-matched controls (N = 26, age mean = 12). The results showed that the Left_HP IPS and the VWFA were functionally connected to each other in both groups and that both were functionally connected to Left_HP middle frontal gyrus (MFG). Importantly, we observed significant group differences in FC between the Left_HP IPS and the Left_HP MFG and between the VWFA and the Left_HP MFG. In addition, the strengths of the identified FCs were significantly correlated with the score of fluent reading, which required obvious eye movement and visual attention processing, but not with the lexical decision score. We conclude that dyslexics have deficits in the network composed of the prefrontal, dorsal visual and ventral visual regions and may have a lack of modulation from the Left_HP MFG to the dorsal and ventral visual regions.

The distinctive vertical Heterophoria_HP of dyslexics.In this study, we looked for the presence of vertical Heterophoria_HP (VH) in 42 dyslexic children (22 males and 20 females) aged 118.5±12.9 months who were compared with a control group of 22 nondyslexic children (eleven males and eleven females) aged 112±9.8 months. Dyslexics presented a low-level (always <1 prism diopter) VH combined with torsion. This oculomotor feature clearly separates the dyslexic group from the normal readers group. It is independent of the type of Dyslexia_HP. The essential feature of this VH is a lability that appears during specific stimulation of sensory receptors involved in postural regulation. This lability is demonstrated using a vertical Maddox test conducted under very specific conditions in which postural sensors are successively stimulated in a predetermined order. A quantitative variation in this VH may be seen during the Bielchowsky Head Tilt Test, which reveals Hypertonia_HP of the lower or upper oblique muscles. Vertical orthophoria can be achieved by placing low-power prisms asymmetrically within the direction of action of the superior or inferior oblique muscles. The selection of power and axis is not only guided by elements of the eye examination but also from observation of postural muscle tone. All these elements suggest that the VH could be of postural origin and somehow related to the vertical action of the oblique muscles. VH and torsion are not harmful per se. There is no statistical relationship between their level and the various parameters used to assess the reading skills of dyslexic children. VH and torsion could be a clinical marker of global proprioceptive dysfunction responsible for high-level multisensory disturbances secondary to poor spatial localization of visual and auditory information. This dysfunction might also explain the motor disorders concomitant to Dyslexia_HP.

The relations between reading and spelling: an examination of subtypes of Dyslexia_HP.Three groups of reading-disabled children were found in studies of English, German, and French: a group with a double deficit in reading and spelling, a group with a single spelling deficit, and a more rarely reported group presenting a single reading deficit. This study set out to examine whether these groups can be found in adults, readers and spellers of Hebrew, which differs from the previously studied orthographies in many aspects. To this end, Hebrew-speaking adults with or without Dyslexia_HP were administered various literacy and literacy-related tests. Results confirm the existence of the same three groups. While all shared a phonological deficit, subtle differences in phonological decoding ability and in speed of processing distinguished between the groups. The study therefore suggests that the previously reported associations and dissociations between reading and spelling are not restricted to English, German, or French and may not be only developmental in nature.

Genetic variant in DIP2A gene is associated with developmental Dyslexia_HP in Chinese population.Increasing evidence suggests that there is a substantial heritable component including several risk loci and candidate genes for developmental Dyslexia_HP (DD). DIP2A has been identified to be partially deleted on chromosome region 21q22.3, which cosegregates with DD. And it fits into a theoretical molecular network of DD implicated in the development of DD. Compared with some DD candidate genes that have been extensively studied (e.g., DYX1C1, DCDC2, KIAA0319, and ROBO1), very little is known about the association between candidate gene DIP2A and DD susceptibility. And given the linguistic and genetic differences between Chinese and other Western populations, it is worthwhile validating the association of DIP2A in Chinese dyslexic children. Here, we investigated two genetic variants, selected by bioinformatics analysis, in DIP2A in a Chinese population with 409 dyslexic cases and 410 Healthy_HP controls. We observed a significantly increased DD risk associated with rs2255526 G allele (OR = 1.297, 95% CI = 1.036-1.623, Padjusted  = 0.023) and GG genotypes (OR = 1.833, 95% CI = 1.043-3.223, Padjusted  = 0.035), compared with their wild-type counterparts. In addition, it was marginally significantly associated with DD under the recessive model (OR = 1.677, 95% CI = 0.967-2.908, Padjusted  = 0.066) and the dominant model (OR = 1.314, 95% CI = 0.992-1.741, Padjusted  = 0.057). However, we found no evidence of an association of SNP rs16979358 with DD. In conclusion, this study showed that a genetic variant in the DIP2A gene was associated with increased DD risk in China.

Neurodevelopmental sequelae associated with gray and white matter changes and their cellular basis: A comparison between Autistic_behavior_HP, ADHD and Dyslexia_HP.Many psychiatric diseases, such as major Depression_ASDPTO and Schizophrenia_HP, are accompanied by patterns of gray matter and white matter changes in the cortex that may be due to structural pathologies of synapses and their dendrites in the gray matter on the one hand and to pathologies in myelinating oligodendrocytes on the other. Here the possibility has been briefly examined that such a generalization might also hold for Autistic Spectrum Disorders (Autistic_behavior_HP). Evidence is presented that gray matter changes that accompany Autistic_behavior_HP may in fact reflect changes in synapses and subsequently of their dendrites, whereas those in the white matter reflect changes in myelination due to pathologies of oligodendrocytes. It is proposed that such structural pathologies during development provide a coherent biological model not only for the Onset_HP and course of Autistic_behavior_HP but also provide the basis for development and systematic evaluation of new treatment strategies.

Word and line bisection in typical and impaired readers and a cross-language comparison.Observers exhibit larger Left_HPward bias when bisecting words compared with lines. According to the Attentional Scaling Hypothesis, attempting to access lexical entries involves focusing attention on the initial letters of words to establish a cohort of potential matches with entries in the mental lexicon. We test this account by examining two predictions: (1) greater Left_HPward bias for words should be evident in English readers in which the word beginning is on the Left_HP but not in Hebrew readers. (2) Dyslexics who have lexical impairments should show greater bias. Results reveal that word length modulated bisection bias differently for Hebrew and English readers, although the bias stays always Left_HPward. Furthermore, dyslexics exhibited an exaggerated Left_HPward bias than controls. We propose this effect arises from an interaction between reading and spatial attention rather than from the scaling of attention relative to the beginning of the word in the service of lexical access.

Academic Achievement of University Students with Dyslexia_HP.Broadened recruitment to higher education is on the agenda in many countries, and it is also widely recognized that the number of dyslexic students entering higher education is increasing. In Sweden, as in many other European countries, higher education institutions are required to accommodate students with Dyslexia_HP. The present study focuses on the study outcome for 50 students with diagnosed Dyslexia_HP, mainly in teacher education and nurses' training, at three universities in Northern Sweden. The students trusted their own ability to find information on the Internet but mistrusted their own abilities in reading course books and articles in English and in taking notes. The mean rate of study was 23.5 European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System credits per semester, which is slightly below the national baseline of 26.7. The results show that more than half of the students are examined at a normal rate of study but that about one fifth have a very low rate of study. Messages Most students with Dyslexia_HP can compensate for their reading problems. Taking notes during lessons and reading in foreign language may be especially difficult for students with Dyslexia_HP. Diagnoses should distinguish between reading comprehension and word decoding. More than half of the students with Dyslexia_HP can achieve at a normal rate of study. One-fifth of the students with Dyslexia_HP may need a longer period of study than other students.

Naming Speed of Adolescents and Young Adults with Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_HP: Differences in Alphanumeric Versus Color/Object Naming.This study investigated the performance of adolescents and young adults with Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_HP (ADHD), Reading Disorder (RD), and ADHD/RD on measures of alphanumeric and nonalphanumeric naming speed and the relationship between naming speed and academic achievement. The sample (N = 203) included students aged 17-28 years diagnosed with ADHD (n = 83), RD (n = 71), or ADHD/RD (n = 49). Individuals with ADHD performed significantly faster on measures of alphanumeric naming compared with RD and comorbid groups and, within group, demonstrated significantly quicker naming of letters/digits compared with colors/objects. Both alphanumeric rapid naming scores and processing speed scores variably predicted academic achievement scores across groups, whereas nonalphanumeric rapid naming only predicted reading comprehension scores within the ADHD group. Results support findings that older individuals with ADHD show relative weakness in rapid naming of objects and colors. Implications of these findings in regard to assessment of older individuals for ADHD are discussed.

DOES Dyslexia_HP DEVELOP FROM Left_HP-EYE DOMINANCE?The purpose of this theoretical analysis and synthesis is to indicate how Left_HP-eye sighting dominance may lead to reading failure through dysfunctional Right_HP hemisphere letter encoding. Differing compensatory strategies are postulated to lead to outcomes that include the development of the phonologically impaired and phonologically proficient subtypes of Dyslexia_HP as well as specific spelling disability. Evidence is presented indicating that these disorders might be prevented by delaying the introduction of letter writing until the age of 8 years. Early childhood speech categorization in children genetically at-risk of developing Dyslexia_HP is also considered from this perspective. Convergent support for this premature writing hypothesis is provided by a comparison with the development of the Left_HP-hand inverted writing posture.

Rapid Naming and Phonemic Awareness in Children With or Without Reading Disabilities and/or ADHD.Employing a large sample of children from Dutch regular elementary schools, this study assessed the contributing and discriminating values of Dyslexia_HP (RD) and attention-deficit/Hyperactivity_HP disorder (ADHD) to two types of phonological processing skills, phonemic awareness (PA) and rapid automatized naming (RAN). A second objective was to investigate whether comorbidity of RD and ADHD should be considered as an additive phenomenon as to RAN and PA. A total of 1,262 children, aged 8 to 13 years, were classified as RD ( n = 121), ADHD ( n = 17), comorbid (RD+ADHD; n = 16), or control ( n = 1,108). Phonological processing was assessed by standardized tests of PA and RAN. Disability groups were compared to each other and contrasted to the control group. Although results indicate substantial effects for all three disability groups on both types of phonological processing, and the RAN/PA compound measure in particular, effect sizes were considerably larger for the RD groups, as compared to the ADHD-only group. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

Present and past: Can writing abilities in school children be associated with their auditory discrimination capacities in infancy?Literacy acquisition is highly associated with auditory processing abilities, such as auditory discrimination. The event-related potential Mismatch Response (MMR) is an indicator for cortical auditory discrimination abilities and it has been found to be reduced in individuals with Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO impairments and also in infants at risk for these impairments. The goal of the present study was to analyze the relationship between auditory speech discrimination in infancy and writing abilities at school age within subjects, and to determine when auditory speech discrimination differences, relevant for later writing abilities, start to develop. We analyzed the MMR registered in response to natural syllables in German children with and without writing problems at two points during development, that is, at school age and at infancy, namely at age 1 month and 5 months. We observed MMR related auditory discrimination differences between infants with and without later writing problems, starting to develop at age 5 months-an age when infants begin to establish language-specific phoneme representations. At school age, these children with and without writing problems also showed auditory discrimination differences, reflected in the MMR, confirming a relationship between writing and auditory speech processing skills. Thus, writing problems at school age are, at least, partly grounded in auditory discrimination problems developing already during the first months of life.

Facial speech Gestures_ASDPTO: the relation between visual speech processing, phonological awareness, and developmental Dyslexia_HP in 10-year-olds.Successful communication in everyday life crucially involves the processing of auditory and visual components of speech. Viewing our interlocutor and processing visual components of speech facilitates speech processing by triggering auditory processing. Auditory phoneme processing, analyzed by event-related brain potentials (ERP), has been shown to be associated with impairments in reading and spelling (i.e. developmental Dyslexia_HP), but visual aspects of phoneme processing have not been investigated in individuals with such deficits. The present study analyzed the passive visual Mismatch Response (vMMR) in school children with and without developmental Dyslexia_HP in response to video-recorded mouth movements pronouncing syllables silently. Our results reveal that both groups of children showed processing of visual speech stimuli, but with different scalp distribution. Children without developmental Dyslexia_HP showed a vMMR with typical posterior distribution. In contrast, children with developmental Dyslexia_HP showed a vMMR with anterior distribution, which was even more pronounced in children with Severe_HP phonological deficits and very low spelling abilities. As anterior scalp distributions are typically reported for auditory speech processing, the anterior vMMR of children with developmental Dyslexia_HP might suggest an attempt to anticipate potentially upcoming auditory speech information in order to support phonological processing, which has been shown to be deficient in children with developmental Dyslexia_HP.

Implicit learning of non-linguistic and linguistic regularities in children with Dyslexia_HP.One of the hallmarks of Dyslexia_HP is the failure to automatise written patterns despite repeated exposure to print. Although many explanations have been proposed to explain this problem, researchers have recently begun to explore the possibility that an underlying implicit learning deficit may play a role in Dyslexia_HP. This hypothesis has been investigated through non-linguistic tasks exploring implicit learning in a general domain. In this study, we examined the abilities of children with Dyslexia_HP to implicitly acquire positional regularities embedded in both non-linguistic and linguistic stimuli. In experiment 1, 42 children (21 with Dyslexia_HP and 21 typically developing) were exposed to rule-governed shape sequences; whereas in experiment 2, a new group of 42 children were exposed to rule-governed letter strings. Implicit learning was assessed in both experiments via a forced-choice task. Experiments 1 and 2 showed a similar pattern of results. ANOVA analyses revealed no significant differences between the dyslexic and the typically developing group, indicating that children with Dyslexia_HP are not impaired in the acquisition of simple positional regularities, regardless of the nature of the stimuli. However, within group t-tests suggested that children from the dyslexic group could not transfer the underlying positional rules to novel instances as efficiently as typically developing children.

[Cognitive and linguistic abilities of a boy with PVL showing relatively higher VIQ compared to PIQ].In this study, we investigated the cognitive processing and language abilities of a 13-year-old boy with Moderate_HP Periventricular_leukomalacia_HP (PVL), Spastic_diplegia_HP and Exotropia_HP who had discrepant scores in the verbal intelligence quotient (VIQ) and performance intelligence quotient (PIQ) in the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, third edition (VIQ; 82 > PIQ; under 40). In the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children and Das-Naglieri Cognitive Assessment System, his performance was poor at simultaneous processing compared to sequential processing. He could not copy three-dimensional figures, and he could place only two out of eight blocks correctly in the second level models of Benton three-dimensional block construction test, showing visuospatial impairment typical of patients with PVL. Despite the relatively high score in VIQ, there was a gap among the scores of the subtests in the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities. He tended to get low scores in tests that required visual abilities. In addition, there was also an impairment in reading fluency tested by the Diagnostic Criteria and Medical Guideline for Specific Developmental Disorders. He was much less fluent in reading syllables, words or sentences (6.0 SD or more compared to 12-year-old boys). The relatively higher score in VIQ superficially suggests adequate Language_Ability_ASDPTO. However, in the present study, precise investigation revealed some discrepancies even within the field of language. Thus, defining stronger and weaker points of a patient is important in order to determine optimal medical or educational approaches.

Intact crowding and temporal masking in Dyslexia_HP.Phonological deficits in Dyslexia_HP are well documented. However, there is an ongoing discussion about whether visual deficits limit the reading skills of people with Dyslexia_HP. Here, we investigated visual crowding and backward masking. We presented a Vernier (i.e., two vertical bars slightly offset to the Left_HP or Right_HP) and asked observers to indicate the offset direction. Vernier stimuli are visually similar to letters and are strongly Affected_HP by crowding, even in the fovea. To increase task difficulty, Verniers are often followed by a mask (i.e., backward masking). We measured Vernier offset discrimination thresholds for the basic Vernier task, under crowding, and under backward masking, in students with Dyslexia_HP (n = 19) and age and intelligence matched students (n = 27). We found no group differences in any of these conditions. Controls with fast visual processing (good backward masking performance), were faster readers. By contrast, no such correlation was found among the students with Dyslexia_HP, suggesting that backward masking does not limit their reading efficiency. These findings indicate that neither elevated crowding nor elevated backward masking pose a bottleneck to reading skills of people with Dyslexia_HP.

Neurocognitive Development and Predictors of L1 and L2 Literacy Skills in Dyslexia_HP: A Longitudinal Study of Children 5-11 Years Old.The aim of this study was to find valid neurocognitive precursors of literacy development in first language (L1, Norwegian) and second language (L2, English) in a group of children during their Pre-literacy, Emergent Literacy and Literacy stages, by comparing children with Dyslexia_HP and a typical group. Children who were 5 years old at project start were followed until the age of 11, when Dyslexia_HP was identified and data could be analysed in retrospect. The children's neurocognitive pattern changed both by literacy stage and domain. Visuo-spatial recall and RAN appeared as early precursors of L1 literacy, while phonological awareness appeared as early precursor of L2 English. Verbal long term memory was associated with both L1 and L2 skills in the Literacy stage. Significant group differences seen in the Pre-literacy and Emergent literacy stages decreased in the Literacy stage. The developmental variations by stage and domain may explain some of the inconsistencies seen in Dyslexia_HP research. Early identification and training are essential to avoid academic failure, and our data show that visuo-spatial memory and RAN could be suitable early markers in transparent orthographies like Norwegian. Phonological awareness was here seen as an early precursor of L2 English, but not of L1 Norwegian.

[Prosody_ASDPTO and reading: Temporal and melodic characteristics in the dyslexic child in reading and narration].Dyslexia_HP is widely associated to a massive phonological awareness deficit. This deficit leads to difficulties in grapheme to phoneme conversions in reading and difficulties in words and sentences productions. The origin of the phonological deficit is partially explained by the magnocellular, cerebellar and articulatory theories. Recently, an increasing number of studies demonstrated the relationship between Prosody_ASDPTO and reading and, more specifically, the potential key role of suprasegmental phonology in the Healthy_HP development of phonological representations. The aim of this study is to explore part of prosodic features in dyslexics and normal developing children in reading and narration tasks, in French. We examined reading accuracy, reading rate, pauses Frequency_HP and duration, inter-pausal units (IPUs) duration and instantaneous variations of F0. Results show correct decoding skills for all subjects but a lack of automation of this procedure for dyslexics. Differences in pauses Frequency_HP and duration, IPUS duration and F0 variations observed between dyslexics and controls confirm the link between prosodic reading and automaticity. The longer pause duration in narrative form a temporal feature of dyslexic's production. This temporal characteristic reflects the cognitive cost done by a speech generation task involving lexical selection, syntactic Planning_ASDPTO and articulatory programming processes. This result is a first step towards evidence of a suprasegmental phonological deficit in spoken language that could be an early marker of later reading difficulties.

The Foundations of Literacy Development in Children at Familial Risk of Dyslexia_HP.The development of reading skills is underpinned by oral language abilities: Phonological skills appear to have a causal influence on the development of early word-level literacy skills, and reading-comprehension ability depends, in addition to word-level literacy skills, on broader (semantic and syntactic) language skills. Here, we report a longitudinal study of children at familial risk of Dyslexia_HP, children with preschool language difficulties, and typically developing control children. Preschool measures of oral language predicted phoneme awareness and grapheme-phoneme knowledge just before school entry, which in turn predicted word-level literacy skills shortly after school entry. Reading comprehension at 8½ years was predicted by word-level literacy skills at 5½ years and by language skills at 3½ years. These patterns of predictive relationships were similar in both typically developing children and those at risk of literacy difficulties. Our findings underline the importance of oral language skills for the development of both word-level literacy and reading comprehension.

Childhood Language_impairment_HP and Social_Anxiety_ASDPTO_ASDPTO in Early Adulthood.Language_impairment_HP is associated with Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP and with social problems in childhood and adolescence. However, the relation between Language_impairment_HP and adult Social_Anxiety_ASDPTO_ASDPTO is not well known. This study examines Social_Anxiety_ASDPTO_ASDPTO in early adulthood in a 26-year prospective longitudinal study following individuals identified with a communication disorder at age 5 and a control group. Social_Anxiety_ASDPTO_ASDPTO diagnoses and subthreshold symptoms were examined at ages 19, 25, and 31 using a structured diagnostic interview; Social_Anxiety_ASDPTO_ASDPTO symptoms related to social interaction and social performance were also assessed dimensionally at age 31. Multiple imputation was used to address attrition. Compared to controls, participants with childhood Language_impairment_HP had higher rates of subthreshold social phobia at ages 19 and 25 and endorsed higher levels of social interaction Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP symptoms at age 31, with particular difficulty talking to others and asserting their perspectives. Childhood Language_impairment_HP is a specific risk factor for a circumscribed set of Social_Anxiety_ASDPTO_ASDPTO symptoms in adulthood, which are likely associated with communication challenges.

The Colorado Longitudinal Twin Study of Reading Difficulties and ADHD: Etiologies of Comorbidity and Stability.Approximately 60% of children with reading difficulties (RD) meet criteria for at least one co-occurring disorder. The most common of these, Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_HP (ADHD), occurs in 20-40% of individuals with RD. Recent studies have suggested that genetic influences are responsible. To assess the genetic etiologies of RD and the comorbidity of RD and two ADHD symptom dimensions -- inattention (IN) and Hyperactivity_HP/Impulsivity_HP (H/I) -- we are conducting the first longitudinal twin study of RD and ADHD. Data from twin pairs in which at least one member of the pair met criteria for proband status for RD at initial assessment, and were reassessed 5 years later, were subjected to DeFries-Fulker (DF) analysis. Analyses of reading composite data indicated that over 60% of the proband deficit at initial assessment was due to genetic influences, and that reading deficits at follow-up were due substantially to the same genetic influences. When a bivariate DF model was fitted to reading performance and IN data, genetic influences accounted for 60% of contemporaneous comorbidity and over 60% of the longitudinal relationship. In contrast, analysis of the comorbidity between reading performance and H/I indicated that common genetic influences accounted for only about 20% of the contemporaneous and about 10% of the longitudinal relationships. Results indicate that (1) genetic influences on RD are substantial and highly Stable_HP; (2) the comorbidity between RD and IN is due largely to genetic influences, both contemporaneously and longitudinally; and (3) genetic influences contribute significantly less to the comorbidity between RD and H/I.

Dyslexia_HP-Early Identification and Prevention: Highlights from the Jyväskylä Longitudinal Study of Dyslexia_HP.Over two decades of Finnish research, monitoring children born with risk for Dyslexia_HP has been carried out in the Jyväskylä Longitudinal Study of Dyslexia_HP (JLD). Two hundred children, half at risk, have been assessed from birth to puberty on hundreds of measures. The aims were to identify measures of prediction of later reading difficulty and to instigate appropriate and earliest Diagnosis_ASDPTO and intervention. We can identify at-risk children from newborn electroencephalographic brain recordings (Guttorm et al., J Neural Transm 110:1059-1074, 2003). Predictors are also apparent from late-talking infants who have familial background of Dyslexia_HP (Lyytinen and Lyytinen, Appl Psycolinguistics 25:397-411, 2004). The earliest easy-to-use predictive measure to identify children who need help to avoid difficulties in learning to read is letter knowledge (Lyytinen et al., Merrill-Palmer Q 52:514-546, 2006).

Behavioral and Neuroimaging Research of Reading: a Case of Japanese.Behavioral studies showed that AS, an English-Japanese bilingual, was a skilled reader in Japanese but was a phonological dyslexic in English. This behavioral dissociation was accounted for by the Hypothesis of Transparency and Granularity postulated by Wydell and Butterworth. However, a neuroimaging study using magnetoencephalography (MEG) revealed that AS has the same functional deficit in the Left_HP superior temporal gyrus (STG). This paper therefore offers an answer to this intriguing discrepancy between the

Spatial attention and reading ability: ERP correlates of flanker and cue-size effects in good and poor adult phonological decoders.To investigate facilitatory and inhibitory processes during selective attention among adults with good (n=17) and poor (n=14) phonological decoding skills, a go/nogo flanker task was completed while EEG was recorded. Participants responded to a middle target letter flanked by compatible or incompatible flankers. The target was surrounded by a small or large circular cue which was presented simultaneously or 500ms prior. Poor decoders showed a greater RT cost for incompatible stimuli preceded by large cues and less RT benefit for compatible stimuli. Poor decoders also showed reduced modulation of ERPs by cue-size at Left_HP hemisphere posterior sites (N1) and by flanker compatibility at Right_HP hemisphere posterior sites (N1) and frontal sites (N2), consistent with processing differences in fronto-parietal attention networks. These findings have potential implications for understanding the relationship between spatial attention and phonological decoding in Dyslexia_HP.

Visual processing in reading disorders and attention-deficit/Hyperactivity_HP disorder and its contribution to basic reading ability.Whether visual processing deficits are common in reading disorders (RD), and related to reading ability in general, has been debated for decades. The type of visual processing Affected_HP also is debated, although visual discrimination and short-term memory (STM) may be more commonly related to reading ability. Reading disorders are frequently comorbid with ADHD, and children with ADHD often have subclinical reading problems. Hence, children with ADHD were used as a comparison group in this study. ADHD and RD may be dissociated in terms of visual processing. Whereas RD may be associated with deficits in visual discrimination and STM for order, ADHD is associated with deficits in visual-spatial processing. Thus, we hypothesized that children with RD would perform worse than controls and children with ADHD only on a measure of visual discrimination and a measure of visual STM that requires memory for order. We expected all groups would perform comparably on the measure of visual STM that does not require sequential processing. We found children with RD or ADHD were commensurate to controls on measures of visual discrimination and visual STM that do not require sequential processing. In contrast, both RD groups (RD, RD/ADHD) performed worse than controls on the measure of visual STM that requires memory for order, and children with comorbid RD/ADHD performed worse than those with ADHD. In addition, of the three visual measures, only sequential visual STM predicted reading ability. Hence, our findings suggest there is a deficit in visual sequential STM that is specific to RD and is related to basic reading ability. The source of this deficit is worthy of further research, but it may include both reduced memory for order and poorer verbal mediation.

Investigating the Influences of Delayed_speech_and_language_development_HP and/or Familial Risk for Dyslexia_HP on Brain Structure in 5-Year-Olds.Early Delayed_speech_and_language_development_HP has often been associated with atypical language/literacy development. Neuroimaging studies further indicate functional disruptions during language and print processing in school-age children with a retrospective report of early Delayed_speech_and_language_development_HP. Behavioral data of 114 5-year-olds with a retrospective report of early Delayed_speech_and_language_development_HP in infancy (N = 34) and those without (N = 80) and with a familial risk for Dyslexia_HP and those without are presented. Behaviorally, children with a retrospective report of early Delayed_speech_and_language_development_HP exhibited reduced performance in language/reading-related measures. A voxel-based morphometry analysis in a subset (N = 46) demonstrated an association between reduced gray matter volume and early Delayed_speech_and_language_development_HP in Left_HP-hemispheric middle temporal, occipital, and frontal regions. Alterations in middle temporal cortex in children with a retrospective report of early Delayed_speech_and_language_development_HP were observed regardless of familial risk for Dyslexia_HP. Additionally, while children with isolated familial risk for Dyslexia_HP showed gray matter reductions in temporoparietal and occipitotemporal regions, these effects were most Profound_HP in children with both risk factors. An interaction effect of early Delayed_speech_and_language_development_HP and familial risk was revealed in temporoparietal, occipital, and frontal cortex. Our findings support a cumulative effect of early behavioral and genetic risk factors on brain development and may ultimately inform Diagnosis_ASDPTO/treatment.

Amblyopic children read more slowly than controls under natural, binocular reading conditions.Recent evidence suggests that Amblyopia_HP results in fixation instability and atypical saccades. Reading is a vision-reliant ability that requires sequential eye movements, including forward and regressive saccades. This study investigated reading and associated eye movements in school-age amblyopic children.

Lexical and sub-lexical reading skills and their correlation to clinical symptoms in young Chinese patients with Schizophrenia_HP.Patients with Schizophrenia_HP often experience Severe_HP reading deficits such as oral reading and reading comprehension deficits. However, it is not known whether different types of lexical or sub-lexical components in reading are also impaired. In order to address this issue, the present study had 22 young Chinese patients with Schizophrenia_HP and 22 young Chinese normal controls undergo a battery of reading tests, which specifically measures lexical and sub-lexical components of reading in Chinese. The schizophrenic group further underwent Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) in order to ascertain the Severity_HP of patients' clinical symptoms. The results showed that compared to the controls, (1) the schizophrenic patients performed significantly poorly in orthographic processing, orthography-phonology mapping, and orthography-semantic mapping tests and further that (2) their performances in orthographic processing, and orthography-semantic mapping skill tests negatively correlated with the BPRS score. Note however that their ability to access their mental lexicon was intact. There is thus a clear need for studies with a larger sample-size and neurobiological measures which would lead to our better understanding of the behavioral as well as the neural relationships between schizophrenic patients, and their reading processing impairments, thus developing effective reading intervention programs for the schizophrenic patients.

A Randomized Controlled Trial on The Beneficial Effects of Training Letter-Speech Sound Integration on Reading Fluency in Children with Dyslexia_HP.A recent account of Dyslexia_HP assumes that a failure to develop automated letter-speech sound integration might be responsible for the observed lack of reading fluency. This study uses a pre-test-training-post-test design to evaluate the effects of a training program based on letter-speech sound associations with a special focus on gains in reading fluency. A sample of 44 children with Dyslexia_HP and 23 typical readers, aged 8 to 9, was recruited. Children with Dyslexia_HP were randomly allocated to either the training program group (n = 23) or a waiting-list control group (n = 21). The training intensively focused on letter-speech sound mapping and consisted of 34 individual sessions of 45 minutes over a five month period. The children with Dyslexia_HP showed substantial reading gains for the main word reading and spelling measures after training, improving at a faster rate than typical readers and waiting-list controls. The results are interpreted within the conceptual framework assuming a multisensory integration deficit as the most Proximal_HP cause of dysfluent reading in Dyslexia_HP.

Print-Tuning Lateralization and Handedness: an Event-Related Potential Study in Dyslexic Higher Education Students.Despite their ample reading experience, higher education students with Dyslexia_HP still show deficits in reading and reading-related skills. Lateralized print tuning, the early sensitivity to print of the Left_HP parietal cortex signalled by the N1 event-related potential (ERP) component, differs between beginning dyslexic readers and controls. For adults, the findings are mixed. The present study aims to investigate whether print tuning, as indexed by the N1 component, differs between 24 students with Dyslexia_HP and 15 non-dyslexic controls. Because handedness has been linked to lateralization, first, a separate analysis was conducted including only Right_HP-handed participants (n = 12 in both groups), like in most previous studies. ERPs were measured during a judgement task, requiring visual, phonological, or semantic judgments. In both groups, the N1 was earlier and stronger in the Left_HP than in the Right_HP hemisphere. However, when only strongly Right_HP-handed participants were evaluated, the N1 was less Left_HP-lateralized for participants with Dyslexia_HP as compared with controls. Participants with Dyslexia_HP had longer reaction times during the ERP experiment and performed worse on many reading (-related) tasks. These findings suggest that abnormal print tuning can still be found among higher education students with Dyslexia_HP and that handedness should be regarded in the study of print tuning.

Because handedness has been linked to lateralization, first, a separate analysis was conducted including only right-handed participants (n = 12 in both groups), like in most previous studies. ERPs were measured during a judgement task, requiring visual, phonological, or semantic judgments. In both groups, the N1 was earlier and stronger in the left than in the right hemisphere. However, when only strongly right-handed participants were evaluated, the N1 was less left-lateralized for participants with dyslexia as compared with controls. Participants with dyslexia had longer reaction times during the ERP experiment and performed worse on many reading (-related) tasks. These findings suggest that abnormal print tuning can still be found among higher education students with dyslexia and that handedness should be regarded in the study of print tuning.
Lifelong Reading Disorder and Mild_HP Cognitive_impairment_HP: Implications for Diagnosis_ASDPTO.Although neuropsychological tests are commonly used in the evaluation of possible Mild_HP Cognitive_impairment_HP (MCI), poor test scores may be indicative of factors other than neurological compromise. The current study assessed the role of lifelong reading disorder on MCI classification. Community dwelling older adults with a suspected developmental reading disorder were identified by inference based on reading test performance. Individuals with a suspected reading disorder were significantly more likely to perform at a level consistent with MCI on several commonly used neuropsychological tests. The findings suggest a relationship between a history of reading disorder and MCI classification.

Abnormality_of_the_cerebral_white_matter_HP in Infants at Risk for Developmental Dyslexia_HP.Developmental Dyslexia_HP (DD) is a heritable condition characterized by persistent difficulties in learning to read. Abnormality_of_the_cerebral_white_matter_HP in Left_HP-lateralized language areas, particularly in the arcuate fasciculus (AF), have been observed in DD, and diffusion properties within the AF correlate with (pre-)reading skills as early as kindergarten. However, it is unclear how early these alterations can be observed. We investigated white matter structure in 14 infants with (FHD+; ages 6.6-17.6 months) and 18 without (FHD-; ages 5.1-17.6 months) familial risk for DD. Diffusion scans were acquired during natural sleep, and early language skills were assessed. Tractography for Bilateral_HP AF was reconstructed using manual and automated methods, allowing for independent validation of results. Fractional anisotropy (FA) was calculated at multiple nodes along the tracts for more precise localization of group differences. The analyses revealed significantly lower FA in the Left_HP AF for FHD+ compared with FHD- infants, particularly in the Central_HP portion of the tract. Moreover, Expressive_Language_ASDPTO positively correlated with FA across groups. Our results demonstrate that atypical brain development associated with DD is already present within the first 18 months of life, suggesting that the deficits associated with DD may result from altered structural connectivity in Left_HP-hemispheric regions.

Time-based prospective memory in adults with developmental Dyslexia_HP.Prospective memory (PM) is memory for delayed intentions. Despite its importance to everyday life, the few studies on PM function in adults with Dyslexia_HP which exist have relied on self-report measures. To determine whether self-reported PM deficits can be measured objectively, laboratory-based PM tasks were administered to 24 adults with Dyslexia_HP and 25 age- and IQ-matched adults without Dyslexia_HP. Self-report data indicated that people with Dyslexia_HP felt that time-based PM (TBPM; requiring responses at certain times in the future) was most problematic for them and so this form of PM was the focus of investigation. Whilst performing the ongoing task from which they were required to break out every 3 min to make a PM-related response, the participants were allowed to make clock checks whenever they wished. The cognitive demands made on ongoing behaviour were manipulated to determine whether loading executive resources had a mediating role in Dyslexia_HP-related deficits in PM, resulting in three tasks with varying Working_Memory_ASDPTO load. A semi-naturalistic TBPM task was also administered, in which the participants were asked to remind the experimenter to save a data file 40 min after being given this instruction. Dyslexia_HP-related differences were found across all three computerized tasks, regardless of cognitive load. The adults with Dyslexia_HP made fewer correct PM responses and also fewer clock checks. On the semi-naturalistic task, the participants with Dyslexia_HP were less likely to remember to remind the experimenter to save the file. This is the first study to document PM deficits in Dyslexia_HP using objective measures of performance. Since TBPM impairments were found under more naturalistic conditions as well as on computerized tasks, the results have implications for workplace support for adults with Dyslexia_HP.

Diverging receptive and expressive word processing mechanisms in a deep dyslexic reader.We report on KJ, a patient with acquired Dyslexia_HP due to cerebral artery infarction. He represents an unusually clear case of an "output" deep dyslexic reader, with a distinct pattern of pure semantic reading. According to current neuropsychological models of reading, the Severity_HP of this condition is directly related to the degree of impairment in semantic and phonological representations and the resulting Postural_instability_HP in the interaction between the two word processing pathways. The present work sought to examine whether an innovative eye movement supported intervention combining lexical and segmental therapy would strengthen phonological processing and lead to an attenuation of the extreme semantic over-involvement in KJ's word identification process. Reading performance was assessed before (T1) between (T2) and after (T3) therapy using both analyses of linguistic errors and word viewing patterns. Therapy resulted in improved reading aloud accuracy along with a change in error distribution that suggested a return to more sequential reading. Interestingly, this was in contrast to the dynamics of moment-to-moment word processing, as eye movement analyses still suggested a predominantly holistic strategy, even at T3. So, in addition to documenting the success of the therapeutic intervention, our results call for a theoretically important conclusion: Real-time letter and word recognition routines should be considered separately from properties of the verbal output. Combining both perspectives may provide a promising strategy for future assessment and therapy evaluation.

The regulatory element READ1 epistatically influences reading and language, with both deleterious and protective alleles.Dyslexia_HP (RD) and Language_impairment_HP (LI) are heritable learning disabilities that obstruct acquisition and use of written and spoken language, respectively. We previously reported that two risk haplotypes, each in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with an allele of READ1, a polymorphic compound short tandem repeat within intron 2 of risk gene DCDC2, are associated with RD and LI. Additionally, we showed a non-additive genetic interaction between READ1 and KIAHap, a previously reported risk haplotype in risk gene KIAA0319, and that READ1 binds the transcriptional regulator ETV6.

Predicting Dyslexia_HP using prereading skills: the role of sensorimotor and cognitive abilities.It is well established that phonological awareness, print knowledge and rapid naming predict later reading difficulties. However, additional auditory, visual and motor difficulties have also been observed in dyslexic children. It is examined to what extent these difficulties can be used to predict later literacy difficulties.

Neuroanatomical anomalies of Dyslexia_HP: Disambiguating the effects of disorder, performance, and maturation.An increasing body of studies has revealed neuroanatomical impairments in developmental Dyslexia_HP. However, whether these structural anomalies are driven by Dyslexia_HP (disorder-specific effects), absolute reading performance (performance-dependent effects), and/or further influenced by age (maturation-sensitive effects) remains elusive. To help disentangle these sources, the current study used a novel disorder (Dyslexia_HP vs. control) by maturation (younger vs. older) factorial design in 48 Chinese children who were carefully matched. This design not only allows for direct comparison between dyslexics versus controls matched for chronological age and reading ability, but also enables examination of the influence of maturation and its interaction with Dyslexia_HP. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) showed that dyslexic children had reduced regional gray matter volume in the Left_HP temporo-parietal cortex (spanning over Heschl's gyrus, planum temporale and supramarginal gyrus), middle frontal gyrus, superior occipital gyrus, and reduced regional white matter in Bilateral_HP parieto-occipital regions (Left_HP cuneus and Right_HP precuneus) compared with both age-matched and reading-level matched controls. Therefore, maturational stage-invariant neurobiological signatures of Dyslexia_HP were found in brain regions that have been associated with impairments in the auditory/phonological and attentional systems. On the other hand, maturational stage-dependent effects on Dyslexia_HP were observed in three regions (Left_HP ventral occipito-temporal cortex, Left_HP dorsal pars opercularis and genu of the corpus callosum), all of which were previously reported to be involved in fluent reading and its development. These striking dissociations collectively suggest potential atypical developmental trajectories of Dyslexia_HP, where underlying mechanisms are currently unknown but may be driven by interactions between genetic and/or environmental factors. In summary, this is the first study to disambiguate maturational stage on neuroanatomical anomalies of Dyslexia_HP in addition to the effects of disorder, reading performance and maturational stage on neuroanatomical anomalies of Dyslexia_HP, despite the limitation of a relatively small sample-size. These results will hopefully encourage future research to place greater emphasis on taking a developmental perspective to Dyslexia_HP, which may, in turn, further our understanding of the etiological basis of this neurodevelopmental disorder, and ultimately optimize early identification and remediation.

Predictability effect on N400 reflects the Severity_HP of reading comprehension deficits in Aphasia_HP.Predictability effect on N400, in which low predictability words elicited a larger N400 than high predictability words did over Central_HP to posterior electrodes, has been used to index difficulty of lexical retrieval and semantic integration of words in sentence comprehension. This study examined predictability effect on N400 in aphasic patients to determine if the properties of N400 are suited to indexing the Severity_HP of reading comprehension deficits. Patients with Aphasia_HP were divided into high and low ability groups based on scores on the reading comprehension subtest in the Chinese Concise Aphasia_HP Test (CCAT). The two Aphasia_HP groups, a group of Healthy_HP elders who were age-matched to the aphasic participants, and a group of young adults, were requested to read sentences that either ended with highly predictable words or unexpected but plausible words, while undergoing electroencephalography (EEG). The young adult and Healthy_HP elderly groups exhibited the typical centro-parietal distributed effect of predictability on N400; however, Healthy_HP elders exhibited a reduced N400 effect in a delayed time window compared to the young adults. Compared with the elderly control, the high ability Aphasia_HP group exhibited a comparable N400 effect in a more restricted time window; by contrast, the low ability Aphasia_HP group exhibited a frontal distributed N400 in a much later time window (400-700 ms). These data suggest that the Severity_HP of reading comprehension deficits affects predictability effect on a set of N400 characteristics (i.e., amplitude, time window, and topographic distribution), which may be effective as ERP signatures in the evaluation of language recovery in Aphasia_HP.

Development of phonological awareness in Down_Syndrome_ASDPTO: A meta-analysis and empirical study.Phonological awareness (PA) is the knowledge and understanding of the sound structure of language and is believed to be an important skill for the development of reading. This study explored PA skills in children with Down_Syndrome_ASDPTO and matched typically developing (TD) controls using a dual approach: a meta-analysis of the existing international literature and a longitudinal empirical study. The results from both the meta-analysis and the empirical study showed that the children with Down_Syndrome_ASDPTO initially had weaker PA skills compared to the controls; in particular, the awareness of rhyme was delayed. The longitudinal empirical data indicated that, as a result of formal education, the children with Down_Syndrome_ASDPTO exhibited greater improvement on all PA measures compared with the controls who had not yet entered school. The results reach significance for rhyme awareness. With respect to dimensionality, the performance of the children with Down_Syndrome_ASDPTO loaded on 1 factor, whereas the performance of the younger TD controls was multidimensional. In sum, these findings underline the need for studies that compare interventions designed especially to stimulate development of PA in this group of children and to provide insight into the underlying causes of the developmental profile of children with Down_Syndrome_ASDPTO.

Prefixes repel stress in reading aloud: Evidence from surface Dyslexia_HP.This study examined the importance of prefixes as sublexical cues for stress assignment during reading aloud English disyllabic words. In particular, we tested the hypothesis that prefixes repel stress (Rastle & Coltheart, 2000) by investigating the likelihood with which patients with surface Dyslexia_HP assign second-syllable stress to prefixed words. Five such patients were presented with three types of disyllabic words for reading aloud: 'regular' prefixed words with weak-strong stress pattern (e.g., remind); 'irregular' prefixed words with strong-weak stress pattern (e.g., reflex); and non-prefixed words with strong-weak stress pattern (e.g., scandal). Results showed that all five patients frequently regularized the strong-weak prefixed words by pronouncing them with second syllable stress. These regularization errors provide strong evidence for the functional role of prefixes in stress assignment during reading. Additional computational simulations using the rule-based algorithm for pronouncing disyllables developed by Rastle and Coltheart (2000) and the CDP++ model of reading aloud (Perry et al., 2010) allowed us to evaluate how these two opponent approaches to reading aloud fare in respect of the patient data.

Does Growth in the Executive System of Working_Memory_ASDPTO Underlie Growth in Literacy for Bilingual Children With and Without Reading Disabilities?This cohort-sequential study explored the components of Working_Memory_ASDPTO (WM) that underlie second language (L2) reading growth in 450 children at risk and not at risk for reading disabilities (RD) whose first language is Spanish. English language learners designated as balanced and nonbalanced bilinguals with and without risk for RD in Grades 1, 2, and 3 at Wave 1 were administered a battery of cognitive (short-term memory, WM, naming speed, and inhibition), vocabulary, and reading measures in Spanish and English. These same measures were administered 1 and 2 years later. Two important findings occurred: First, growth in the WM executive component was significantly related to growth in English word identification and passage comprehension when competing measures (phonological processing, naming speed, inhibition, and fluid intelligence) were entered into the multilevel growth model. Second, children defined as at risk for RD in Wave 1 had lower intercepts than children not at risk at Wave 3 across several measures of cognition, language, and achievement. However, except on measures of the executive component of WM, no significant group differences in linear growth emerged. These findings suggest that growth in L2 reading was tied to growth in the executive system of WM.

[A girl with Dyslexia_HP suspected to have Irlen syndrome, completely relieved by wearing tinted lenses].Irlen syndrome is a proposed perceptual processing disorder characterized by visual distortions while reading. Patients with this syndrome may experience light sensitivity, visual stress, and other related problems such as Dyslexia_HP. Tinted lenses and colored overlays have been designed to help individuals with the symptoms of Irlen syndrome. However, there is still debate over the effectiveness of these interventions and whether this syndrome actually exists. In this report, we describe a case involving an 8-year-old girl with Dyslexia_HP who experienced Severe_HP visual hypersensitivity and whose symptoms completely resolved after wearing tinted lenses. While it is possible that she experienced a psychogenic visual disturbance that was relieved because of the placebo effect, the Clinical_course_HP of her symptoms matched the findings previously described by Irlen. The patient was unable to read without tinted lenses. With tinted lenses, she could read at the appropriate age level, suggesting that her difficulty was due to a problem in optical information processing. The concepts underlying Irlen syndrome are vaguely defined, and several groups insist that the visual stress associated with this syndrome might be responsible for Dyslexia_HP as well as other disorders. These ambiguous criteria may be responsible for the criticism over the validity of this condition. Although this was only an anecdotal case, our patient exhibited the core functional deficit described in Irlen syndrome and showed a dramatic improvement with tinted lenses; therefore, this case may facilitate investigations into the mechanism underlying Irlen syndrome, if it actually exists. Although further studies are required to confirm the validity of this syndrome and the treatment approach, Irlen syndrome should be recognized as a disorder since its symptoms can be easily relieved by wearing tinted lenses or color filters.
[A girl with dyslexia suspected to have Irlen syndrome, completely relieved by wearing tinted lenses].Irlen syndrome is a proposed perceptual processing disorder characterized by visual distortions while reading. Patients with this syndrome may experience light sensitivity, visual stress, and other related problems such as dyslexia. Tinted lenses and colored overlays have been designed to help individuals with the symptoms of Irlen syndrome. However, there is still debate over the effectiveness of these interventions and whether this syndrome actually exists. In this report, we describe a case involving an 8-year-old girl with dyslexia who experienced severe visual hypersensitivity and whose symptoms completely resolved after wearing tinted lenses. While it is possible that she experienced a psychogenic visual disturbance that was relieved because of the placebo effect, the clinical course of her symptoms matched the findings previously described by Irlen.

Oral language deficits in familial Dyslexia_HP: A meta-analysis and review.This article reviews 95 publications (based on 21 independent samples) that have examined children at family risk of reading disorders. We report that children at family risk of Dyslexia_HP experience Delayed_speech_and_language_development_HP as infants and toddlers. In the preschool period, they have significant difficulties in phonological processes as well as with broader language skills and in acquiring the foundations of decoding skill (letter knowledge, phonological awareness and rapid automatized naming [RAN]). Findings are mixed with regard to auditory and Visual_Perception_ASDPTO: they do not appear subject to slow motor development, but lack of control for Comorbidities_ASDPTO confounds interpretation. Longitudinal studies of outcomes show that children at family risk who go on to fulfil criteria for Dyslexia_HP have more Severe_HP impairments in preschool language than those who are defined as normal readers, but the latter group do less well than controls. Similarly at school age, family risk of Dyslexia_HP is associated with significantly poor phonological awareness and literacy skills. Although there is no strong evidence that children at family risk are brought up in an environment that differs significantly from that of controls, their parents tend to have lower educational levels and read less frequently to themselves. Together, the findings suggest that a phonological processing deficit can be conceptualized as an endophenotype of Dyslexia_HP that increases the continuous risk of reading difficulties; in turn its impact may be moderated by protective factors.

Neuropsychological status of French children with developmental Dyslexia_HP and/or developmental coordination disorder: Are both necessarily worse than one?Developmental Dyslexia_HP (DD) and developmental coordination disorder (DCD) co-occur frequently, raising the underlying question of shared etiological bases. We investigated the cognitive profile of children with DD, children with DCD, and children with the dual association (DD + DCD) to determine the inherent characteristics of each disorder and explore the possible additional impact of co-morbidity on intellectual, attentional, and psychosocial functioning. The participants were 8- to 12-year-olds (20 DD, 22 DCD, and 23 DD + DCD). Cognitive abilities were assessed by the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - Fourth Edition (WISC-IV) and the Continuous Performance Test - Second Edition (CPT-II) and behavioral impairments were evaluated by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). No differences were found between the three groups on attention testing (CPT-II) or psychosocial characteristics (CBCL), but a higher percentage of DD + DCD children had pathological scores on psychosocial scales. Significant between-group differences were observed on Processing Speed Index scores and the block design and symbol search subtests, where DD children fared better than DCD children. No significant differences were evident between the co-morbid vs. the pure groups. Our results clearly show significant differences between children with DD only and children with DCD only. In particular, visuo-spatial disabilities and Heterogeneous_HP of intellectual profile seem to be good markers of DCD. However, it should be noted that despite these distinct and separate characteristics, a common cognitive profile (weaknesses and strengths) is likely shared by both neurodevelopmental disorders. Surprisingly, concerning co-morbidity, DD + DCD association is not associated with a decrease in intellectual or attentional capacities.

From Languishing Dyslexia_HP to Thriving Dyslexia_HP: Developing a New Conceptual Approach to Working with People with Dyslexia_HP.This is an account of personal narratives shared by several people with Dyslexia_HP. Most of these are presented in their original quotation format to provide personal accounts of the lives of people with Dyslexia_HP. In this paper the author shares her conversations with her participants. This paper provides an original conceptual model, which is currently been tested empirically. Dyslexia_HP affects the learning process in areas as such reading, and spelling. Conversely abilities or strengths can be seen in other areas, such as developing coping strategies to manage and overcome challenges. This research aims to adapt positive psychology techniques to support individuals with Dyslexia_HP. To develop positive psychology interventions, individuals will be helped to discover their five signature strengths. The VIA (Values in Action) Strengths Survey has been hosted in a website which has been developed in the form of a Dyslexia_HP user friendly format, such as providing the ability for respondents to change fonts and font sizes, colors and a text to speech option. This paper introduces the theoretical model of 'How to move from Languishing Dyslexia_HP to Thriving Dyslexia_HP.'

EEG-based time and spatial interpretation of activation areas for relaxation and words writing between poor and capable dyslexic children.Symptoms of Dyslexia_HP such as difficulties with accurate and/or fluent word recognition, and/or poor spelling as well as decoding abilities, are easily misinterpreted as laziness and defiance amongst school children. Indeed, 37.9% of 699 school dropouts and failures are diagnosed as dyslexic. Currently, Screening for Dyslexia_HP relies heavily on therapists, whom are few and subjective, yet objective methods are still unavailable. EEG has long been a popular method to study the cognitive processes in human such as language processing and motor activity. However, its interpretation is limited to time and Frequency_HP domain, without visual information, which is still useful. Here, our research intends to illustrate an EEG-based time and spatial interpretation of activated brain areas for the poor and capable dyslexic during the state of relaxation and words writing, being the first attempt ever reported. From the 2D distribution of EEG spectral at the activation areas and its progress with time, it is observed that capable dyslexics are able to relax compared to poor dyslexics. During the state of words writing, neural activities are found higher on the Right_HP hemisphere than the Left_HP hemisphere of the capable dyslexics, which suggests a neurobiological compensation pathway in the Right_HP hemisphere, during Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO, which is not observed in the poor dyslexics.

Low Frequency_HP overactivation in Dyslexia_HP: Evidence from resting state Magnetoencephalography.In this study, we compared the brain activation profiles obtained from resting state Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) activity in 15 dyslexic patients with the profiles of 15 normal controls, using power spectral density (PSD) analysis. We first estimated intracranial dipolar MEG sources on a dense grid on the cortical surface and then projected these sources on a standardized atlas with 68 regions of interest (ROIs). Averaging the PSD values of all sources in each ROI across all control subjects resulted in a normative database that was used to convert the PSD values of dyslexic patients into z-scores in eight distinct Frequency_HP bands. We found that dyslexic patients exhibited statistically significant overactivation in the delta band (0.1-4 Hz) in the Right_HP temporal (entorhinal and insula), Left_HP inferior frontal (Broca's area), and Right_HP inferior frontal regions. Overactivation may be interpreted as a compensatory mechanism for reading characterizing dyslexic patients. These findings suggest that resting-state MEG activation maps may be used as specific biomarkers that can help with the Diagnosis_ASDPTO of and assess the efficacy of intervention in Dyslexia_HP.

White matter and reading deficits after pediatric traumatic brain injury: A diffusion tensor imaging study.Pediatric traumatic brain injury often results in significant long-term deficits in mastery of reading ability. This study aimed to identify white matter pathways that, when damaged, predicted reading deficits in children. Based on the dual-route model of word reading, we predicted that integrity of the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus would be related to performance in sight word identification while integrity of the superior longitudinal fasciculus would be related to performance in phonemic decoding. Reading fluency and comprehension were hypothesized to relate to the superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and cingulum bundle. The connectivity of white matter pathways was used to predict reading deficits in children aged 6 to 16 years with traumatic brain injury (n = 29) and those with orthopedic injury (n = 27) using tract-based spatial statistics. Results showed that children with traumatic brain injury and reduced microstructural integrity of the superior longitudinal fasciculus demonstrated reduced word-reading ability on sight word and phonemic decoding tasks. Additionally, children with traumatic brain injury and microstructural changes involving the cingulum bundle demonstrated reduced reading fluency. Results support the association of a dorsal pathway via the superior longitudinal fasciculus with both sight word reading and phonemic decoding. No association was identified between the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and sight word reading or phonemic decoding. Reading fluency was associated with the integrity of the cingulum bundle. These findings support dissociable pathways predicting word reading and fluency using Diffusion Tensor Imaging and provide additional information for developing models of acquired reading deficits by specifying areas of brain damage which may predict reading deficits following recovery from the Acute_HP phase of TBI.

Relationships of Attention and Executive Functions to Oral Language, Reading, and Writing Skills and Systems in Middle Childhood and Early Adolescence.Relationships between attention/Executive_Function_ASDPTOs and language learning were investigated in students in Grades 4 to 9 ( N = 88) with and without specific learning disabilities (SLDs) in multiword syntax in oral and written language (OWL LD), word reading and spelling (Dyslexia_HP), and subword letter writing (Dysgraphia_HP). Prior attention-deficit/Hyperactivity_HP disorder (ADHD) Diagnosis_ASDPTO was correlated only with impaired handwriting. Parental ratings of inattention, but not Hyperactivity_HP, correlated with measures of written language but not oral language. Sustaining switching attention correlated with writing the alphabet from memory in manuscript or by keyboard and fast copying of a sentence with all the letters of the alphabet. Multiple regressions based on a principal component for composites of multiple levels of language (subword, word, and syntax/text) showed that measures of attention and Executive_Function_ASDPTO involving language processing rather than ratings of attention and Executive_Function_ASDPTO not specifically related to language accounted for more variance and identified more unique predictors in the composite outcomes for oral language, reading, and writing systems. Inhibition related to focused attention uniquely predicted outcomes for the oral language system. Findings are discussed in reference to implications for assessing and teaching students who are still learning to pay attention to heard and written language and self-regulate their language learning during middle childhood and adolescence.

Evaluation of the Bangor Dyslexia_HP Test (BDT) for use with Adults.The Bangor Dyslexia_HP Test (BDT) is a short, easy-to-administer screener for use with a broad age range, which has been in use in the UK for over three decades. A distinctive feature of the battery is its focus on skills requiring aspects of verbal and phonological processing without, however, measuring literacy skills per se. Despite its longstanding existence and usage, there has been no evaluation of the psychometric properties of the battery as an adult Dyslexia_HP screener. We examined the psychometric properties of the BDT and evaluated its capacity to discriminate between adults with and without Dyslexia_HP. A large archival sample of university students with Dyslexia_HP (n = 193) and students with no reported literacy difficulties (n = 40) were compared on the BDT as well as on literacy and cognitive measures. Statistical analyses revealed the BDT to be a reliable (α = .72) and valid Dyslexia_HP screening tool with the capacity to effectively identify adults at risk of the disorder with an overall classification rate of 94% (sensitivity 96.4% and specificity 82.5%). In addition, higher indices of Dyslexia_HP risk on the BDT were associated with lower scores on standardized measures of literacy.

Executive Functions Contribute Uniquely to Reading Competence in Minority Youth.Competent reading requires various skills beyond those for basic word reading (i.e., core language skills, rapid naming, phonological processing). Contributing "higher-level" or domain-general processes include information processing speed and executive functions (Working_Memory_ASDPTO, strategic problem solving, attentional switching). Research in this area has relied on largely Caucasian samples, with limited representation of children from racial or ethnic minority groups. This study examined contributions of executive skills to reading competence in 761 children of minority backgrounds. Hierarchical linear regressions examined unique contributions of executive functions (EF) to word reading, fluency, and comprehension. EF contributed uniquely to reading performance, over and above reading-related language skills; Working_Memory_ASDPTO contributed uniquely to all components of reading; while attentional switching, but not problem solving, contributed to isolated and contextual word reading and reading fluency. Problem solving uniquely predicted comprehension, suggesting that this skill may be especially important for reading comprehension in minority youth. Attentional switching may play a unique role in development of reading fluency in minority youth, perhaps as a result of the increased demand for switching between spoken versus written dialects. Findings have implications for educational and clinical practice with regard to reading instruction, remedial reading intervention, and assessment of individuals with reading difficulty.

Eye Movements and Articulations During a Letter Naming Speed Task.Naming speed (NS) refers to how quickly and accurately participants name a set of familiar stimuli (e.g., letters). NS is an established predictor of reading ability, but controversy remains over why it is related to reading. We used three techniques (stimulus manipulations to emphasize phonological and/or visual aspects, decomposition of NS times into pause and articulation components, and analysis of eye movements during Task_Performance_ASDPTO) with three groups of participants (children with Dyslexia_HP, ages 9-10; chronological-age [CA] controls, ages 9-10; reading-level [RL] controls, ages 6-7) to examine NS and the NS-reading relationship. Results indicated (a) for all groups, increasing visual similarity of the letters decreased letter naming efficiency and increased naming errors, saccades, regressions (rapid eye movements back to letters already fixated), pause times, and fixation durations; (b) children with Dyslexia_HP performed like RL controls and were less efficient, had longer articulation times, pause times, fixation durations, and made more errors and regressions than CA controls; and (c) pause time and fixation duration were the most powerful predictors of reading. We conclude that NS is related to reading via fixation durations and pause times: Longer fixation durations and pause times reflect the greater amount of time needed to acquire visual/orthographic information from stimuli and prepare the correct response.

Reading in Autistic_behavior_HP: A Literature Review.To review what the literature says about reading abilities of children on the Autism_HP spectrum (Autistic_behavior_HP, Autistic_behavior_HP) as well as to assess the results of intervention proposals. The broad Autistic_behavior_HP Diagnosis_ASDPTO used in the last decades and the resulting changes in the prevalence of these disorders have led to a relevant increase in the number of children diagnosed with Autistic_behavior_HP in the school system. The purpose of this review is to identify the different profiles of reading abilities shown by children with Autistic_behavior_HP described in the recent literature and the results of reported intervention methods.

Dyslexia_HP and Substance Use in a University Undergraduate Population.A number of Cognitive_impairment_HP are associated with Dyslexia_HP. However, only a limited amount of research has been performed exploring a putative link between Dyslexia_HP and substance use. As substance use is thought to involve a cognitive component, it is possible that the pattern of substance use would be different for dyslexic participants, when compared to nondyslexic controls. During the current study, a guiding hypothesis was that people with Dyslexia_HP would demonstrate less substance use than nondyslexic controls. Theories of memory activation, automaticity, and attentional bias in substance use suggest that cognitive components of substance use are important in the development and maintenance of continued substance use and it is thought that, at least some of these components, would be impaired in a dyslexic population.

Comorbidity of Arithmetic and Reading Disorder.The aim of the present study was to investigate the cognitive profiles of primary school children (age 82-133 months) on a battery of basic number processing and calculation tasks. The sample consisted of four groups matched for age and IQ: arithmetic disorder only (AD; n = 20), reading disorder only (RD; n = 40), a comorbid group ( n = 27), and an unimpaired control group ( n = 40). Multiple 2 (RD vs. No RD) × 2 (AD vs. No AD) factorial ANCOVAs showed that children with RD had selective impairments in counting and number transcoding efficiency. In contrast, children with AD performed poorly in most tasks, including symbolic and nonsymbolic magnitude comparisons, subitizing, number line estimation, number sets, number transcoding accuracy, and calculation. These findings provide further support that AD is characterized by multiple, Heterogeneous_HP underlying deficits. In contrast, RD is associated with specific number processing impairments only if tasks require verbal processing. Taken together, the results fully support the assumption of comorbid additivity of AD and RD.

Specific Language_impairment_HP and developmental Dyslexia_HP: What are the boundaries? Data from Greek children.This study examines the significance (between-groups comparisons) and Frequency_HP (within-group analyses) of deficits in developmental Dyslexia_HP (DD, mainly deficits in decoding and phonemic awareness), specific Language_impairment_HP (SLI, mainly deficits in listening comprehension), or both (mainly deficits in phonological short-term memory [STM]). Participants included two groups of children who had received a Diagnosis_ASDPTO of either SLI (N=15) or DD (N=15). For the between-groups comparison, the groups were matched pairwise on Absent_speech_HP IQ to 30 chronological age controls (CAC) and 30 reading level controls (RLC). For the within-group analyses, the participants were compared to 91 CACs and 63 RLCs. We developed tasks not used for the diagnoses to assess phonological skills (decoding, phonemic awareness, phonological STM) and non-phonological skills (listening and reading comprehension). SLI children scored lower than both DD children and RLCs on tasks assessing listening and reading comprehension, and lower than RLCs on phonological STM and phonemic awareness. Within-group comparisons showed that a higher proportion of SLI than DD children presented Severe_HP deficits in the same four domains. The opposite pattern was found for decoding skills (7 SLI children with a Severe_HP deficit, versus 13 in the DD group). These findings are discussed in the light of models explaining the overlap between SLI and DD. They highlight the need to assess both phonological and non-phonological skills in SLI and DD children, using both between- and within-groups designs.

Orthographic processing deficits in developmental Dyslexia_HP: Beyond the ventral visual stream.Fast effortless reading has been associated with the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA), a region in the ventral visual stream that specializes in the recognition of letter strings. Several neuroimaging studies of Dyslexia_HP revealed an underactivation of this region. However, most of these studies used reading tasks and/or were carried out on adults. Given that fluent reading is severely impaired in dyslexics, any underactivation might simply reflect a well-established reading deficit in impaired readers and could be the consequence rather than the cause of Dyslexia_HP. Here, we designed a task that does not rely on reading per se but that tapped early visual orthographic processing that forms the basis of reading. Dyslexic children aged 8-12years and age-matched controls were asked to search for letters, digits, and symbols in 5-element strings (Experiment 1). This novel task was complemented by a classic task known to activate the VWFA, namely the passive viewing of pseudowords and falsefonts (Experiment 2). We found that in addition to significant group differences in the VWFA, dyslexic children showed a significant underactivation of the middle occipital gyrus (MOG) relative to the control group. Several areas in the MOG are known for their engagement in visuospatial processing, and it has been proposed that the MOG is necessary for ordering the symbols in unfamiliar strings. Our results suggest that the VWFA deficit might be secondary to an impairment of visuospatial processing in the MOG. We argue that efficient processing in MOG in the course of reading acquisition is critical for the development of effortless fast visual word recognition in the VWFA.

Investigating the Improvement of Decoding Abilities and Working_Memory_ASDPTO in Children with Incremental or Entity Personal Conceptions of Intelligence: Two Case Reports.One of the most significant current discussions has led to the hypothesis that domain-specific training programs alone are not enough to improve reading achievement or Working_Memory_ASDPTO abilities. Incremental or Entity personal conceptions of intelligence may be assumed to be an important prognostic factor to overcome domain-specific deficits. Specifically, incremental students tend to be more oriented toward change and autonomy and are able to adopt more efficacious strategies. This study aims at examining the effect of personal conceptions of intelligence to strengthen the efficacy of a multidimensional intervention program in order to improve decoding abilities and Working_Memory_ASDPTO. Participants included two children (M age = 10 years) with developmental Dyslexia_HP and different conceptions of intelligence. The children were tested on a whole battery of reading and spelling tests commonly used in the assessment of reading disabilities in Italy. Afterwards, they were given a multimedia test to measure motivational factors such as conceptions of intelligence and achievement goals. The children took part in the T.I.R.D. Multimedia Training for the Rehabilitation of Dyslexia_HP (Rappo and Pepi, 2010) reinforced by specific units to improve verbal Working_Memory_ASDPTO for 3 months. This training consisted of specific tasks to rehabilitate both visual and phonological strategies (sound blending, word segmentation, alliteration test and rhyme test, letter recognition, digraph recognition, trigraph recognition, and word recognition as samples of visual tasks) and verbal Working_Memory_ASDPTO (rapid words and non-words recognition). Posttest evaluations showed that the child holding the incremental theory of intelligence improved more than the child holding a static representation. On the whole this study highlights the importance of treatment programs in which both specificity of deficits and motivational factors are both taken into account. There is a need to plan multifaceted intervention programs based on a transverse approach, considering both cognitive and motivational factors.

Disrupted white matter connectivity underlying developmental Dyslexia_HP: A machine learning approach.Developmental Dyslexia_HP has been hypothesized to result from multiple causes and exhibit multiple manifestations, implying a distributed multidimensional effect on human brain. The disruption of specific white-matter (WM) tracts/regions has been observed in dyslexic children. However, it remains unknown if developmental Dyslexia_HP affects the human brain WM in a multidimensional manner. Being a natural tool for evaluating this hypothesis, the multivariate machine learning approach was applied in this study to compare 28 school-aged dyslexic children with 33 age-matched controls. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging were acquired to extract five multitype WM features at a regional level: white matter volume, fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, Axial_HP diffusivity, and radial diffusivity. A linear support vector machine (LSVM) classifier achieved an accuracy of 83.61% using these MRI features to distinguish dyslexic children from controls. Notably, the most discriminative features that contributed to the classification were primarily associated with WM regions within the putative reading network/system (e.g., the superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, thalamocortical projections, and corpus callosum), the limbic system (e.g., the cingulum and fornix), and the motor system (e.g., the cerebellar peduncle, corona radiata, and corticospinal tract). These results were well replicated using a logistic regression classifier. These findings provided direct evidence supporting a multidimensional effect of developmental Dyslexia_HP on WM connectivity of human brain, and highlighted the involvement of WM tracts/regions beyond the well-recognized reading system in Dyslexia_HP. Finally, the discriminating results demonstrated a potential of WM neuroimaging features as imaging markers for identifying dyslexic individuals.

Event-related Potential Patterns Reflect Reversed Hemispheric Activity during Visual Attention Processing in Children with Dyslexia_HP: A Preliminary Study.Individuals with Dyslexia_HP experience reading difficulties, whereas their other cognitive abilities seem normal. The purpose of this study was to investigate the event-related potential (ERP) patterns of children with Dyslexia_HP during a target-detection task.

Developmental Learning_Disorders_ASDPTO: From Generic Interventions to Individualized Remediation.Developmental Learning_Disorders_ASDPTO Affect_ASDPTO many children, impairing their experience in the classroom and hindering many aspects of their life. Once a bleak sentence associated with life-long difficulties, several Learning_Disorders_ASDPTO can now be successfully alleviated, directly benefiting from promising interventions. In this review, we focus on two of the most prevalent Learning_Disorders_ASDPTO, Dyslexia_HP and attention-deficit/Hyperactivity_HP disorder (ADHD). Recent advances have refined our understanding of the specific neural networks that are altered in these disorders, yet questions remain regarding causal links between neural changes and behavioral improvements. After briefly reviewing the theoretical foundations of Dyslexia_HP and ADHD, we explore their distinct and shared characteristics, and discuss the comorbidity of the two disorders. We then examine current interventions, and consider the benefits of approaches that integrate remediation within other activities to encourage sustained motivation and improvements. Finally, we conclude with a reflection on the potential for remediation programs to be personalized by taking into account the specificities and demands of each individual. The effective remediation of Learning_Disorders_ASDPTO is critical to modern societies, especially considering the far-reaching ramifications of successful early interventions.

Vocabulary skills are well developed in university students with Dyslexia_HP: Evidence from multiple case studies.Most studies in adults with developmental Dyslexia_HP have focused on identifying the deficits responsible for their persistent reading difficulties, but little is known on how these readers manage the intensive exposure to written language required to obtain a university degree. The main objective of this study was to identify certain skills, and specifically vocabulary skills, that French university students with Dyslexia_HP have developed and that may contribute to their literacy skills. We tested 20 university students with Dyslexia_HP and 20 normal readers (matched on chronological age, gender, Absent_speech_HP IQ, and level of education) in reading, phonological, vocabulary breadth (number of known words), and vocabulary depth (accuracy and precision) tasks. In comparing vocabulary measures, we used both Rasch model and single case study methodologies. Results on reading and phonological tasks confirmed the persistence of deficits in written word recognition and phonological skills. However, using the Rasch model we found that the two groups performed at the same level in the vocabulary breadth task, whereas dyslexics systematically outperformed their chronological age controls in the vocabulary depth task. These results are supplemented by multiple case studies. The vocabulary skills of French university students with Dyslexia_HP are well developed. Possible interpretations of these results are discussed.

Applicability of dual-route reading models to Spanish.Two opposing points of view have been presented with regard to the applicability of the dual-route reading models Spanish. Some authors maintain that, given the transparency of the reading system, non-lexical reading is the strategy followed predominantly by Spanish readers and for that reason these models are not appropriate to explain Alexia_HP (acquired Dyslexia_HP) in Spanish. Other authors, consider that since several cases of phonological, surface and deep Alexia_HP have been reported, dual-route reading models are applicable to Spanish in the same way that to the irregular writing systems. In order to contrast these two points of view, an analysis of the two main factors that influence the reading is made: characteristics of the Spanish orthography and characteristics of the Spanish readers. It is conclude that, (1) Due to its transparency, non-lexical reading represents -as in other transparent orthographies-- the initial reading strategy in Spanish; (2) the "reading threshold" (i.e., time required to become literate) is lower in Spanish because there are no irregular words to learn; (3) as reading experience increases, speed increases and lexical reading becomes used more; (4) Given the characteristics of the Spanish reading system, it is understandable that Frequency_HP of deep Dyslexia_HP is so low.

Music and Dyslexia_HP: A New Musical Training Method to Improve Reading and Related Disorders.Numerous arguments in the recent neuroscientific literature support the use of musical training as a therapeutic tool among the arsenal already available to therapists and educators for treating children with Dyslexia_HP. In the present study, we tested the efficacy of a specially-designed Cognitivo-Musical Training (CMT) method based upon three principles: (1) music-language analogies: training dyslexics with music could contribute to improve brain circuits which are common to music and language processes; (2) the temporal and rhythmic features of music, which could exert a positive effect on the multiple dimensions of the "temporal deficit" characteristic of some types of Dyslexia_HP; and (3) cross-modal integration, based on converging evidence of impaired connectivity between brain regions in Dyslexia_HP and related disorders. Accordingly, we developed a series of musical exercises involving jointly and simultaneously sensory (visual, auditory, somatosensory) and motor systems, with special emphasis on rhythmic perception and production in addition to intensive training of various features of the musical auditory signal. Two separate studies were carried out, one in which dyslexic children received intensive musical exercises concentrated over 18 h during 3 consecutive days, and the other in which the 18 h of musical training were spread over 6 weeks. Both studies showed significant improvements in some untrained, linguistic and non-linguistic variables. The first one yielded significant improvement in categorical perception and auditory perception of temporal components of speech. The second study revealed additional improvements in auditory attention, phonological awareness (syllable fusion), reading abilities, and repetition of pseudo-words. Importantly, most improvements persisted after an untrained period of 6 weeks. These results provide new additional arguments for using music as part of systematic therapeutic and instructional practice for dyslexic children.

Gray Matter Features of Dyslexia_HP: A Combined Meta-Analytic and Direct Analysis Approach(1,2,3,4).Meta-analysis of voxel-based morphometry Dyslexia_HP studies and direct analysis of 293 Dyslexia_HP and control cases from six different research sites were performed to characterize defining gray matter features of Dyslexia_HP. These analyses demonstrated consistently lower gray matter volume in Left_HP posterior superior temporal sulcus/middle temporal gyrus regions and Left_HP orbitofrontal gyrus/pars orbitalis regions. Gray matter volume within both of these regions significantly predicted individual variation in reading comprehension after correcting for multiple comparisons. These regional gray matter differences were observed across published studies and in the multisite dataset after controlling for potential age and gender effects, and despite increased anatomical variance in the Dyslexia_HP group, but were not significant after controlling for total gray matter volume. Thus, the orbitofrontal and posterior superior temporal sulcus gray matter findings are relatively reliable effects that appear to be dependent on cases with low total gray matter volume. The results are considered in the context of genetics studies linking orbitofrontal and superior temporal sulcus regions to alleles that confer risk for Dyslexia_HP.
Gray Matter Features of Reading Disability: A Combined Meta-Analytic and Direct Analysis Approach(1,2,3,4).Meta-analysis of voxel-based morphometry dyslexia studies and direct analysis of 293 reading disability and control cases from six different research sites were performed to characterize defining gray matter features of reading disability. These analyses demonstrated consistently lower gray matter volume in left posterior superior temporal sulcus/middle temporal gyrus regions and left orbitofrontal gyrus/pars orbitalis regions. Gray matter volume within both of these regions significantly predicted individual variation in reading comprehension after correcting for multiple comparisons. These regional gray matter differences were observed across published studies and in the multisite dataset after controlling for potential age and gender effects, and despite increased anatomical variance in the reading disability group, but were not significant after controlling for total gray matter volume.

Tackling the 'Dyslexia_HP paradox': reading brain and behavior for early markers of developmental Dyslexia_HP.Developmental Dyslexia_HP is an unexplained inability to acquire accurate or fluent reading that affects approximately 5-17% of children. Dyslexia_HP is associated with structural and functional alterations in various brain regions that support reading. Neuroimaging studies in infants and pre-reading children suggest that these alterations predate reading instruction and reading failure, supporting the hypothesis that variant function in Dyslexia_HP susceptibility genes lead to atypical neural migration and/or axonal growth during early, most likely in utero, brain development. Yet, Dyslexia_HP is typically not diagnosed until a child has failed to learn to read as expected (usually in second grade or later). There is emerging evidence that neuroimaging measures, when combined with key behavioral measures, can enhance the accuracy of identification of Dyslexia_HP risk in pre-reading children but its sensitivity, specificity, and cost-efficiency is still unclear. Early identification of Dyslexia_HP risk carries important implications for Dyslexia_HP remediation and the amelioration of the psychosocial consequences commonly associated with reading failure.

Reading changes in children and adolescents with Dyslexia_HP after transcranial direct current stimulation.Noninvasive brain stimulation offers the possibility to induce changes in cortical excitability and it is an interesting option as a remediation tool for the treatment of developmental disorders. This study aimed to investigate the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on reading and reading-related skills of children and adolescents with Dyslexia_HP. Nineteen children and adolescents with Dyslexia_HP performed different reading and reading-related tasks (word, nonword, and text reading; lexical decision; phonemic blending; verbal Working_Memory_ASDPTO; rapid automatized naming) in a baseline condition without tDCS and after 20 min of exposure to three different tDCS conditions: Left_HP anodal/Right_HP cathodal tDCS to enhance Left_HP lateralization of the parietotemporal region, Right_HP anodal/Left_HP cathodal tDCS to enhance Right_HP lateralization of the parietotemporal region, and sham tDCS. In text reading, results showed a significant reduction in errors after Left_HP anodal/Right_HP cathodal tDCS and an increase in errors after Left_HP cathodal/Right_HP anodal tDCS. No effect was found in the other reading and reading-related tasks. Our findings indicate for the first time that one session of tDCS modulates some aspects of reading performance of children and adolescents with Dyslexia_HP and that the effect is polarity dependent. These single-session results support a potential role of tDCS for developing treatment protocols and suggest possible parameters for tDCS treatment customization in children and adolescents with Dyslexia_HP.

Computerized Writing and Reading Instruction for Students in Grades 4 to 9 With Specific Learning Disabilities Affecting Written Language.Computer scientists and educational researchers evaluated effectiveness of computerized instruction tailored to evidence-based impairments in specific learning disabilities (SLDs) in students in grades 4 to 9 with persisting SLDs despite prior extra help. Following comprehensive, evidence-based differential Diagnosis_ASDPTO for Dysgraphia_HP (impaired handwriting), Dyslexia_HP (impaired word reading and spelling), and oral and written language learning disability (OWL LD), students completed 18 sessions of computerized instruction over about 3 months. The 11 students taught letter formation with sequential, numbered, colored arrow cues with full contours who wrote letters on lines added to iPAD screen showed more and stronger treatment effects than the 21 students taught using only visual motion cues for letter formation who wrote on an unlined computer monitor. Teaching to all levels of language in multiple functional language systems (by ear, eye, mouth, and hand) close in time resulted in significant gains in Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO skills for the group and in diagnosed SLD hallmark impairments for individuals; also, performance on computerized learning activities correlated with treatment gains. Results are discussed in reference to need for both accommodations and explicit instruction for persisting SLDs and the potential for computers to teach handwriting, morphophonemic orthographies, comprehension, and composition.

Rapid Naming in Brazilian Students with Dyslexia_HP and Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_HP.The effective development of Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO skills requires the concerted action of several abilities, one of which is phonological processing. One of the main components of phonological processing is rapid automatized naming (RAN)-the ability to identify and recognize a given item by the activation and concomitant articulation of its name.

Altered hemispheric lateralization of white matter pathways in developmental Dyslexia_HP: Evidence from spherical deconvolution tractography.This study examines the structural integrity and the hemispheric lateralization patterns of four major association fiber pathways in a group of French dyslexic children and age-matched controls (from 9 to 14 years), using high angular diffusion imaging combined with spherical deconvolution tractography. Compared with age-matched controls, dyslexic children show increased hindrance-modulated oriented anisotropy (HMOA) in the Right_HP superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). They also show a reduced leftward asymmetry of the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) and an increased Right_HPward asymmetry of the second branch of the SLF (SLF II). The lateralization pattern of IFOF and SLF II also accounts for individual differences in dyslexic children's reading abilities. These data provide evidence for an abnormal lateralization of occipito-frontal and parieto-frontal pathways in developmental Dyslexia_HP.

Implicit learning deficits among adults with developmental Dyslexia_HP.The aim of the present study was to investigate implicit learning processes among adults with developmental Dyslexia_HP (DD) using a visual linguistic artificial grammar learning (AGL) task. Specifically, it was designed to explore whether the intact learning reported in previous studies would also occur under conditions including minimal training and instructions that do not reveal the grammatical nature of the strings. Twenty-nine (14 DD and 15 typical development (TD)) adults were presented with letter sequences in the training phase and were asked to classify the test strings for their grammaticality. The results of the d' measures in the implicit task indicated that learning had occurred for both groups, as the proportion of hits exceeded the proportion of false alarms. However, a significant difference was found between the groups in their learning measures, as TD readers performed significantly better than individuals with DD, supporting the assumption of a deficit in implicit sequential learning processes among individuals with DD. In order to examine whether the deficit found in the first experiment was indeed due to a deficit in implicit processes, a second experiment was designed in which explicit instructions were given during an AGL task. Results of the explicit task strengthen the assumption that the deficit is indeed specific to implicit sequential processes, as no difference between the groups was found when participants were aware of the existence of the grammar underlying the strings. Theoretical and clinical implications are discussed.

The Role of Trait Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP and Preoccupation With Reading Disabilities of Children and Their Mothers in Predicting Children's Reading Comprehension.This study investigated the relationship between reading comprehension (RC), trait Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP, and preoccupation with Dyslexia_HP (RD) in 88 school children in Grades 3 through 5 and in their mothers. Children's trait Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP had a significant direct negative relationship with RC and also mediated the association between preoccupation with RD and RC. Mothers' preoccupation with their children's RDs had a direct negative association with their children's RC. This association was also mediated through children's trait Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP. No association was found between mothers' trait Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP and children's RC. In a final model, RC was explained significantly by children's word reading fluency and trait Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP as well as by their mothers' preoccupation with their children's RDs. This study extends our understanding of multicomponential models of RC by shedding light on the significant role played by Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP- and preoccupation-related factors involving both children with RDs and their mothers.

Genomic sequencing of a Dyslexia_HP susceptibility haplotype encompassing ROBO1.The DYX5 locus for developmental Dyslexia_HP was mapped to chromosome 3 by linkage study of a large Finnish family, and later, roundabout guidance receptor 1 (ROBO1) was implicated as a candidate gene at DYX5 with suppressed expression from the segregating rare haplotype. A functional magnetoencephalographic study of several family members revealed abnormal auditory processing of interaural interaction, supporting a defect in midline crossing of auditory pathways. In the current study, we have characterized genetic variation in the broad ROBO1 gene region in the DYX5-linked family, aiming to identify variants that would increase our understanding of the altered expression of ROBO1.

Evidence for reading improvement following tDCS treatment in children and adolescents with Dyslexia_HP.There is evidence that non-invasive brain stimulation transitorily modulates reading by facilitating the neural pathways underactive in individuals with Dyslexia_HP. The study aimed at investigating whether multiple sessions of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) would enhance reading abilities of children and adolescents with Dyslexia_HP and whether the effect is long-lasting.

L2 Spelling Errors in Italian Children with Dyslexia_HP.The present study aimed to investigate L2 spelling skills in Italian children by administering an English word dictation task to 13 children with Dyslexia_HP (CD), 13 control children (comparable in age, gender, schooling and IQ) and a group of 10 children with an English learning difficulty, but no L1 learning disorder. Patterns of difficulties were examined for accuracy and type of errors, in spelling dictated short and long words (i.e. disyllables and three syllables). Notably, CD were poor in spelling English words. Furthermore, their errors were mainly related with phonological representation of words, as they made more 'phonologically' implausible errors than controls. In addition, CD errors were more Frequent_HP for short than long words. Conversely, the three groups did not differ in the number of plausible ('non-phonological') errors, that is, words that were incorrectly written, but whose reading could correspond to the dictated word via either Italian or English rules. Error analysis also showed syllable Position_HP differences in the spelling patterns of CD, children with and English learning difficulty and control children.

Child and environmental risk factors predicting readiness for learning in children at high risk of Dyslexia_HP.We investigate the role of Distal_HP, Proximal_HP, and child risk factors as predictors of reading readiness and attention and behavior in children at risk of Dyslexia_HP. The parents of a longitudinal sample of 251 preschool children, including children at family risk of Dyslexia_HP and children with preschool language difficulties, provided measures of socioeconomic status, home literacy environment, family stresses, and child health via interviews and questionnaires. Assessments of children's reading-related skills, behavior, and attention were used to define their readiness for learning at school entry. Children at family risk of Dyslexia_HP and children with preschool language difficulties experienced more environmental adversities and health risks than controls. The risks associated with family risk of Dyslexia_HP and with language status were additive. Both home literacy environment and child health predicted reading readiness while home literacy environment and family stresses predicted attention and behavior. Family risk of Dyslexia_HP did not predict readiness to learn once other risks were controlled and so seems likely to be best conceptualized as representing gene-environment correlations. Pooling across risks defined a cumulative risk index, which was a significant predictor of reading readiness and, together with Absent_speech_HP ability, accounted for 31% of the variance between children.

Deterioration of Dyslexia_HP after non-dominant temporal lobectomy for drug-resistant Epilepsy_ASDPTO.We present a patient with drug-resistant Right_HP temporal lobe Epilepsy_ASDPTO, caused by a ganglioglioma of the parahippocampal gyrus. Preoperatively, the patient was also known to have Dyslexia_HP. A Right_HP anterior temporal lobectomy, including complete lesionectomy, was performed. Several months after the otherwise uncomplicated procedure, the patient complained about visual memory disturbances, accompanied by increased reading and spelling problems. Postoperative neuropsychological examination revealed deterioration of the visual memory functions, compared to the preoperative assessment, and consequently provided a possible explanation for worsening of the pre-existing Dyslexia_HP. In this case report, we hypothesize on the cause of this unusual deterioration and present recommendations to be included in the preoperative Epilepsy_ASDPTO surgery evaluation for patients with verbal or reading disorders such as Dyslexia_HP.

A new familial case of microdeletion syndrome 10p15.3.In 2012 a small terminal deletion in the short arm of chromosome 10 in the region 10p15.3 was reported as a novel microdeletion syndrome. By now 21 patients, including a single familial case, have been reported. Characteristic findings comprise variable Cognitive_impairment_HP or Global_developmental_delay_HP, disorder of speech development, as well as various dysmorphic signs. We here report on a new patient, an eight year old girl, with a microdeletion syndrome 10p15.3. She is a foster child showing intellectual deficits, disorder of speech development, Behavioral_abnormality_HP, Abnormal_heart_morphology_HP, and several dysmorphic signs. The same microdeletion was subsequently found in the six year old maternal half-sister, showing very similar developmental and cognitive issues, including major Neurological_speech_impairment_HP. The mother has not obtained a school degree. She was described as being a dissocial person with Severe_HP alcohol abuse and showing minor cognitive disability. Thus Mode_of_inheritance_HP of the microdeletion from a probably symptomatic mother can be assumed. The patients presented here add up to the as yet small number of reported cases of microdeletion 10p15.3 and thereby might help to establish a more comprehensive clinical spectrum of this rather newly discovered syndrome.

Cognitive and familial risk evidence converged: A data-driven identification of distinct and homogeneous subtypes within the Heterogeneous_HP sample of reading disabled children.The evident degree of Heterogeneous_HP observed in reading disabled children has puzzled reading researchers for decades. Recent advances in the genetic underpinnings of Dyslexia_HP have indicated that the heritable, familial risk for Dyslexia_HP is a major risk factor. The present data-driven, classification attempt aims to revisit the possibility of identifying distinct cognitive deficit profiles in a large sample of second to fourth grade reading disabled children. In this sample, we investigated whether genetic and environmental risk factors are able to distinguish between poor reader subtypes. In this profile, we included reading-related measures of phonemic awareness, letter-speech sound processing and rapid naming, known as candidate vulnerability markers associated with Dyslexia_HP and familial risk for Dyslexia_HP, as well as general cognitive abilities (non-verbal IQ and vocabulary). Clustering was based on a 200 multi-start K-means approach. Results revealed four emerging subtypes of which the first subtype showed no Cognitive_impairment_HP underlying their poor reading skills (Reading-only impaired poor readers). The other three subtypes shared a core phonological deficit (PA) with a variable and discriminative expression across the other underlying vulnerability markers. More specific, type 2 showed low to poor performance across all reading-related and general cognitive abilities (general poor readers), type 3 showed a specific letter-speech sound mapping deficit next to a PA deficit (PA-LS specific poor readers) and type 4 showed a specific rapid naming deficit complementing their phonological weakness (PA-RAN specific poor readers). The first three poor reader profiles were more characterized by variable environmental risk factor, while the fourth, PA-RAN poor reader subtype showed a significantly strong familial risk for Dyslexia_HP. Overall, when we zoom in on the Heterogeneous_HP phenomenon of Dyslexia_HP, unique and distinct cognitive subtypes can be identified, distinguishing between those poor readers more influences by the role of genes and those more influenced by environmental risk factors. Taking into account this diversity of distinct cognitive subtypes, instead of looking at the reading disabled sample as a whole, will help tailor future diagnostic and intervention efforts more specifically to the needs of children with such a specific deficit and risk pattern, as well as providing a more promising way forward for genetic studies of Dyslexia_HP.

In this profile, we included reading-related measures of phonemic awareness, letter-speech sound processing and rapid naming, known as candidate vulnerability markers associated with dyslexia and familial risk for dyslexia, as well as general cognitive abilities (non-verbal IQ and vocabulary). Clustering was based on a 200 multi-start K-means approach. Results revealed four emerging subtypes of which the first subtype showed no cognitive deficits underlying their poor reading skills (Reading-only impaired poor readers). The other three subtypes shared a core phonological deficit (PA) with a variable and discriminative expression across the other underlying vulnerability markers. More specific, type 2 showed low to poor performance across all reading-related and general cognitive abilities (general poor readers), type 3 showed a specific letter-speech sound mapping deficit next to a PA deficit (PA-LS specific poor readers) and type 4 showed a specific rapid naming deficit complementing their phonological weakness (PA-RAN specific poor readers). The first three poor reader profiles were more characterized by variable environmental risk factor, while the fourth, PA-RAN poor reader subtype showed a significantly strong familial risk for dyslexia. Overall, when we zoom in on the heterogeneous phenomenon of reading disability, unique and distinct cognitive subtypes can be identified, distinguishing between those poor readers more influences by the role of genes and those more influenced by environmental risk factors. Taking into account this diversity of distinct cognitive subtypes, instead of looking at the reading disabled sample as a whole, will help tailor future diagnostic and intervention efforts more specifically to the needs of children with such a specific deficit and risk pattern, as well as providing a more promising way forward for genetic studies of dyslexia.
A longitudinal investigation of the relationship between crowding and reading: A neurodegenerative approach.We have previously documented two patients (FOL and CLA) with posterior Cerebral_cortical_atrophy_HP who achieved accurate and rapid reading despite deficits in ten measures of visual processing, with two notable exceptions: (1) a measure of visual acuity, (2) a measure of visual crowding. Subsequent longitudinal investigation of these patients was carried out, involving annual tests of early visual, visuoperceptual and visuospatial processing and assessment of reading ability. Follow-up assessments identified the evolution of a particular early visual processing deficit, excessive visual crowding; this deficit has been previously implicated in forms of Dyslexia_HP. Consistent with the link between crowding and reading dysfunction, follow-up assessments also revealed deterioration in both patients' reading ability. The current findings demonstrate a neurodegenerative approach towards understanding the relationship between visual crowding and the reading system, and suggest possible mechanisms for how excessive crowding may disrupt word recognition.

Neural basis of phonological awareness in beginning readers with familial risk of Dyslexia_HP-Results from shallow orthography.Phonological processing ability is a key factor in reading acquisition, predicting its later success or causing reading problems when it is weakened. Our aim here was to establish the neural correlates of auditory word rhyming (a standard phonological measure) in 102 young children with (FHD+) and without familial history of Dyslexia_HP (FHD-) in a shallow orthography (i.e. Polish). Secondly, in order to gain a deeper understanding on how schooling shapes brain activity to phonological awareness, a comparison was made of children who had had formal literacy instruction for several months (in first grade) and those who had not yet had any formal instruction in literacy (in kindergarten). FHD+ children compared to FHD- children in the first grade scored lower in an early print task and showed longer reaction times in the in-scanner rhyme task. No behavioral differences between FHD+ and FHD- were found in the kindergarten group. On the neuronal level, overall familial risk was associated with reduced activation in the Bilateral_HP temporal, tempo-parietal and inferior temporal-occipital regions, as well as the Bilateral_HP inferior and middle frontal gyri. Subcortically, hypoactivation was found in the Bilateral_HP thalami, caudate, and Right_HP putamen in FHD+. A main effect of the children's grade was present only in the Left_HP inferior frontal gyrus, where reduced activation for rhyming was shown in first-graders. Several regions in the ventral occipital cortex, including the fusiform gyrus, and in the Right_HP middle frontal and postcentral gyri, displayed an interaction between familial risk and grade. The present results show strong influence of familial risk that may actually increase with formal literacy instruction.

Reading Achievement in Boys With Non-Syndromic Cleft_palate_HP Only: Relationship to Neuropsychological Skill and Neurocircuitry.Reading achievement and neural activation during a reading task were evaluated among boys with isolated Cleft_palate_HP only (iCP) in comparison to Unaffected_HP controls. Ten boys with iCP and 10 Unaffected_HP boys between the ages of 8 and 16 years old were assessed. Standardized assessments of intelligence and reading achievement were administered and participants underwent a block-design functional magnetic resonance imaging protocol using non-word rhyming and judgment of line tasks. Among the 10 boys with iCP, reading fluency correlated with phonological awareness and visual memory. Neural activation was increased in regions of the brain associated with a non-fluent/dyslexic reading pattern.

Reading Prosody_ASDPTO in Spanish dyslexics.Reading becomes expressive when word and text reading are quick, accurate and automatic. Recent studies have reported that skilled readers use greater pitch changes and fewer irrelevant pauses than poor readers. Given that developmental dyslexics have difficulty acquiring and automating the alphabetic code and developing orthographic representations of words, it is possible that their use of Prosody_ASDPTO when reading differs from that of typical readers. The goal of this study was to investigate whether the reading Prosody_ASDPTO of Spanish-speaking dyslexics differs from that of typical Spanish readers. Two experiments were performed. The first experiment involved 36 children (18 with Dyslexia_HP), and the second involved 46 adults (23 with Dyslexia_HP). Participants were asked to read aloud a text which included declarative, exclamatory and interrogative sentences. Data on pausing and reading rate (number of pauses, duration of pauses and utterances), pitch changes, Severity_HP changes and syllable lengthening were extracted from the recordings. We found that dyslexic people read more slowly than typical readers and they also made more inappropriate and longer pauses, even as adults with considerable reading experience. We also observed that dyslexics differed from skilled readers in their use of some prosodic features, particularly pitch changes at the end of sentences. This is probably because they have trouble anticipating some structural features of prose, such as sentence ends.

Developmental Dysgraphia_HP as a Reading System and Transfer Problem: A Case Study.This is a case study of an adolescent who had largely overcome his early difficulty in learning to read, but continued to have Severe_HP problems with spelling. He had no visual Memory_impairment_HP, and his letter-sound knowledge and phonemic awareness were at adult levels. Testing revealed that his difficulties in both reading and spelling only manifested when processing unfamiliar words. He was slow and inaccurate when reading non-words, despite a sublexical system dominated by the use of grapheme-phoneme units. It is suggested that limitations in the processing of the reading system were responsible for the lack of an extensive set of induced Position_HP-sensitive sublexical representations (ISRs) that are contextually dependent. This would have serious consequences for transfer to spelling.

Using a Process Dissociation Approach to Assess Verbal Short-Term Memory for Item and Order Information in a Sample of Individuals with a Self-Reported Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Dyslexia_HP.Previous studies have examined whether difficulties in short-term memory for verbal information, that might be associated with Dyslexia_HP, are driven by problems in retaining either information about to-be-remembered items or the order in which these items were presented. However, such studies have not used process-pure measures of short-term memory for item or order information. In this work we adapt a process dissociation procedure to properly distinguish the contributions of item and order processes to verbal short-term memory in a group of 28 adults with a self-reported Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Dyslexia_HP and a comparison sample of 29 adults without a Dyslexia_HP Diagnosis_ASDPTO. In contrast to previous work that has suggested that individuals with Dyslexia_HP experience item deficits resulting from inefficient phonological representation and language-independent order memory deficits, the results showed no evidence of specific problems in short-term retention of either item or order information among the individuals with a self-reported Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Dyslexia_HP, despite this group showing expected difficulties on separate measures of word and non-word reading. However, there was some suggestive evidence of a link between order memory for verbal material and individual differences in non-word reading, consistent with other claims for a role of order memory in phonologically mediated reading. The data from the current study therefore provide empirical evidence to question the extent to which item and order short-term memory are necessarily impaired in Dyslexia_HP.

Resting State EEG Hemispheric Power Asymmetry in Children with Dyslexia_HP.Dyslexia_HP is a neurodevelopmental disorder estimated to Affect_ASDPTO between 4 and 7% of the population. It is often referred to as a learning disability and is characterized by deficits in the linguistic system. To better understand the neural underpinnings of Dyslexia_HP, we examined the electroencephalography (EEG) power spectra between pre-adolescents with Dyslexia_HP and neurotypical control children during eyes closed state. We reported the differences in spontaneous oscillatory activity of each major EEG band (delta, theta, alpha, and beta) adopting a global as well as in a region-by-region and hemispheric approach to elucidate whether there are changes in asymmetry in children with Dyslexia_HP compared to controls. We also examined the relationship between EEG power spectra and clinical variables. The findings of our study confirm the presence of an atypical linguistic network, evident in children with Dyslexia_HP. This abnormal network hallmarked by a dominance of theta activity suggests that these abnormalities are present prior to these children learning to read, thus implicating delayed maturation and abnormal hypoarousal mechanisms.

Oral morphosyntactic competence as a predictor of reading comprehension in children with specific Language_impairment_HP.Children with a Diagnosis_ASDPTO of specific Language_impairment_HP (SLI) present impaired oral comprehension. According to the simple view of reading, general amodal linguistic capacity accounts for both oral and reading comprehension. Considering this, we should expect SLI children to display a reading comprehension deficit. However, previous research regarding the association between reading disorders and SLI has yielded inconsistent results.

Education Influences Creativity in Dyslexic and Non-Dyslexic Children and Teenagers.Are dyslexic children and teenagers more creative than non-dyslexic children and teenagers? Whether creativity is higher in Dyslexia_HP, and whether this could be related to neurological development specific to the dyslexic disorder, or to compensatory strategies acquired later in life, remains unclear. Here, we suggest an additional role of differential educational approaches taken in each school that could either enhance or suppress an already higher baseline creativity of dyslexic children and teenagers.

Relationships between Categorical Perception of Phonemes, Phoneme Awareness, and Visual Attention Span in Developmental Dyslexia_HP.We tested the hypothesis that the categorical perception deficit of speech sounds in developmental Dyslexia_HP is related to phoneme awareness skills, whereas a visual attention (VA) span deficit constitutes an independent deficit. Phoneme awareness tasks, VA span tasks and categorical perception tasks of phoneme identification and discrimination using a d/t voicing continuum were administered to 63 dyslexic children and 63 control children matched on chronological age. Results showed significant differences in categorical perception between the dyslexic and control children. Significant correlations were found between categorical perception skills, phoneme awareness and reading. Although VA span correlated with reading, no significant correlations were found between either categorical perception or phoneme awareness and VA span. Mediation analyses performed on the whole dyslexic sample suggested that the effect of categorical perception on reading might be mediated by phoneme awareness. This relationship was independent of the participants' VA span abilities. Two groups of dyslexic children with a single phoneme awareness or a single VA span deficit were then identified. The phonologically impaired group showed lower categorical perception skills than the control group but categorical perception was similar in the VA span impaired dyslexic and control children. The overall findings suggest that the link between categorical perception, phoneme awareness and reading is independent from VA span skills. These findings provide new insights on the Heterogeneous_HP of developmental Dyslexia_HP. They suggest that phonological processes and VA span independently Affect_ASDPTO reading acquisition.

Surface errors without semantic impairment in acquired Dyslexia_HP: a voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping study.Patients with surface Dyslexia_HP have disproportionate difficulty pronouncing irregularly spelled words (e.g. pint), suggesting impaired use of lexical-semantic information to mediate phonological retrieval. Patients with this deficit also make characteristic 'regularization' errors, in which an irregularly spelled word is mispronounced by incorrect application of regular spelling-sound correspondences (e.g. reading plaid as 'played'), indicating over-reliance on sublexical grapheme-phoneme correspondences. We examined the neuroanatomical correlates of this specific error type in 45 patients with Left_HP hemisphere Chronic_HP Stroke_HP. Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping showed a strong positive relationship between the rate of regularization errors and damage to the posterior half of the Left_HP middle temporal gyrus. Semantic deficits on tests of single-word comprehension were generally Mild_HP, and these deficits were not correlated with the rate of regularization errors. Furthermore, the deep occipital-temporal white matter locus associated with these Mild_HP semantic deficits was distinct from the lesion site associated with regularization errors. Thus, in contrast to patients with surface Dyslexia_HP and semantic impairment from anterior temporal lobe degeneration, surface errors in our patients were not related to a semantic deficit. We propose that these patients have an inability to link intact semantic representations with phonological representations. The data provide novel evidence for a post-semantic mechanism mediating the production of surface errors, and suggest that the posterior middle temporal gyrus may compute an intermediate representation linking semantics with phonology.

Teacher candidates' mastery of phoneme-grapheme correspondence: massed versus distributed practice in teacher education.Matching phonemes (speech sounds) to graphemes (letters and letter combinations) is an important aspect of decoding (translating print to speech) and encoding (translating speech to print). Yet, many teacher candidates do not receive explicit training in phoneme-grapheme correspondence. Difficulty with accurate phoneme production and/or lack of understanding of sound-symbol correspondence can make it challenging for teachers to (a) identify student errors on common assessments and (b) serve as a model for students when teaching beginning reading or providing remedial reading instruction. For students with Dyslexia_HP, lack of teacher proficiency in this area is particularly problematic. This study examined differences between two learning conditions (massed and distributed practice) on teacher candidates' development of phoneme-grapheme correspondence knowledge and skills. An experimental, pretest-posttest-delayed test design was employed with teacher candidates (n = 52) to compare a massed practice condition (one, 60-min session) to a distributed practice condition (four, 15-min sessions distributed over 4 weeks) for learning phonemes associated with letters and letter combinations. Participants in the distributed practice condition significantly outperformed participants in the massed practice condition on their ability to correctly produce phonemes associated with different letters and letter combinations. Implications for teacher preparation are discussed.

Risk-taking propensity and sensitivity to punishment in adolescents with Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_HP and Hyperactivity_HP disorder symptoms and/or Dyslexia_HP.Many studies reported that adolescents with ADHD/RD more frequently engage in risk-taking behaviors. Very few have examined their Risk_taking_HP patterns and the impact of their comorbidity. The present study compared the risk-taking propensity, sensitivity to punishment and delinquency outcome in Chinese adolescents with ADHD symptoms (AS) and/or RD using a simulated risk task, the Balloon Analogous Risk Task (BART). Adolescents with AS (n=37), RD (n=35), AS+RD (n=35), and control (n=36) were recruited from local secondary schools. Results showed that adolescents with ADHD, despite their great risk-taking propensity, were sensitive to immediate punishment whereas adolescents with RD were found to display normal risk-taking propensity, yet showed a tendency of being less sensitive to punishment. The comorbidity ADHD+RD group had the highest delinquency score, and exhibited greatest Risk_taking_HP and least sensitivity to punishment, which provided further support that comorbid condition might have stronger impact on Risk_taking_HP or even delinquency than the pure groups. The present findings provides a useful picture of the Risk_taking_HP pattern associated with different groups, allowing for effective matching for future prevention and intervention program.

Executive functions in adults with developmental Dyslexia_HP.Executive functioning (EF) deficits are well recognized in developmental Dyslexia_HP, yet the majority of studies have concerned children rather than adults, ignored the subjective experience of the individual with Dyslexia_HP (with regard to their own EFs), and have not followed current theoretical perspectives on EFs.

ERPs Reveal the Time-Course of Aberrant Visual-Phonological Binding in Developmental Dyslexia_HP.New evidence is accumulating for a deficit in binding visual-orthographic information with the corresponding phonological code in developmental Dyslexia_HP. Here, we identify the mechanisms underpinning this deficit using event-related brain potentials (ERPs) in dyslexic and control adult readers performing a letter-matching task. In each trial, a printed letter was presented synchronously with an auditory letter name. Incongruent (mismatched), Frequent_HP trials were interleaved with congruent (matched) inFrequent_HP target pairs, which participants were asked to report by pressing a button. In critical trials, incongruent letter pairs were mismatched but confusable in terms of their visual or phonological features. Typical readers showed early detection of deviant trials, indicated by larger modulation in the range of the phonological mismatch negativity (PMN) compared with standard trials. This was followed by stronger modulation of the P3b wave for visually confusable deviants and an increased lateralized readiness potential (LRP) for phonological deviants, compared with standards. In contrast, dyslexic readers showed reduced sensitivity to deviancy in the PMN range. Responses to deviants in the P3b range indicated normal letter recognition processes, but the LRP calculation revealed a specific impairment for visual-orthographic information during response selection in Dyslexia_HP. In a follow-up experiment using an analogous non-lexical task in the same participants, we found no reading-group differences, indicating a degree of specificity to over-learnt visual-phonological binding. Our findings indicate early insensitivity to visual-phonological binding in developmental Dyslexia_HP, coupled with difficulty selecting the correct orthographic code.

[Visual training in children].The visual system has a pivotal role in most human activities. Many health disorders and psychomotor deficits involve the visual system at some level. From this some therapists infer a causal relation and apply a variety of visual therapies and trainings to cure a variety of deficits. The most prominent example is Dyslexia_HP, a disorder not caused by a defect in the primary visual system. Worldwide various non-evidence based therapies are used to treat Dyslexia_HP. The great number of exercises and visual trainings is contrasted by scientific evidence, which shows that exercises are useful in only few and selected disorders. The human visual system seems to be optimized such that no improvement can be achieved with training.

Altered neural circuits accompany lower performance during narrative comprehension in children with reading difficulties: an fMRI study.Narrative comprehension is a linguistic ability that is foundational for future reading ability. The aim of the current study was to examine the neural circuitry of children with reading difficulties (RD) compared to typical readers during a narrative-comprehension task. We hypothesized that due to deficient Executive_Function_ASDPTOs, which support narrative comprehension abilities, children with RD would display altered activation and functional connectivity, as well as lower performance on a narrative-comprehension task. Children with RD and typical readers were scanned during a narrative-comprehension task and administered reading behavioral tests. Children with RD scored significantly lower on the narrative-comprehension task than did typical readers. Composite activation maps showed more diffused activation during narrative comprehension in the RD group. Maps comparing the two reading groups showed more activation in the frontal lobes (regions responsible for Executive_Function_ASDPTOs), and functional connectivity showed higher global efficiency in children with RD than in typical readers. Global efficiency was negatively correlated with phonological awareness and reading and Executive_Function_ASDPTO scores in the entire study group. Children with RD may suffer from narrative-comprehension difficulties due to diffused activation of language areas, as was observed during a narrative-comprehension task. Greater effort in this task may be reflected by the engagement of brain regions related to Executive_Function_ASDPTOs and higher functional connectivity or attributed to difficulties in phonological processing and reading and Executive_Function_ASDPTOs. Therefore, the accommodation given to children with RD of reading aloud may need to be revised due to the observed difficulty in this domain.

Phonological processing in children with specific Language_impairment_HP with and without reading difficulties.Specific Language_impairment_HP (SLI) is Heterogeneous_HP and identifying subgroups within it may help explain the aetiology of the condition. Phonological processing abilities distinguish between children with SLI who do and do not have reading decoding impairments (RDIs).

The effect of a specialized Dyslexia_HP font, OpenDyslexic, on reading rate and accuracy.A single-subject alternating treatment design was used to investigate the extent to which a specialized Dyslexia_HP font, OpenDyslexic, impacted reading rate or accuracy compared to two commonly used fonts when used with elementary students identified as having Dyslexia_HP. OpenDyslexic was compared to Arial and Times New Roman in three reading tasks: (a) letter naming, (b) word reading, and (c) nonsense word reading. Data were analyzed through visual analysis and improvement rate difference, a nonparametric measure of nonoverlap for comparing treatments. Results from this alternating treatment experiment show no improvement in reading rate or accuracy for individual students with Dyslexia_HP, as well as the group as a whole. While some students commented that the font was "new" or "different", none of the participants reported preferring to read material presented in that font. These results indicate there may be no benefit for translating print materials to this font.

Translating Dyslexia_HP across species.Direct relationships between induced mutation in the DCDC2 candidate Dyslexia_HP susceptibility gene in mice and changes in behavioral measures of visual spatial learning have been reported. We were interested in determining whether performance on a visual-spatial learning and memory task could be translated across species (study 1) and whether children with reading impairment showed a similar impairment to animal models of the disorder (study 2). Study 1 included 37 participants who completed six trials of four different virtual Hebb-Williams maze configurations. A 2 × 4 × 6 mixed factorial repeated measures ANOVA indicated consistency in performance between humans and mice on these tasks, enabling us to translate across species. Study 2 included a total of 91 participants (age range = 8-13 years). Eighteen participants were identified with reading disorder by performance on the Woodcock-Johnson III Tests of Achievement. Participants completed six trials of five separate virtual Hebb-Williams maze configurations. A 2 × 5 × 6 mixed factorial ANCOVA (gender as covariate) indicated that individuals with reading impairment demonstrated impaired visuo-spatial performance on this task. Overall, results from this study suggest that we are able to translate behavioral deficits observed in genetic animal models of Dyslexia_HP to humans with reading impairment. Future studies will utilize the virtual environment to further explore the underlying basis for this impairment.

Neural processing of amplitude and formant rise time in Dyslexia_HP.This study aimed to investigate how children with Dyslexia_HP weight amplitude rise time (ART) and formant rise time (FRT) cues in phonetic discrimination. Passive mismatch responses (MMR) were recorded for a/ba/-/wa/contrast in a multiple deviant odd-ball paradigm to identify the neural response to cue weighting in 17 children with Dyslexia_HP and 17 age-matched control children. The deviant stimuli had either partial or full ART or FRT cues. The results showed that ART did not generate an MMR in either group, whereas both partial and full FRT cues generated MMR in control children while only full FRT cues generated MMR in children with Dyslexia_HP. These findings suggest that children, both controls and those with Dyslexia_HP, discriminate speech based on FRT cues and not ART cues. However, control children have greater sensitivity to FRT cues in speech compared to children with Dyslexia_HP.

Predicting Growth in Word Level Reading Skills in Children With Developmental Dyslexia_HP Using an Object Rhyming Functional Neuroimaging Task.An object rhyming task that does not require text reading and is suitable for younger children was used to predict gains in word level reading skills following an intensive 2-year reading intervention for children with developmental Dyslexia_HP. The task evoked activation in Bilateral_HP inferior frontal regions. Growth in untimed pseudoword reading was associated with increased pre-intervention activation of the Left_HP inferior frontal gyrus, and growth in timed word reading was associated with pre-intervention activation of the Left_HP and Right_HP inferior frontal gyri. These analyses help identify pre-intervention factors that facilitate reading skill improvements in children with developmental Dyslexia_HP.

Psychosocial co-morbidities in adolescents and adults with histories of communication disorders.Few studies have considered the long-term psychosocial outcomes of individuals with histories of early childhood speech sound disorders (SSD). Research on long-term psychosocial outcomes of individuals with Language_impairment_HP (LI) have frequently failed to consider the effects of co-morbid SSD. The purpose of this study was to compare individuals with histories of SSD-only versus SSD with LI on these outcomes and to examine the contributions of other comorbid conditions including reading disorders (RD) and Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_HP (ADHD).

Functional Alterations in Order Short-Term Memory Networks in Adults With Dyslexia_HP.Dyslexia_HP is characterized not only by reading impairment but also by short-term memory (STM) deficits, and this particularly for the retention of serial order information. Here, we explored the functional neural correlates associated with serial order STM performance of adults with Dyslexia_HP for verbal and visual STM tasks. Relative to a group of age-matched controls, the dyslexic group showed abnormal activation in a network associated with order STM encompassing the Right_HP intraparietal and superior frontal sulcus, and this for both verbal and visual order STM conditions. This study highlights long-lasting alterations in non-language neural substrates and processes in Dyslexia_HP.

Psychophysical Evidence for Impaired Magno, Parvo, and Konio-cellular Pathways in Dyslexic Children.Dyslexia_HP is one of the most common learning disabilities affecting millions of people worldwide. Although exact causes of Dyslexia_HP are not well-known, a deficit in the magnocellular pathway may play a role. We examined possible deficiency of magnocellular, as compared to parvocellular and koniocellular pathway function by measuring luminance and Color_Perception_ASDPTO.

An investigation of NFXL1, a gene implicated in a study of specific Language_impairment_HP.A recent study identified NFXL1 as a candidate gene for specific Language_impairment_HP. The protein encoded by this gene is predicted to be a transcription factor based on domain similarities with NFX1, a repressor of HLA class II genes, which have themselves been implicated in specific Language_impairment_HP. However, there is very little literature on the function of NFXL1.

Dyslexia_HP and enhanced dynamic spatial Reasoning_ASDPTO: A review of the literature.Previous research on reading disabilities (RD) has primarily focused on the cause and expression of the disability. The vast majority of this research has focused on the disorder itself, although it has been proposed that RD embodies other qualities not necessarily related to language or reading deficits. In fact, strengths in Absent_speech_HP processing and visual-spatial talents have been proposed to exist in persons with RD. However, the limited empirical data on this matter have yielded inconsistent results. The purpose of this review was to examine this literature, focusing on research concerning dynamic and complex spatial processing or Reasoning_ASDPTO in people with Dyslexia_HP. Our review suggests that there is little evidence in support of a spatial advantage in people with Dyslexia_HP, and, in fact, the data show that RD samples most often perform worse or equal to non-RD samples. An exception to this general conclusion may be performance on holistic visualization of complex figures, where RD samples have consistently demonstrated faster response times even though accuracy rates often do not exceed that of controls. The possibility of a unique spatial processing neurology that develops through Right_HP-Left_HP hemisphere interactions in persons with RD is discussed based on preliminary fMRI data.

Are There Lower Repetition Priming Effects in Children with Developmental Dyslexia_HP? Priming Effects in Spanish with the Masked Lexical Decision Task.The aim of this study was to compare the reaction times and errors of Spanish children with developmental Dyslexia_HP to the reaction times and errors of readers without Dyslexia_HP on a masked lexical decision task with identity or repetition priming. A priming paradigm was used to study the role of the lexical deficit in dyslexic children, manipulating the Frequency_HP and length of the words, with a short Stimulus Onset_HP Asynchrony (SOA = 150 ms) and degraded stimuli. The sample consisted of 80 participants from 9 to 14 years old, divided equally into a group with a developmental Dyslexia_HP Diagnosis_ASDPTO and a control group without Dyslexia_HP. Results show that identity priming is higher in control children (133 ms) than in dyslexic children (55 ms). Thus, the "Frequency_HP" and "word length" variables are not the source or origin of this reduction in identity priming reaction times in children with developmental Dyslexia_HP compared to control children.

Location negative priming effects in children with developmental Dyslexia_HP: An event-related potential study.As the reading process is inseparable from Working_Memory_ASDPTO, inhibition, and other higher cognitive processes, the deep cognitive processing defects that are associated with Dyslexia_HP may be due to defective distraction inhibition systems. In this study, we used event-related potential technology to explore the source of negative priming effects in children with developmental Dyslexia_HP and in a group of Healthy_HP children for comparison. We found that the changes in the average response times in the negative priming and control conditions were consistent across the two groups, while the negative priming effects differed significantly between the groups. The magnitude of the negative priming effect was significantly different between the two groups, with the magnitude being significantly higher in the control group than it was in the developmental Dyslexia_HP group. These results indicate that there are deficits in distraction inhibition in children with developmental Dyslexia_HP. In terms of the time course of processing, inhibition deficits in the Dyslexia_HP group appeared during early-stage cognition selection and lasted through the response selection phase. Regarding the cerebral cortex locations, early-stage cognition selection was mainly located in the parietal region, while late-stage response selection was mainly located in the frontal and Central_HP regions. The results of our study may help further our understanding of the intrinsic causes of developmental Dyslexia_HP.

Precursors of Reading Difficulties in Czech and Slovak Children At-Risk of Dyslexia_HP.Children with preschool language difficulties are at high risk of literacy problems; however, the nature of the relationship between Delayed_speech_and_language_development_HP and Dyslexia_HP is not understood. Three hundred eight Slovak and Czech children were recruited into three groups: family risk of Dyslexia_HP, speech/language difficulties and controls, and were assessed three times from kindergarten until Grade 1. There was a twofold increase in probability of reading problems in each risk group. Precursors of 'Dyslexia_HP' included difficulties in oral language and code-related skills (phoneme awareness, letter-knowledge and rapid automatized naming); poor performance in phonological memory and vocabulary was observed in both Affected_HP and unAffected_HP high-risk peers. A two-group latent variable path model shows that early language skills predict code-related skills, which in turn predict literacy skills. Findings suggest that Dyslexia_HP in Slavic languages has its origins in early language deficits, and children who succumb to reading problems show impaired code-related skills before the Onset_HP of formal reading instruction.

Three hundred eight Slovak and Czech children were recruited into three groups: family risk of dyslexia, speech/language difficulties and controls, and were assessed three times from kindergarten until Grade 1. There was a twofold increase in probability of reading problems in each risk group. Precursors of 'dyslexia' included difficulties in oral language and code-related skills (phoneme awareness, letter-knowledge and rapid automatized naming); poor performance in phonological memory and vocabulary was observed in both affected and unaffected high-risk peers. A two-group latent variable path model shows that early language skills predict code-related skills, which in turn predict literacy skills. Findings suggest that dyslexia in Slavic languages has its origins in early language deficits, and children who succumb to reading problems show impaired code-related skills before the onset of formal reading instruction.

Dyslexic brain activation abnormalities in deep and shallow orthographies: A meta-analysis of 28 functional neuroimaging studies.We used coordinate-based meta-analysis to objectively quantify commonalities and differences of dyslexic functional brain abnormalities between alphabetic languages differing in orthographic depth. Specifically, we compared foci of under- and overactivation in dyslexic readers relative to nonimpaired readers reported in 14 studies in deep orthographies (DO: English) and in 14 studies in shallow orthographies (SO: Dutch, German, Italian, Swedish). The separate meta-analyses of the two sets of studies showed universal reading-related dyslexic underactivation in the Left_HP occipitotemporal cortex (including the visual word form area (VWFA)). The direct statistical comparison revealed higher convergence of underactivation for DO compared with SO in Bilateral_HP inferior parietal regions, but this abnormality disappeared when foci resulting from stronger dyslexic task-negative activation (i.e., deactivation relative to baseline) were Excluded_HP. Higher convergence of underactivation for DO compared with SO was further identified in the Left_HP inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) pars triangularis, Left_HP precuneus, and Right_HP superior temporal gyrus, together with higher convergence of overactivation in the Left_HP anterior insula. Higher convergence of underactivation for SO compared with DO was found in the Left_HP fusiform gyrus, Left_HP temporoparietal cortex, Left_HP IFG pars orbitalis, and Left_HP frontal operculum, together with higher convergence of overactivation in the Left_HP precentral gyrus. Taken together, the findings support the notion of a biological unity of Dyslexia_HP, with additional orthography-specific abnormalities and presumably different compensatory mechanisms. The results are discussed in relation to current functional neuroanatomical models of developmental Dyslexia_HP.

Out-of-synchrony speech entrainment in developmental Dyslexia_HP.Developmental Dyslexia_HP is a reading disorder often characterized by reduced awareness of speech units. Whether the neural source of this phonological disorder in dyslexic readers results from the malfunctioning of the primary auditory system or damaged feedback communication between higher-order phonological regions (i.e., Left_HP inferior frontal regions) and the auditory cortex is still under dispute. Here we recorded magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals from 20 dyslexic readers and 20 age-matched controls while they were listening to ∼10-s-long spoken sentences. Compared to controls, dyslexic readers had (1) an impaired neural entrainment to speech in the delta band (0.5-1 Hz); (2) a reduced delta synchronization in both the Right_HP auditory cortex and the Left_HP inferior frontal gyrus; and (3) an impaired feedforward functional coupling between neural oscillations in the Right_HP auditory cortex and the Left_HP inferior frontal regions. This shows that during speech listening, individuals with developmental Dyslexia_HP present reduced neural synchrony to low-Frequency_HP speech oscillations in primary auditory regions that hinders higher-order speech processing steps. The present findings, thus, strengthen proposals assuming that improper low-Frequency_HP acoustic entrainment affects speech sampling. This low speech-brain synchronization has the strong potential to cause Severe_HP consequences for both phonological and reading skills. Interestingly, the reduced speech-brain synchronization in dyslexic readers compared to normal readers (and its higher-order consequences across the speech processing network) appears preserved through the development from childhood to adulthood. Thus, the evaluation of speech-brain synchronization could possibly serve as a diagnostic tool for early detection of children at risk of Dyslexia_HP.

Toward Developmental Connectomics of the Human Brain.Imaging connectomics based on graph theory has become an effective and unique methodological framework for studying structural and functional connectivity patterns of the developing brain. Normal brain development is characterized by continuous and significant network evolution throughout infancy, childhood, and adolescence, following specific maturational patterns. Disruption of these normal changes is associated with neuropsychiatric developmental disorders, such as Autistic_behavior_HP or attention-deficit Hyperactivity_HP disorder. In this review, we focused on the recent progresses regarding typical and atypical development of human brain networks from birth to early adulthood, using a connectomic approach. Specifically, by the time of birth, structural networks already exhibit adult-like organization, with global efficient small-world and modular structures, as well as hub regions and rich-clubs acting as communication backbones. During development, the structure networks are fine-tuned, with increased global integration and robustness and decreased local segregation, as well as the strengthening of the hubs. In parallel, functional networks undergo more dramatic changes during maturation, with both increased integration and segregation during development, as brain hubs shift from primary regions to high order functioning regions, and the organization of modules transitions from a local anatomical emphasis to a more distributed architecture. These findings suggest that structural networks develop earlier than functional networks; meanwhile functional networks demonstrate more dramatic maturational changes with the evolution of structural networks serving as the anatomical backbone. In this review, we also highlighted topologically disorganized characteristics in structural and functional brain networks in several major developmental neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Autistic_behavior_HP, attention-deficit Hyperactivity_HP disorder and developmental Dyslexia_HP). Collectively, we showed that delineation of the brain network from a connectomics perspective offers a unique and refreshing view of both normal development and neuropsychiatric disorders.

Socioemotional Features and Resilience in Italian University Students with and without Dyslexia_HP.Dyslexia_HP is a permanent condition characterized by reading difficulties that include inaccurate or slow and effortful word reading, poor decoding, and poor spelling abilities. People with Dyslexia_HP may have psychological and psychopathological issues such as low self-esteem, poor resilience, and symptoms of Depression_ASDPTO and Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP. They may also develop social problems and emotional issues, as well as low academic and social self-efficacy. The present study aimed to assess the psychological features of a sample of 28 Italian university students with Dyslexia_HP, comparing them with a control group of typically developing students matched for gender, education, and academic discipline, to enhance our knowledge of Dyslexia_HP outcomes in an Italian setting. The results show that university students with Dyslexia_HP experience higher levels of somatic complaints, social and attentional problems, lower self-esteem, and higher Depression_ASDPTO scores than controls, while no difference emerged between the two groups' resilience scores. In conclusion, the present findings suggest that university students with Dyslexia_HP report more psychological issues than students without Dyslexia_HP and could benefit from intervention to improve their psychological and physical well-being.

A Principled Relation between Reading and Naming in Acquired and Developmental Anomia_HP: Surface Dyslexia_HP Following Impairment in the Phonological Output Lexicon.Lexical retrieval and reading aloud are often viewed as two separate processes. However, they are not completely separate-they share components. This study assessed the effect of an impairment in a shared component, the phonological output lexicon, on lexical retrieval and on reading aloud. Because the phonological output lexicon is part of the lexical route for reading, individuals with an impairment in this lexicon may be forced to read aloud via the sublexical route and therefore show a reading pattern that is typical of surface Dyslexia_HP. To examine the effect of phonological output lexicon deficit on reading, we tested the reading of 16 Hebrew-speaking individuals with phonological output lexicon Anomia_HP, eight with acquired Anomia_HP following brain damage and eight with developmental Anomia_HP. We established that they had a phonological output lexicon deficit according to the types of errors and the effects on their naming in a picture naming task, and Excluded_HP other deficit loci in the lexical retrieval process according to a line of tests assessing their picture and word comprehension, word and non-word repetition, and phonological Working_Memory_ASDPTO. After we have established that the participants have a phonological output lexicon deficit, we tested their reading. To assess their reading and type of reading impairment, we tested their reading aloud, lexical decision, and written word comprehension. We found that all of the participants with phonological output lexicon impairment showed, in addition to Anomia_HP, also the typical surface Dyslexia_HP errors in reading aloud of irregular words, words with ambiguous conversion to phonemes, and potentiophones (words like "now" that, when read via the sublexical route, can be sounded out as another word, "know"). Importantly, the participants performed normally on pseudohomophone lexical decision and on homophone/potentiophone reading comprehension, indicating spared orthographic input lexicon and spared access to it and from it to lexical semantics. This pattern was shown both by the adults with acquired Anomia_HP and by the participants with developmental Anomia_HP. These results thus suggest a principled relation between Anomia_HP and Dyslexia_HP, and point to a distinct type of surface Dyslexia_HP. They further show the possibility of good comprehension of written words when the phonological output stages are impaired.

Improvement of the Error-detection Mechanism in Adults with Dyslexia_HP Following Reading Acceleration Training.The error-detection mechanism aids in preventing error repetition during a given task. Electroencephalography demonstrates that error detection involves two event-related potential components: error-related and correct-response negativities (ERN and CRN, respectively). Dyslexia_HP is characterized by slow, inaccurate reading. In particular, individuals with Dyslexia_HP have a less active error-detection mechanism during reading than typical readers. In the current study, we examined whether a reading training programme could improve the ability to recognize words automatically (lexical representations) in adults with Dyslexia_HP, thereby resulting in more efficient error detection during reading. Behavioural and electrophysiological measures were obtained using a lexical decision task before and after participants trained with the reading acceleration programme. ERN amplitudes were smaller in individuals with Dyslexia_HP than in typical readers before training but increased following training, as did behavioural reading scores. Differences between the pre-training and post-training ERN and CRN components were larger in individuals with Dyslexia_HP than in typical readers. Also, the error-detection mechanism as represented by the ERN/CRN complex might serve as a biomarker for Dyslexia_HP and be used to evaluate the effectiveness of reading intervention programmes.

KIAA0319 gene polymorphisms are associated with developmental Dyslexia_HP in Chinese Uyghur children.The gene KIAA0319 has been reported to be associated with developmental Dyslexia_HP (DD) in previous studies, although the results have not always been consistent. However, few studies have been conducted in Uyghur populations. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the association of KIAA0319 polymorphisms and DD in individuals of Uyghurian descent. We used a custom-by-design 48-Plex SNPscan Kit to genotype 18 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of KIAA0319 in a group of 196 children with Dyslexia_HP and 196 controls of Uyghur descent aged 8-12 years. As a result, 7 SNPs (Pmin=0.001) of KIAA0319 had nominal significant differences between the cases and controls under specific genotypic models. The two SNPs rs6935076 (P=0.020 under dominant model; P=0.028 under additive model) and rs3756821 (P=0.021 under additive model) remained significantly associated with Dyslexia_HP after Bonferroni correction. Linkage disequilibrium analysis showed three blocks within KIAA0319, and only a 10-SNP haplotype in block 3 was present at significantly different frequencies in the dyslexic children and controls. This study indicated that genetic polymorphisms of KIAA0319 are associated with an increased risk of DD in the Uyghur population.

Direct Viewing of Dyslexics' Compensatory Strategies in Speech in Noise Using Auditory Classification Images.A vast majority of dyslexic children exhibit a phonological deficit, particularly noticeable in phonemic identification or discrimination tasks. The gap in performance between dyslexic and normotypical listeners appears to decrease into adulthood, suggesting that some individuals with Dyslexia_HP develop compensatory strategies. Some dyslexic adults however remain impaired in more challenging listening situations such as in the presence of background noise. This paper addresses the question of the compensatory strategies employed, using the recently developed Auditory Classification Image (ACI) methodology. The results of 18 dyslexics taking part in a phoneme categorization task in noise were compared with those of 18 normotypical age-matched controls. By fitting a penalized Generalized_HP Linear Model on the data of each participant, we obtained his/her ACI, a map of the time-Frequency_HP regions he/she relied on to perform the task. Even though dyslexics performed significantly less well than controls, we were unable to detect a robust difference between the mean ACIs of the two groups. This is partly due to the considerable Heterogeneous_HP in listening strategies among a subgroup of 7 low-performing dyslexics, as confirmed by a complementary analysis. When excluding these participants to restrict our comparison to the 11 dyslexics performing as well as their average-reading peers, we found a significant difference in the F3 Onset_HP of the first syllable, and a tendency of difference on the F4 Onset_HP, suggesting that these listeners can compensate for their deficit by relying upon additional allophonic cues.

Association of DCDC2 Polymorphisms with Normal Variations in Reading Abilities in a Chinese Population.The doublecortin domain-containing 2 (DCDC2) gene, which is located on chromosome 6p22.1, has been widely suggested to be a candidate gene for Dyslexia_HP, but its role in typical reading development over time remains to be clarified. In the present study, we explored the role of DCDC2 in contributing to the individual differences in reading development from ages 6 to 11 years by analysing data from 284 unrelated children who were participating in the Chinese Longitudinal Study of Reading Development (CLSRD). The associations of eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DCDC2 with the latent intercept and slope of children's reading scores were examined in the first step. There was significant support for an association of rs807724 with the intercept for the reading comprehension measure of reading fluency, and the minor "G" allele was associated with poor reading performance. Next, we further tested the rs807724 SNP in association with the reading ability at each tested time and revealed that, in addition to significant associations with the two main reading measures (reading fluency and Chinese character reading) over multiple testing occasions, this SNP also showed associations with reading-related cognitive skills, including morphological production, orthographic judgment and phonological processing skills (rapid number naming, phoneme deletion, and tone detection). This study provides support for DCDC2 as a risk gene for Dyslexia_HP and suggests that this gene is also operative for typical reading development in the Han population.
Association of DCDC2 Polymorphisms with Normal Variations in Reading Abilities in a Chinese Population.The doublecortin domain-containing 2 (DCDC2) gene, which is located on chromosome 6p22.1, has been widely suggested to be a candidate gene for dyslexia, but its role in typical reading development over time remains to be clarified. In the present study, we explored the role of DCDC2 in contributing to the individual differences in reading development from ages 6 to 11 years by analysing data from 284 unrelated children who were participating in the Chinese Longitudinal Study of Reading Development (CLSRD). The associations of eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DCDC2 with the latent intercept and slope of children's reading scores were examined in the first step. There was significant support for an association of rs807724 with the intercept for the reading comprehension measure of reading fluency, and the minor "G" allele was associated with poor reading performance. Next, we further tested the rs807724 SNP in association with the reading ability at each tested time and revealed that, in addition to significant associations with the two main reading measures (reading fluency and Chinese character reading) over multiple testing occasions, this SNP also showed associations with reading-related cognitive skills, including morphological production, orthographic judgment and phonological processing skills (rapid number naming, phoneme deletion, and tone detection). This study provides support for DCDC2 as a risk gene for reading disability and suggests that this gene is also operative for typical reading development in the Han population.
Spelling Errors of Dyslexic Children in Bosnian Language With Transparent Orthography.The purpose of this study was to explore the nature of spelling errors made by children with Dyslexia_HP in Bosnian language with transparent orthography. Three main error categories were distinguished: phonological, orthographic, and grammatical errors. An analysis of error type showed 86% of phonological errors,10% of orthographic errors, and 4% of grammatical errors. Furthermore, the majority errors were the omissions and substitutions, followed by the insertions, omission of rules of assimilation by voicing, and errors with utilization of suffix. We can conclude that phonological errors were dominant in children with Dyslexia_HP at all grade levels.

Rapid automatized naming (RAN) in children with ADHD: An ex-Gaussian analysis.Children with ADHD demonstrate increased Frequent_HP "lapses" in performance on tasks in which the stimulus presentation rate is externally controlled, leading to increased variability in response times. It is less clear whether these lapses are also evident during performance on self-paced tasks, e.g., rapid automatized naming (RAN), or whether RAN inter-item pause time variability uniquely predicts reading performance. A total of 80 children aged 9 to 14 years-45 children with attention-deficit/Hyperactivity_HP disorder (ADHD) and 35 typically developing (TD) children-completed RAN and reading fluency measures. RAN responses were digitally recorded for analyses. Inter-stimulus pause time distributions (excluding between-row pauses) were analyzed using traditional (mean, standard deviation [SD], coefficient of variation [CV]) and ex-Gaussian (mu, sigma, tau) methods. Children with ADHD were found to be significantly slower than TD children (p < .05) on RAN letter naming mean response time as well as on oral and silent reading fluency. RAN response time distributions were also significantly more variable (SD, tau) in children with ADHD. Hierarchical regression revealed that the exponential component (tau) of the letter-naming response time distribution uniquely predicted reading fluency in children with ADHD (p < .001, ΔR

Comorbid psychopathology and clinical symptomatology in children and adolescents with Obsessive-Compulsive_Disorder_ASDPTO.Comorbid psychopathology in children and adolescents with Obsessive-Compulsive_Disorder_ASDPTO (Obsessive-compulsive_behavior_HP) has been investigated in a number of studies over the last twenty years. The aim of the present study was to investigate the phenomenology of illness and broader psychopathology in a group of Greek children and adolescents with Obsessive-compulsive_behavior_HP. The investigation of parental psychopathology in children and adolescents with Obsessive-compulsive_behavior_HP was a secondary aim of the present study. We studied 31 children and adolescents with Obsessive-compulsive_behavior_HP (n=31, age range 8-15 years) and their parents (n=62, age range 43-48 years) and compared to children and adolescents with specific reading and written expression Learning_Disorders_ASDPTO (n=30, age range 7-16 years) and their parents (n=58, age range 40-46 years). Appropriate testing showed specific reading and Learning_Disorders_ASDPTO, which were of Mild_HP to Moderate_HP Severity_HP for the 85% of this latter group. The Diagnosis_ASDPTO of learning disorder of reading and written expression was made through the use of standardized reading material, appropriate for ages 10-15 years. Reading comprehension and narration were tested. The written expression (spelling, syntax, content) was examined by a written text, in which the subject developed a certain theme from the reading material. Based on their level of education and occupation, the index families were classified as high (29%), average (45%) and low (26%) socioeconomic status, whereas 6.7% of control families belonged to high, 63.3% to average, and 30% to low status. In order to investigate psychopathology, the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia_HP for School Aged Children, Present and Life-time version was administered to children and their parents, as well as the Child Behavior Checklist 4/18 (CBCL) to both parents and adolescents (Youth Self-Report). Also the Yale- Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) was rated for both children and parents. Moreover, the children were given the Children's Depression_ASDPTO Inventory (CDI) and the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP Scale (RCMAS). In the Obsessive-compulsive_behavior_HP group, 48% had contamination obsessions, 42% aggressive obsessions and 52% had washing and cleaning compulsions. Moreover, 32% had one additional disorder and 16.1% had two additional disorders. In comparison, only 17.2% of the control group children had one comorbid disorder. The Obsessive-compulsive_behavior_HP proband group had higher Total Problems score, as well as higher Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP/Depression_ASDPTO, Thought Problems and Externalizing scores on the CBCL. When proband parents and control parents (29 mothers and 21 fathers) were compared, the percentage of fathers in the clinical range was significantly higher in the study group (Fisher's exact test: p=0.011, two tailed), whereas for mothers the difference did not attain significance (Fisher's exact test: p=0.106, two tailed). The fathers and mothers of children with Obsessive-compulsive_behavior_HP were more clinically Affected_HP than those of controls. Mothers of probands differed from controls in compulsions, compared to fathers, who differed in both obsessions and compulsions. Comorbidity rate was higher to children and adolescents with Obsessive-compulsive_behavior_HP. A considerable number of children and adolescents with Obsessive-compulsive_behavior_HP had higher symptomatology of Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP and Depression_ASDPTO than controls, as well as higher rates of thought problems. Children and adolescents with Obsessive-compulsive_behavior_HP also exhibited higher rates of externalizing problems. This latter finding is considered as important and needs to be highlighted in terms of case management and treatment. Moreover, the parents of children and adolescents with Obsessive-compulsive_behavior_HP had more Obsessive-compulsive_behavior_HP symptomatology than the parents of children and adolescents with Learning_Disorders_ASDPTO. The symptomatology of the parents may create difficulties in interactions within the family and become burdensome for a vulnerable child. In turn, the child's symptomatology may create or increase some of the symptoms in the parents i.e. Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP and Depression_ASDPTO. These findings suggest that at least for a percentage of children and adolescents with Obsessive-compulsive_behavior_HP, parental and especially paternal influence may contribute to the development and Severity_HP of their symptoms, not only through hereditary factors but also through the control exerted and the Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP created in the family context.
Comorbid psychopathology and clinical symptomatology in children and adolescents with Obsessive-compulsive_behavior_HP.Comorbid psychopathology in children and adolescents with Obsessive-compulsive_behavior_HP (OCD) has been investigated in a number of studies over the last twenty years. The aim of the present study was to investigate the phenomenology of illness and broader psychopathology in a group of Greek children and adolescents with OCD. The investigation of parental psychopathology in children and adolescents with OCD was a secondary aim of the present study. We studied 31 children and adolescents with OCD (n=31, age range 8-15 years) and their parents (n=62, age range 43-48 years) and compared to children and adolescents with specific reading and written expression learning disorders (n=30, age range 7-16 years) and their parents (n=58, age range 40-46 years). Appropriate testing showed specific reading and learning disorders, which were of mild to moderate severity for the 85% of this latter group.

Mothers of probands differed from controls in compulsions, compared to fathers, who differed in both obsessions and compulsions. Comorbidity rate was higher to children and adolescents with OCD.

Developmental trajectories for children with Dyslexia_HP and low IQ poor readers.Reading difficulties are found in children with both high and low IQ and it is now clear that both groups exhibit difficulties in phonological processing. Here, we apply the developmental trajectories approach, a new methodology developed for studying language and cognitive impairments in developmental disorders, to both poor reader groups. The trajectory methodology enables identification of atypical versus Global_developmental_delay_HP in datasets gathered using group matching designs. Regarding the cognitive predictors of reading, which here are phonological awareness, phonological short-term memory (PSTM) and rapid automatized naming (RAN), the method showed that trajectories for the two groups diverged markedly. Children with Dyslexia_HP showed atypical development in phonological awareness, while low IQ poor readers showed Global_developmental_delay_HP. Low IQ poor readers showed atypical PSTM and RAN development, but children with Dyslexia_HP showed Global_developmental_delay_HP. These divergent trajectories may have important ramifications for supporting each type of poor reader, although all poor readers showed weakness in all areas. Regarding auditory processing, the developmental trajectories were very similar for the two poor reader groups. However, children with Dyslexia_HP demonstrated Global_developmental_delay_HP for auditory discrimination of Duration, while the low IQ children showed atypical development on this measure. The data show that, regardless of IQ, poor readers have developmental trajectories that differ from typically developing children. The trajectories approach enables differences in trajectory classification to be identified across poor reader group, as well as specifying the individual nature of these trajectories.

Development of Tract-Specific White Matter Pathways During Early Reading Development in At-Risk Children and Typical Controls.Developmental Dyslexia_HP is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a strong genetic basis. Previous studies observed Abnormality_of_the_cerebral_white_matter_HP in the Left_HP posterior brain regions in adults and school-age children with Dyslexia_HP. However, no study yet has examined the development of tract-specific white matter pathways from the pre-reading to the fluent reading stage in children at familial risk for Dyslexia_HP (FHD+) versus controls (FHD-). This study examined white matter integrity at pre-reading, beginning, and fluent reading stages cross-sectionally ( n = 78) and longitudinally (n = 45) using an automated fiber-tract quantification method. Our findings depict Abnormality_of_the_cerebral_white_matter_HP and atypical lateralization of the arcuate fasciculus at the pre-reading stage in FHD+ versus FHD- children. Moreover, we demonstrate faster white matter development in subsequent good versus poor readers and a positive association between white matter maturation and reading development using a longitudinal design. Additionally, the combination of white matter maturation, familial risk, and psychometric measures best predicted later reading abilities. Furthermore, within FHD+ children, subsequent good readers exhibited faster white matter development in the Right_HP superior longitudinal fasciculus compared with subsequent poor readers, suggesting a compensatory mechanism. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of white matter pathway maturation in the development of typical and atypical reading skills.

Machine learning and Dyslexia_HP: Classification of individual structural neuro-imaging scans of students with and without Dyslexia_HP.Meta-analytic studies suggest that Dyslexia_HP is characterized by subtle and spatially distributed variations in brain anatomy, although many variations failed to be significant after corrections of multiple comparisons. To circumvent issues of significance which are characteristic for conventional analysis techniques, and to provide predictive value, we applied a machine learning technique--support vector machine--to differentiate between subjects with and without Dyslexia_HP. In a sample of 22 students with Dyslexia_HP (20 women) and 27 students without Dyslexia_HP (25 women) (18-21 years), a classification performance of 80% (p < 0.001; d-prime = 1.67) was achieved on the basis of differences in gray matter (sensitivity 82%, specificity 78%). The voxels that were most reliable for classification were found in the Left_HP occipital fusiform gyrus (LOFG), in the Right_HP occipital fusiform gyrus (ROFG), and in the Left_HP inferior parietal lobule (LIPL). Additionally, we found that classification certainty (e.g. the percentage of times a subject was correctly classified) correlated with Severity_HP of Dyslexia_HP (r = 0.47). Furthermore, various significant correlations were found between the three anatomical regions and behavioural measures of spelling, phonology and whole-word-reading. No correlations were found with behavioural measures of short-term memory and visual/attentional Confusion_HP. These data indicate that the LOFG, ROFG and the LIPL are neuro-endophenotype and potentially biomarkers for types of Dyslexia_HP related to reading, spelling and phonology. In a second and independent sample of 876 young adults of a general population, the trained classifier of the first sample was tested, resulting in a classification performance of 59% (p = 0.07; d-prime = 0.65). This decline in classification performance resulted from a large percentage of false alarms. This study provided support for the use of machine learning in anatomical brain imaging.

Self-Reports of Increased Prospective and Retrospective Memory_impairment_HP in Adults with Developmental Dyslexia_HP.Short-term and working Memory_impairment_HP in Dyslexia_HP are well-documented, but other memory domains have received little empirical scrutiny, despite some evidence to suggest that they might be impaired. Prospective memory is memory for delayed intentions, whilst retrospective memory relates to memory for personally experienced past events. To gain an understanding of subjective everyday memory experience, a self-report measure designed to tap prospective and retrospective memory was administered to 28 adults with Dyslexia_HP and 26 IQ-matched adults without Dyslexia_HP. Adults with Dyslexia_HP reported experiencing significantly more Frequent_HP problems with memory than the adults without Dyslexia_HP. Group differences were found across seven out of the eight questionnaire scales. Further to these analyses, the participants' own ratings were compared with proxy ratings provided by close associates. The perception of poorer memory abilities in the participants did not differ between respondent types. The self-reported difficulties are, thus, unlikely to be the result of lowered self-esteem or metacognitive awareness. More Frequent_HP difficulties with both types of memory would seem, therefore, to be experienced by adults with Dyslexia_HP in everyday life. Further laboratory-based research is recommended to explore both memory domains in Dyslexia_HP and to identify the cognitive mechanisms by which these problems occur.

Knockdown of Dyslexia_HP-Gene Dcdc2 Interferes with Speech Sound Discrimination in Continuous Streams.Dyslexia_HP is the most common developmental Language_impairment_HP and is marked by deficits in reading and phonological awareness. One theory of Dyslexia_HP suggests that the phonological awareness deficit is due to abnormal auditory processing of speech sounds. Variants in DCDC2 and several other neural migration genes are associated with Dyslexia_HP and may contribute to auditory processing deficits. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that RNAi suppression of Dcdc2 in rats causes abnormal cortical responses to sound and impaired speech sound discrimination. In the current study, rats were subjected in utero to RNA interference targeting of the gene Dcdc2 or a scrambled sequence. Primary auditory cortex (A1) responses were acquired from 11 rats (5 with Dcdc2 RNAi; DC-) before any behavioral training. A separate group of 8 rats (3 DC-) were trained on a variety of speech sound discrimination tasks, and auditory cortex responses were acquired following training. Dcdc2 RNAi nearly eliminated the ability of rats to identify specific speech sounds from a continuous train of speech sounds but did not impair performance during discrimination of isolated speech sounds. The neural responses to speech sounds in A1 were not degraded as a function of presentation rate before training. These results suggest that A1 is not directly involved in the impaired speech discrimination caused by Dcdc2 RNAi. This result contrasts earlier results using Kiaa0319 RNAi and suggests that different Dyslexia_HP genes may cause different deficits in the speech processing circuitry, which may explain differential responses to therapy.

Primary auditory cortex (A1) responses were acquired from 11 rats (5 with Dcdc2 RNAi; DC-) before any behavioral training. A separate group of 8 rats (3 DC-) were trained on a variety of speech sound discrimination tasks, and auditory cortex responses were acquired following training. Dcdc2 RNAi nearly eliminated the ability of rats to identify specific speech sounds from a continuous train of speech sounds but did not impair performance during discrimination of isolated speech sounds. The neural responses to speech sounds in A1 were not degraded as a function of presentation rate before training. These results suggest that A1 is not directly involved in the impaired speech discrimination caused by Dcdc2 RNAi. This result contrasts earlier results using Kiaa0319 RNAi and suggests that different dyslexia genes may cause different deficits in the speech processing circuitry, which may explain differential responses to therapy.
Knockdown of Dyslexia-Gene Dcdc2 Interferes with Speech Sound Discrimination in Continuous Streams.Dyslexia is the most common developmental language disorder and is marked by deficits in reading and phonological awareness. One theory of dyslexia suggests that the phonological awareness deficit is due to abnormal auditory processing of speech sounds. Variants in DCDC2 and several other neural migration genes are associated with dyslexia and may contribute to auditory processing deficits. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that RNAi suppression of Dcdc2 in rats causes abnormal cortical responses to sound and impaired speech sound discrimination. In the current study, rats were subjected in utero to RNA interference targeting of the gene Dcdc2 or a scrambled sequence.

Acquired Dyslexia_HP in Serbian speakers with Broca's and Wernicke's Aphasia_HP.This study examined patterns of acquired Dyslexia_HP in Serbian aphasic speakers, comparing profiles of groups with Broca's versus Wernicke's Aphasia_HP. The study also looked at the relationship of reading and auditory comprehension and between reading comprehension and reading aloud in these groups. Participants were 20 people with Broca's and 20 with Wernicke's Aphasia_HP. They were asked to read aloud and to understand written material from the Serbian adaptation of the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia_HP Examination. A Serbian Word Reading Aloud Test was also used. The people with Broca's Aphasia_HP achieved better results in reading aloud and in reading comprehension than those with Wernicke's Aphasia_HP. Those with Wernicke's Aphasia_HP showed significantly more semantic errors than those with Broca's Aphasia_HP who had significantly more morphological and phonological errors. From the data we inferred that lesion sites accorded with previous work on networks associated with Broca's and Wernicke's Aphasia_HP and with a posterior-anterior axis for reading processes centred on (Left_HP) parietal-temporal-frontal lobes.

Effects of a Randomized Reading Intervention Study Aimed at 9-Year-Olds: A 5-Year Follow-up.The present paper reports on a 5-year follow-up of a randomized reading intervention in grade 3 in Sweden. An intervention group (n = 57) received daily training for 12 weeks in phoneme/grapheme mapping, reading comprehension and reading speed, whereas a control group (n = 55) participated in ordinary classroom activities. The main aim was to investigate if there were remaining effects of the intervention on reading-related skills. Previous analyses showed that the intervention group performed significantly better than the control group on spelling, reading speed, reading comprehension and phoneme awareness at the immediate post-test with sustained effects 1 year later. Results from the 5-year follow-up show that the only significant difference between the intervention (n = 47) and the control group (n = 37) was on word decoding. There was also a significant interaction effect of group assignment and initial word decoding, in the way that the lowest-performing students benefitted the most from the intervention. Another aim was to examine if the children identified in a screening (n = 2212) as poor readers in grade 2 still performed worse than typical readers. The analyses showed that the typically developing students (n = 66) outperformed the students identified as poor readers in grade 2 on Working_Memory_ASDPTO, spelling, reading comprehension and word decoding.

Novel Word Learning, Reading Difficulties, and Phonological Processing Skills.Visual-verbal paired associate learning (PAL) refers to the ability to establish an arbitrary association between a visual referent and an unfamiliar label. It is now established that this ability is impaired in children with Dyslexia_HP, but the source of this deficit is yet to be specified. This study assesses PAL performance in children with reading difficulties using a modified version of the PAL paradigm, comprising a comprehension and a production phase, to determine whether the PAL deficit lies in children's ability to establish and retain novel object-novel word associations or their ability to retrieve the learned novel labels for production. Results showed that while children with reading difficulties required significantly more trials to learn the object-word associations, when they were required to use these associations in a comprehension-referent selection task, their accuracy and speed did not differ from controls. Nevertheless, children with reading difficulties were significantly less successful when they were required to produce the learned novel labels in response to the visual stimuli. Thus, these results indicate that while children with reading difficulties are successful at establishing visual-verbal associations, they have a deficit in the verbal production component of PAL tasks, which may relate to a more general underlying impairment in auditory or phonological processing.

Spelling Errors in French-speaking Children with Dyslexia_HP: Phonology May Not Provide the Best Evidence.For children with Dyslexia_HP, learning to write constitutes a great challenge. There has been consensus that the explanation for these learners' delay is related to a phonological deficit. Results from studies designed to describe dyslexic children's spelling errors are not always as clear concerning the role of phonological processes as those found in reading studies. In irregular languages like French, spelling abilities involve other processes than phonological processes. The main goal of this study was to describe the relative contribution of these other processes in dyslexic children's spelling ability. In total, 32 francophone dyslexic children with a mean age of 11.4 years were compared with 24 reading-age matched controls (RA) and 24 chronological-age matched controls (CA). All had to write a text that was analysed at the graphemic level. All errors were classified as either phonological, morphological, visual-orthographic or lexical. Results indicated that dyslexic children's spelling ability lagged behind not only that of the CA group but also of the RA group. Because the majority of errors, in all groups, could not be explained by inefficiency of phonological processing, the importance of visual knowledge/processes will be discussed as a complementary explanation of dyslexic children's delay in writing.

Variations in the neurobiology of reading in children and adolescents born full term and preterm.Diffusion properties of white matter tracts have been associated with individual differences in reading. Individuals born preterm are at risk of injury to white matter. In this study we compared the associations between diffusion properties of white matter and reading skills in children and adolescents born full term and preterm. 45 participants, aged 9-17 years, included 26 preterms (born < 36 weeks' gestation) and 19 full-terms. Tract fractional anisotropy (FA) profiles were generated for five Bilateral_HP white matter tracts previously associated with reading: anterior superior longitudinal fasciculus (aSLF), arcuate fasciculus (Arc), corticospinal tract (CST), uncinate fasciculus (UF) and inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF). Mean scores on reading for the two groups were in the normal range and were not statistically different. In both groups, FA was associated with measures of single word reading and comprehension in the aSLF, AF, CST, and UF. However, correlations were negative in the full term group and positive in the preterm group. These results demonstrate variations in the neurobiology of reading in children born full term and preterm despite comparable reading skills. Findings suggest that efficient information exchange required for strong reading abilities may be accomplished via a different balance of neurobiological mechanisms in different groups of readers.

Neuro-Cognitive Intervention for Working_Memory_ASDPTO: Preliminary Results and Future Directions.Definitions of Working_Memory_ASDPTO identify it as a function of the Executive_Function_ASDPTO system in which an individual maintains two or more pieces of information in mind and uses that information simultaneously for some purpose. In academics, Working_Memory_ASDPTO is necessary for a variety of functions, including attending to the information one's teacher presents and then using that information simultaneously for problem solving. Research indicates difficulties with Working_Memory_ASDPTO are observed in children with mathematics learning disorder (MLD) and reading disorders (RD). To improve Working_Memory_ASDPTO and other Executive_Function_ASDPTO difficulties, and as an alternative to medication treatments for attention and Executive_Function_ASDPTO disorders, the Motor Cognition(2)® (MC(2)®)program was developed. Preliminary research on this program indicates statistically significant improvements in Working_Memory_ASDPTO, mathematics, and nonsense word decoding for reading. Further research on the MC(2)® program and its impact on Working_Memory_ASDPTO, as well as other areas of Executive_Function_ASDPTOing, is warranted.

Spelling performance of students with developmental Dyslexia_HP and with developmental Dyslexia_HP associated to Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_HP and Hyperactivity_HP.Purpose to analyze and classify the spelling performance according to the semiology of spelling error of children with developmental Dyslexia_HP (DD) and with developmental Dyslexia_HP associated to Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_HP and Hyperactivity_HP(DD and ADHD) comparing them to a group of children without learning process complaints. Methods Seventy students, from the third to fifth grade, participated in this study divided as follows: 32 children without complaints of learning difficulties (GI), mean age 9.5 years; 22 students with developmental Dyslexia_HP (GII), mean age 10 years; 16 scholars with developmental Dyslexia_HP associated to Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_HP and Hyperactivity_HP (GIII), mean age 9.9. Spelling skills were assessed through a standardized word dictation task. Results Data indicated that GII and GIII children presented lower performance when compared with typically developed children. There was no statistical difference between the performance of GII and GIII children regarding the score reached in spelling, although GIII children presented the lowest performance. We observed differences between GII and GIII only in the type of misspelling. Conclusion Data from this research contribute to develop better programs for intervention in the studied population.

A Special Font for People with Dyslexia_HP: Does it Work and, if so, why?In 2008 Christian Boer, a Dutch artist, developed a special font ("Dyslexie") to facilitate reading in children and adults with Dyslexia_HP. The font has received a lot of media attention worldwide (e.g., TheGuardian.com, Slate.com, TheAtlantic.com, USA Today, and io9.com). Interestingly, there is barely any empirical evidence for the efficacy of Dyslexie. This study aims to examine if Dyslexie is indeed more effective than a commonly used sans serif font (Arial) and, if so, whether this can be explained by its relatively large spacing settings. Participants were 39 low-progress readers who were learning to read in English. They were asked to read four different texts in four different font conditions that were all matched on letter display size (i.e., x-height), but differed in the degree to which they were matched for spacing settings. Results showed that low-progress readers performed better (i.e., read 7% more words per minute) in Dyslexie font than in standardly spaced Arial font. However, when within-word spacing and between-word spacing of Arial font was matched to that of Dyslexie font, the difference in reading speed was no longer significant. We concluded that the efficacy of Dyslexie font is not because of its specially designed letter shapes, but because of its particular spacing settings. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Greater Repertoire and Temporal Variability of Cross-Frequency_HP Coupling (CFC) Modes in Resting-State Neuromagnetic Recordings among Children with Reading Difficulties.Cross-Frequency_HP, phase-to-amplitude coupling (PAC) between neuronal oscillations at rest may serve as the substrate that supports information exchange between functionally specialized neuronal populations both within and between cortical regions. The study utilizes novel algorithms to identify prominent instantaneous modes of cross-Frequency_HP coupling and their temporal stability in resting state magnetoencephalography (MEG) data from 25 students experiencing Severe_HP reading difficulties (RD) and 27 age-matched non-impaired readers (NI). Phase coherence estimates were computed in order to identify the prominent mode of PAC interaction for each sensor, sensor pair, and pair of Frequency_HP bands (from δ to γ) at successive time windows of the continuous MEG record. The degree of variability in the characteristic Frequency_HP-pair PAC(f1-f2) modes over time was also estimated. Results revealed a wider repertoire of prominent PAC interactions in RD as compared to NI students, suggesting an altered functional substrate for information exchange between neuronal assemblies in the former group. Moreover, RD students showed significant variability in PAC modes over time. This temporal instability of PAC values was particularly prominent: (a) within and between Right_HP hemisphere temporo-parietal and occipito-temporal sensors and, (b) between Left_HP hemisphere frontal, temporal, and occipito-temporal sensors and corresponding Right_HP hemisphere sites. Altered modes of neuronal population coupling may help account for extant data revealing reduced, task-related neurophysiological and hemodynamic activation in Left_HP hemisphere regions involved in the reading network in RD. Moreover, the spatial distribution of pronounced instability of cross-Frequency_HP coupling modes in this group may provide an explanation for previous reports suggesting the presence of inefficient compensatory mechanisms to support reading.

Visual Illusions: An Interesting Tool to Investigate Developmental Dyslexia_HP and Autistic_behavior_HP.A visual illusion refers to a percept that is different in some aspect from the physical stimulus. Illusions are a powerful non-invasive tool for understanding the neurobiology of vision, telling us, indirectly, how the brain processes visual stimuli. There are some neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by visual deficits. Surprisingly, just a few studies investigated illusory perception in clinical populations. Our aim is to review the literature supporting a possible role for visual illusions in helping us understand the visual deficits in developmental Dyslexia_HP and Autistic_behavior_HP. Future studies could develop new tools - based on visual illusions - to identify an early risk for neurodevelopmental disorders.

Responsivity to Dyslexia_HP training indexed by the N170 amplitude of the brain potential elicited by word reading.The present study examined training effects in dyslexic children on reading fluency and the amplitude of N170, a negative brain-potential component elicited by letter and symbol strings. A group of 18 children with Dyslexia_HP in 3rd grade (9.05±0.46years old) was tested before and after following a letter-speech sound mapping training. A group of 20 third-grade typical readers (8.78±0.35years old) performed a single time on the same brain potential task. The training was differentially effective in speeding up reading fluency in the dyslexic children. In some children, training had a beneficial effect on reading fluency ('improvers') while a training effect was absent in others ('non-improvers'). Improvers at pre-training showed larger N170 amplitude to words compared to non-improvers. N170 amplitude decreased following training in improvers but not in non-improvers. But the N170 amplitude pattern in improvers continued to differ from the N170 amplitude pattern across hemispheres seen in typical readers. Finally, we observed a positive relation between the decrease in N170 amplitude and gains in reading fluency. Collectively, the results that emerged from the present study indicate the sensitivity of N170 amplitude to reading fluency and its potential as a predictor of reading fluency acquisition.

Mindful Reading: Mindfulness Meditation Helps Keep Readers with Dyslexia_HP and ADHD on the Lexical Track.This study explored the effects of a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) intervention on reading, attention, and psychological well-being among people with developmental Dyslexia_HP and/or Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_HP. Various types of Dyslexia_HP exist, characterized by different error types. We examined a question that has not been tested so far: which types of errors (and Dyslexia_HP) are Affect_ASDPTOed_HP by MBSR training. To do so, we tested, using an extensive battery of reading tests, whether each participant had Dyslexia_HP, and which errors types s/he makes, and then compared the rate of each error type before and after the MBSR workshop. We used a similar approach to attention disorders: we evaluated the participants' sustained, selective, executive, and orienting of attention to assess whether they had attention-disorders, and if so, which functions were impaired. We then evaluated the effect of MBSR on each of the attention functions. Psychological measures including mindfulness, stress, reflection and rumination, lifesatisfaction, Depression_ASDPTO, Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP, and sleep-disturbances were also evaluated. Nineteen Hebrew-readers completed a 2-month mindfulness workshop. The results showed that whereas reading errors of letter-migrations within and between words and vowelletter errors did not decrease following the workshop, most participants made fewer reading errors in general following the workshop, with a significant reduction of 19% from their original number of errors. This decrease mainly resulted from a decrease in errors that occur due to reading via the sublexical rather than the lexical route. It seems, therefore, that mindfulness helped reading by keeping the readers on the lexical route. This improvement in reading probably resulted from improved sustained attention: the reduction in sublexical reading was significant for the dyslexic participants who also had Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_HP, and there were significant correlations between reduced reading errors and decreases in Impulsivity_HP. Following the meditation workshop, the rate of commission errors decreased, indicating decreased Impulsivity_HP, and the variation in RTs in the CPT task decreased, indicating improved sustained attention. Significant improvements were obtained in participants' mindfulness, perceived-stress, rumination, Depression_ASDPTO, state-Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP, and sleep-disturbances. Correlations were also obtained between reading improvement and increased mindfulness following the workshop. Thus, whereas mindfulness training did not Affect_ASDPTO specific types of errors and did not improve Dyslexia_HP, it did Affect_ASDPTO the reading of adults with developmental Dyslexia_HP and ADHD, by helping them to stay on the straight path of the lexical route while reading. Thus, the reading improvement induced by mindfulness sheds light on the intricate relation between attention and reading. Mindfulness reduced Impulsivity_HP and improved sustained attention, and this, in turn, improved reading of adults with developmental Dyslexia_HP and ADHD, by helping them to read via the straight path of the lexical route.

Brazilian Normative Data on Letter and Category Fluency Tasks: Effects of Gender, Age, and Geopolitical Region.Verbal fluency is a basic function of language that refers to the ability to produce fluent speech. Despite being an essentially linguistic function, its measurements are also used to evaluate executive aspects of verbal behavior. Performance in verbal fluency (VF) tasks varies according to age, education, and cognitive development. Neurodevelopmental disorders that Affect_ASDPTO the functioning of frontal areas tend to cause lower performance in VF tasks. Despite the relative consensus that has been reached in terms of the use of VF tasks for the Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Dyslexia_HP and attention-deficit/Hyperactivity_HP disorder, few studies have considered regional variations in Brazil. The present study sought to provide normative data on VF tasks in children by considering gender, age, education, and geopolitical region of origin with auxiliary purposes in neuropsychological Diagnosis_ASDPTO of disorders that occur with executive changes The study included 298 participants, 7-10 years of age of both genders, who performed three letter fluency tasks and three category fluency tasks. The data were subjected to correlational and variance analyses, with age and gender as factors. No effect of gender on the children's performance was found. However, significant differences between age groups were observed, with better performance in letter tasks in older children and better performance in letter tasks compared with category tasks. Significant regional differences in performance on the letter VF task were observed. These results reinforce the importance of regional normative data in countries with high regional cultural variations, such as Brazil.

Adaptive specialization in Position_HP encoding while learning to read.The present experiments focused on how orthographic processing develops during reading acquisition. Specifically, a large, cross-sectional sample of children from grade 2 to grade 4 was exposed to pairs of words, pseudowords, digit strings, and pseudo-letter (Armenian) strings while their sensitivity to transPosition_HP (T) and substitutions (S) of internal characters was investigated in a perceptual matching task. The results showed that the development of identity and Position_HP decoding diverged between the four stimulus categories. Most importantly, sensitivity improved with longer exposure to formal education and higher reading level to both S and T pairs for digit strings, but only to S pairs for words and pseudowords. The results were successfully reproduced in two small independent samples. We propose a general framework, the Adaptive Specialization Hypothesis, to accommodate the results. According to this hypothesis, the transposed-letter effect is not a hard-wired feature of the orthographic processing system but an adaptive response of the developing orthographic system to the constraints of lexical access in several orthographies.

The precursors of double dissociation between reading and spelling in a transparent orthography.Research and clinical practitioners have mixed views whether reading and spelling difficulties should be combined or seen as separate. This study examined the following: (a) if double dissociation between reading and spelling can be identified in a transparent orthography (Finnish) and (b) the cognitive and noncognitive precursors of this phenomenon. Finnish-speaking children (n = 1963) were assessed on reading fluency and spelling in grades 1, 2, 3, and 4. Dissociation groups in reading and spelling were formed based on Stable_HP difficulties in grades 1-4. The groups were compared in kindergarten phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming, letter knowledge, home literacy environment, and task-avoidant behavior. The results indicated that the double dissociation groups could be identified even in the context of a highly transparent orthography: 41 children were unexpected poor spellers (SD), 36 were unexpected poor readers (RD), and 59 were poor in both reading and spelling (RSD). The RSD group performed poorest on all cognitive skills and showed the most task-avoidant behavior, the RD group performed poorly particularly on rapid automatized naming and letter knowledge, and the SD group had difficulties on phonological awareness and letter knowledge. Fathers' shared book reading was less Frequent_HP in the RD and RSD groups than in the other groups. The findings suggest that there are discernible double dissociation groups with distinct cognitive profiles. This further suggests that the identification of difficulties in Finnish and the Planning_ASDPTO of teaching and remediation practices should include both reading and spelling assessments.

[Development of parent’s judgment of Behavioral_abnormality_HP from kindergarten to second grade in children dependent on their reading performance: First results of a longitudinal study].The development of reading disorders is complicated by frequently occurring comorbid Behavioral_abnormality_HP. Studies have shown this relation between behavior problems and learning disabilities but the causal relation is unclear so far. The present study investigates whether and in what way parents’ judgment (CBCL) of Behavioral_abnormality_HP of children change from kindergarten to the end of second grade depending on children’s reading performance. Reading performance of 241 children was assessed every year from kindergarten to second grade. Parents judged children’s Behavioral_abnormality_HP on CBCL. Variance analyses showed that poor readers are judged higher on the CBCL problem score and on externalizing behavior in first grade in comparison to kindergarten. In kindergarten, those children who were later classified as poor readers did not differ in externalizing and internalizing symptoms from good readers, but they had more attention problems. In first and second grade poor readers showed overall more behavior problems than good readers. Also the proportion of children with clinical relevant behavior disorders increased in the group of weak readers during first and second grade. The results indicate that the confrontation with performance requirements in school put a high burden on the children.

Orthographic Reading Deficits in Dyslexic Japanese Children: Examining the Transposed-Letter Effect in the Color-Word Stroop Paradigm.In orthographic reading, the transposed-letter effect (TLE) is the perception of a transposed-letter Position_HP word such as "cholocate" as the correct word "chocolate." Although previous studies on dyslexic children using alphabetic languages have reported such orthographic reading deficits, the extent of orthographic reading impairment in dyslexic Japanese children has remained unknown. This study examined the TLE in dyslexic Japanese children using the color-word Stroop paradigm comprising congruent and incongruent Japanese hiragana words with correct and transposed-letter Position_HP. We found that typically developed children exhibited Stroop effects in Japanese hiragana words with both correct and transposed-letter Position_HP, thus indicating the presence of TLE. In contrast, dyslexic children indicated Stroop effects in correct letter Position_HP in Japanese words but not in transposed, which indicated an absence of the TLE. These results suggest that dyslexic Japanese children, similar to dyslexic children using alphabetic languages, may also have a problem with orthographic reading.

Perception of Filtered Speech by Children with Developmental Dyslexia_HP and Children with Specific Language Impairments.Here we use two filtered speech tasks to investigate children's processing of slow (<4 Hz) versus faster (∼33 Hz) temporal modulations in speech. We compare groups of children with either developmental Dyslexia_HP (Experiment 1) or speech and language impairments (SLIs, Experiment 2) to groups of typically-developing (TD) children age-matched to each disorder group. Ten nursery rhymes were filtered so that their modulation frequencies were either low-pass filtered (<4 Hz) or band-pass filtered (22 - 40 Hz). Recognition of the filtered nursery rhymes was tested in a picture recognition multiple choice paradigm. Children with Dyslexia_HP aged 10 years showed equivalent recognition overall to TD controls for both the low-pass and band-pass filtered stimuli, but showed significantly impaired acoustic learning during the experiment from low-pass filtered targets. Children with oral SLIs aged 9 years showed significantly poorer recognition of band pass filtered targets compared to their TD controls, and showed comparable acoustic learning effects to TD children during the experiment. The SLI samples were also divided into children with and without phonological difficulties. The children with both SLI and phonological difficulties were impaired in recognizing both kinds of filtered speech. These data are suggestive of impaired temporal sampling of the speech signal at different modulation rates by children with different kinds of developmental Language_impairment_HP. Both SLI and dyslexic samples showed impaired discrimination of amplitude rise times. Implications of these findings for a temporal sampling framework for understanding developmental Language_impairment_HP are discussed.

Dyslexia_HP in general practice education: considerations for recognition and support.Dyslexia_HP is a common developmental learning difficulty, which persists throughout life. It is highly likely that those working in primary care will know, or even work with someone who has Dyslexia_HP. Dyslexia_HP can impact on performance in postgraduate training and exams. The stereotypical characteristics of Dyslexia_HP, such as literacy difficulties, are often not obvious in adult learners. Instead, recognition requires a holistic approach to evaluating personal strengths and difficulties, in the context of a supportive relationship. Strategies to support dyslexic learners should consider recommendations made in formal diagnostic reports, and aim to address self-awareness and coping skills.

Instead, recognition requires a holistic approach to evaluating personal strengths and difficulties, in the context of a supportive relationship. Strategies to support dyslexic learners should consider recommendations made in formal diagnostic reports, and aim to address self-awareness and coping skills.
Dyslexia in general practice education: considerations for recognition and support.Dyslexia is a common developmental learning difficulty, which persists throughout life. It is highly likely that those working in primary care will know, or even work with someone who has dyslexia. Dyslexia can impact on performance in postgraduate training and exams. The stereotypical characteristics of dyslexia, such as literacy difficulties, are often not obvious in adult learners. Instead, recognition requires a holistic approach to evaluating personal strengths and difficulties, in the context of a supportive relationship.

Further evidence for a parent-of-origin effect at the NOP9 locus on language-related phenotypes.Specific Language_impairment_HP (SLI) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder, observed in 5-10 % of children. Family and twin studies suggest a strong genetic component, but relatively few candidate genes have been reported to date. A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) described the first statistically significant association specifically for a SLI cohort between a missense variant (rs4280164) in the NOP9 gene and language-related phenotypes under a parent-of-origin model. Replications of these findings are particularly challenging because the availability of parental DNA is required.

Dissociation between exact and approximate addition in developmental Dyslexia_HP.Previous research has suggested that number sense and language are involved in number representation and calculation, in which number sense supports approximate arithmetic, and language permits exact enumeration and calculation. Meanwhile, individuals with Dyslexia_HP have a core deficit in phonological processing. Based on these findings, we thus hypothesized that children with Dyslexia_HP may exhibit exact calculation impairment while doing mental arithmetic. The reaction time and accuracy while doing exact and approximate addition with symbolic Arabic digits and non-symbolic visual arrays of dots were compared between typically developing children and children with Dyslexia_HP. Reaction time analyses did not reveal any differences across two groups of children, the accuracies, interestingly, revealed a distinction of approximation and exact addition across two groups of children. Specifically, two groups of children had no differences in approximation. Children with Dyslexia_HP, however, had significantly lower accuracy in exact addition in both symbolic and non-symbolic tasks than that of typically developing children. Moreover, linguistic performances were selectively associated with exact calculation across individuals. These results suggested that children with Dyslexia_HP have a mental arithmetic deficit specifically in the realm of exact calculation, while their approximation ability is relatively intact.

Association, characterisation and meta-analysis of SNPs linked to general reading ability in a German Dyslexia_HP case-control cohort.Dyslexia_HP is a Severe_HP disorder in the acquisition of Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO. Several studies investigated the role of genetics for reading, writing and spelling ability in the general population. However, many of the identified SNPs were not analysed in case-control cohorts. Here, we investigated SNPs previously linked to reading or spelling ability in the general population in a German case-control cohort. Furthermore, we characterised these SNPs for functional relevance with in silico methods and meta-analysed them with previous studies. A total of 16 SNPs within five genes were included. The total number of risk alleles was higher in cases than in controls. Three SNPs were nominally associated with Dyslexia_HP: rs7765678 within DCDC2, and rs2038137 and rs6935076 within KIAA0319. The relevance of rs2038137 and rs6935076 was further supported by the meta-analysis. Functional profiling included analysis of tissue-specific expression, annotations for regulatory elements and effects on gene expression levels (eQTLs). Thereby, we found molecular mechanistical implications for 13 of all 16 included SNPs. SNPs associated in our cohort showed stronger gene-specific eQTL effects than non-associated SNPs. In summary, our results validate SNPs previously linked to reading and spelling in the general population in dyslexics and provide insights into their putative molecular pathomechanisms.

ASSESSING THE KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDES AND PRACTICES OF SCHOOL TEACHERS REGARDING Dyslexia_HP, ATTENTION-DEFICIT/ Hyperactivity_HP AND AUTISTIC SPECTRUM DISORDERS IN KARACHI, PAKISTAN.Learning impairments in children consist of a spectrum of disorders that are under diagnosed in Pakistan. Most Learning_Disorders_ASDPTO have long term consequences for a child and early detection is thus imperative. Teachers may be able to play a key role in such identification. The objective of our study was to survey knowledge, attitudes and practices of school teachers regarding Dyslexia_HP, Attention-deficit/Hyperactivity_HP disorder (ADHD) and autistic spectrum disorder, and assess their ability to identify learning disabilities.

Anomalous gray matter patterns in specific reading comprehension deficit are independent of Dyslexia_HP.Specific reading comprehension deficit (SRCD) affects up to 10 % of all children. SRCD is distinct from Dyslexia_HP (DYS) in that individuals with SRCD show poor comprehension despite adequate decoding skills. Despite its prevalence and considerable behavioral research, there is not yet a unified cognitive profile of SRCD. While its neuroanatomical basis is unknown, SRCD could be anomalous in regions subserving their commonly reported cognitive weaknesses in semantic processing or Executive_Function_ASDPTO. Here we investigated, for the first time, patterns of gray matter volume difference in SRCD as compared to DYS and typical developing (TD) adolescent readers (N = 41). A linear support vector machine algorithm was applied to whole brain gray matter volumes generated through voxel-based morphometry. As expected, DYS differed significantly from TD in a pattern that included features from Left_HP fusiform and supramarginal gyri (DYS vs. TD: 80.0 %, p < 0.01). SRCD was well differentiated not only from TD (92.5 %, p < 0.001) but also from DYS (88.0 %, p < 0.001). Of particular interest were findings of reduced gray matter volume in Right_HP frontal areas that were also supported by univariate analysis. These areas are thought to subserve executive processes relevant for reading, such as monitoring and manipulating mental representations. Thus, preliminary analyses suggest that SRCD readers possess a distinct neural profile compared to both TD and DYS readers and that these differences might be linked to domain-general abilities. This work provides a foundation for further investigation into variants of Dyslexia_HP beyond DYS.

Do dyslexic individuals present a reduced visual attention span? Evidence from visual recognition tasks of non-verbal multi-character arrays.A controversy has recently developed regarding the hypothesis that developmental Dyslexia_HP may be caused, in some cases, by a reduced visual attention span (VAS). To examine this hypothesis, independent of phonological abilities, researchers tested the ability of dyslexic participants to recognize arrays of unfamiliar visual characters. Employing this test, findings were rather equivocal: dyslexic participants exhibited poor performance in some studies but normal performance in others. The present study explored four methodological differences revealed between the two sets of studies that might underlie their conflicting results. Specifically, in two experiments we examined whether a VAS deficit is (a) specific to recognition of multi-character arrays as wholes rather than of individual characters within arrays, (b) specific to characters' Position_HP within arrays rather than to characters' identity, or revealed only under a higher attention load due to (c) low-discriminable characters, and/or (d) characters' short exposure. Furthermore, in this study we examined whether pure dyslexic participants who do not have attention disorder exhibit a reduced VAS. Although comorbidity of Dyslexia_HP and attention disorder is common and the ability to sustain attention for a long time plays a major rule in the visual recognition task, the presence of attention disorder was neither evaluated nor ruled out in previous studies. Findings did not reveal any differences between the performance of dyslexic and control participants on eight versions of the visual recognition task. These findings suggest that pure dyslexic individuals do not present a reduced visual attention span.

NRSN1 associated grey matter volume of the visual word form area reveals Dyslexia_HP before school.Literacy learning depends on the flexibility of the human brain to reconfigure itself in response to environmental influences. At the same time, literacy and disorders of literacy acquisition are heritable and thus to some degree genetically predetermined. Here we used a multivariate non-parametric genetic model to relate literacy-associated genetic variants to grey and white matter volumes derived by voxel-based morphometry in a cohort of 141 children. Subsequently, a sample of 34 children attending grades 4 to 8, and another sample of 20 children, longitudinally followed from kindergarten to first grade, were classified as dyslexics and controls using linear binary support vector machines. The NRSN1-associated grey matter volume of the 'visual word form area' achieved a classification accuracy of ~ 73% in literacy-experienced students and distinguished between later dyslexic individuals and controls with an accuracy of 75% at kindergarten age. These findings suggest that the cortical plasticity of a region vital for literacy might be genetically modulated, thereby potentially preconstraining literacy outcome. Accordingly, these results could pave the way for identifying and treating the most common learning disorder before it manifests itself in school.

The influence of reading direction on hemianopic reading disorders.Hemianopic reading impairment is a consequence of a Visual_field_defect_HP to either the Right_HP or the Left_HP side and is characterized by an increased reading time and reduced reading performance. Depending on the side of the Visual_field_defect_HP, reading will be Affected_HP differently: Patients suffering from a Visual_field_defect_HP to the Right_HP side have noticeable difficulties in reading fluently with slowing. Patients suffering from a Visual_field_defect_HP to the Left_HP usually struggle to find the beginning of a line and read more fluently. It was suggested in the literature that changing the reading direction from horizontal to vertical may be a training strategy to reduce reading problems in patients with Hemianopia_HP. The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of reading direction on reading speed in patients with Left_HP- or Right_HP-sided Visual_field_defect_HP and in Healthy_HP controls.

Cognitive and emotional Empathy_ASDPTO in typical and impaired readers and its relationship to reading competence.Studies indicate a strong relationship between Empathy_ASDPTO and language skills, but the relationship between reading and Empathy_ASDPTO remains elusive, although a shared neural substrate (the temporoparietal junction; TPJ) has been implicated in both reading and Empathy_ASDPTO. Motivated by these observations, the purpose of the current study was to examine empathic skills in a large spectrum of reading abilities, including typical readers and individuals with Dyslexia_HP, and their relationship to reading competence. We administered the Intrapersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) test, which differentiates between two subscales of Empathy_ASDPTO (cognitive and emotional Empathy_ASDPTO), to a group of participants with Dyslexia_HP and typical readers. Results indicate that the general reading score (average z scores of all reading tests) was significantly positively correlated with empathic scores. In addition, tests of specific reading abilities-decoding, reading fluency, and reading-related measures of phonological awareness-were significantly positively correlated with empathic scores. Finally, participants with Dyslexia_HP who showed low reading abilities had significantly lower scores in total Empathy_ASDPTO and cognitive Empathy_ASDPTO, as measured by the IRI test, than did typical participants with high reading abilities. Taken together, these results indicate a strong association between reading-related skills and empathic abilities and may point to involvement of the TPJ in both Empathy_ASDPTO and reading.

[Prevention of Dyslexia_HP – short-term and intermediate effects of promoting phonological awareness and letter-sound correspondence with at-risk preschool children].This study assesses the short-term and intermediate effects of preschool training stimulating phonological awareness and letter-sound correspondence for children at risk of developing Dyslexia_HP. Moreover, we examined whether training reduced the Frequency_HP of subsequent dyslexic problems.

[Attention and reading performance in children with ADHD, reading disorder and the combined condition].Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_HP (ADHD) and Dyslexia_HP co-occur more often than expected by chance. Both disorders can have Severe_HP negative impact on children’s development. The aim of the present study was to compare attention and reading performance in children with ADHD, Dyslexia_HP and the comorbid condition. Ninety-nine German children in 3rd and 4th grade with ADHD (n = 26), Dyslexia_HP (n = 22) and the comorbid condition (n = 24) compared to a Healthy_HP control group (n = 27) were assessed with a model oriented assessment battery for reading and attention. Additionally, comorbid problems were examined. Children with ADHD were characterized by difficulties in decoding and reading comprehension, while children with Dyslexia_HP showed impairments in their attentional performance. Psychometric data revealed that children with Dyslexia_HP showed both externalizing and internalizing symptoms, while children with the comorbid condition scored the highest on all psychopathological dimensions. The results suggest, that reading problems in children with ADHD might be an epiphenomenon of the task used dependent on time constraints inherent to the task. Impairments of attentional functions in children with Dyslexia_HP emphasize the importance of a sufficient diagnostic procedure for subclinical ADHD symptoms as possible comorbid disorder. Future studies should focus the impact of early treatment of attentional deficits on reading acquisition.

Basic numerical processing, calculation, and Working_Memory_ASDPTO in children with Dyscalculia_HP and/or ADHD symptoms.Deficits in basic numerical skills, calculation, and Working_Memory_ASDPTO have been found in children with developmental Dyscalculia_HP (DD) as well as children with attention-deficit/Hyperactivity_HP disorder (ADHD). This paper investigates cognitive profiles of children with DD and/or ADHD symptoms (AS) in a double dissociation design to obtain a better understanding of the comorbidity of DD and ADHD.

The nature and treatment of phonological text agraphia.Phonological Alexia_HP and agraphia are written language disorders characterised by disproportionate difficulty reading and spelling nonwords in comparison to real words. In phonological Alexia_HP, it has been shown that, despite relatively accurate reading of words in isolation, text-level reading deficits are often marked and persistent. Specifically, some individuals demonstrate difficulty reading functors and affixes in sentences, a profile referred to as phonological text Alexia_HP. In this paper, we demonstrate an analogous manifestation of the phonological impairment on text-level writing and suggest the term "phonological text agraphia". We examined four individuals with phonological Alexia_HP/agraphia who also showed disproportionate difficulty writing well-formed sentences in comparison to their grammatical competence in spoken utterances. Implementation of a phonological treatment protocol resulted in significantly improved sublexical phonology skills as well as improvements in grammatical accuracy of written narratives. These findings support the notion of a common phonological impairment underlying nonword reading/spelling deficits and sentence-level difficulties.

Home literacy environment profiles of children with Language_impairment_HP: associations with caregiver- and child-specific factors.Numerous studies suggest a positive relationship between the home literacy environment (HLE) and children's language and literacy skills, yet very little research has focused on the HLE of children with Language_impairment_HP (LI). Children with LI are at risk for reading difficulties; thus, understanding the nature and Frequency_HP of their home literacy interactions is warranted.

Neurobiological Basis of Language Learning Difficulties.In this paper we highlight why there is a need to examine subcortical learning systems in children with Language_impairment_HP and Dyslexia_HP, rather than focusing solely on cortical areas relevant for language. First, behavioural studies find that children with these neurodevelopmental disorders perform less well than peers on procedural learning tasks that depend on corticostriatal learning circuits. Second, fMRI studies in neurotypical adults implicate corticostriatal and hippocampal systems in language learning. Finally, structural and functional abnormalities are seen in the striatum in children with language disorders. Studying corticostriatal networks in developmental language disorders could offer us insights into their neurobiological basis and elucidate possible modes of compensation for intervention.

Visual naming deficits in Dyslexia_HP: An ERP investigation of different processing domains.Naming speed deficits are well documented in developmental Dyslexia_HP, expressed by slower naming times and more errors in response to familiar items. Here we used event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine at what processing level the deficits in Dyslexia_HP emerge during a discrete-naming task. Dyslexic and skilled adult control readers performed a primed object-naming task, in which the relationship between the prime and the target was manipulated along perceptual, semantic and phonological dimensions. A 3×2 design that crossed Relationship Type (Visual, Phonemic Onset_HP, and Semantic) with Relatedness (Related and Unrelated) was used. An attenuated N/P190 - indexing early visual processing - and N300 - which index late visual processing - was observed to pictures preceded by perceptually related (vs. unrelated) primes in the control but not in the dyslexic group. These findings suggest suboptimal processing in early stages of object processing in Dyslexia_HP, when integration and mapping of perceptual information to a more form-specific percept in memory take place. On the other hand, both groups showed an N400 effect associated with semantically related pictures (vs. unrelated), taken to reflect intact integration of semantic similarities in both dyslexic and control readers. We also found an electrophysiological effect of phonological priming in the N400 range - that is, an attenuated N400 to objects preceded by phonemic related primes vs. unrelated - while it showed a more widespread distributed and more pronounced over the Right_HP hemisphere in the dyslexics. Topographic differences between groups might have originated from a word form encoding process with different characteristics in dyslexics compared to control readers.

Brain mechanisms of recovery from pure Alexia_HP: A single case study with multiple longitudinal scans.Pure Alexia_HP is an acquired reading disorder, typically due to a Left_HP occipito-temporal lesion affecting the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA). It is unclear whether the VWFA acts as a unique bottleneck for reading, or whether alternative routes are available for recovery. Here, we address this issue through the single-case longitudinal study of a neuroscientist who experienced pure Alexia_HP and participated in 17 behavioral, 9 anatomical, and 9 fMRI assessment sessions over a period of two years. The origin of the impairment was assigned to a small Left_HP fusiform lesion, accompanied by a loss of VWFA responsivity and by the degeneracy of the associated white matter pathways. fMRI experiments allowed us to image longitudinally the Visual_Perception_ASDPTO of words, as compared to other classes of stimuli, as well as the mechanisms of letter-by-letter reading. The Progressive_HP improvement of reading was not associated with the re-emergence of a new area selective to words, but with increasing responses in spared occipital cortex posterior to the lesion and in contralateral Right_HP occipital cortex. Those regions showed a non-specific increase of activations over time and an increase in functional correlation with distant language areas. Those results confirm the existence of an alternative occipital route for reading, bypassing the VWFA, but they also point to its key limitation: the patient remained a slow letter-by-letter reader, thus supporting the critical importance of the VWFA for the efficient parallel recognition of written words.

A systematic review of controlled trials on visual stress using Intuitive Overlays or the Intuitive Colorimeter.Claims that coloured filters aid reading date back 200 years and remain controversial. Some claims, for example, that more than 10% of the general population and 50% of people with Dyslexia_HP would benefit from coloured filters lack sound evidence and face validity. Publications with such claims typically cite research using methods that have not been described in the scientific literature and lack a sound aetiological framework. Notwithstanding these criticisms, some researchers have used more rigorous selection criteria and methods of prescribing coloured filters that were developed at a UK Medical Research Council unit and which have been fully described in the scientific literature. We review this research and disconfirm many of the more extreme claims surrounding this topic. This literature indicates that a minority subset of dyslexics (circa 20%) may have a condition described as visual stress which most likely results from a hyperexcitability of the visual cortex. Visual stress is characterised by symptoms of visual perceptual distortions, Headache_HP, and eyestrain when viewing repetitive patterns, including lines of text. This review indicates that visual stress is distinct from, although sometimes co-occurs with, Dyslexia_HP. Individually prescribed coloured filters have been shown to improve reading performance in people with visual stress, but are unlikely to influence the phonological and memory deficits associated with Dyslexia_HP and therefore are not a treatment for Dyslexia_HP. This review concludes that larger and rigorous randomised controlled trials of interventions for visual stress are required. Improvements in the Diagnosis_ASDPTO of the condition are also a priority.

Why is the processing of global motion impaired in adults with developmental Dyslexia_HP?Individuals with Dyslexia_HP are purported to have a selective dorsal stream impairment that manifests as a deficit in perceiving visual global motion relative to global form. However, the underlying nature of the visual deficit in readers with Dyslexia_HP remains unclear. It may be indicative of a difficulty with motion detection, temporal processing, or any task that necessitates integration of local visual information across multiple dimensions (i.e. both across space and over time). To disentangle these possibilities we administered four diagnostic global motion and global form tasks to a large sample of adult readers (N=106) to characterise their perceptual abilities. Two sets of analyses were conducted. First, to investigate if general reading ability is associated with performance on the visual tasks across the entire sample, a composite reading score was calculated and entered into a series of continuous regression analyses. Next, to investigate if the performance of readers with Dyslexia_HP differs from that of good readers on the visual tasks we identified a group of forty-three individuals for whom phonological decoding was specifically impaired, consistent with the dyslexic profile, and compared their performance with that of good readers who did not exhibit a phonemic deficit. Both analyses yielded a similar pattern of results. Consistent with previous research, coherence thresholds of poor readers were elevated on a random-dot global motion task and a spatially one-dimensional (1-D) global motion task, but no difference was found on a static global form task. However, our results extend those of previous studies by demonstrating that poor readers exhibited impaired performance on a temporally-defined global form task, a finding that is difficult to reconcile with the dorsal stream vulnerability hypothesis. This suggests that the visual deficit in developmental Dyslexia_HP does not reflect an impairment detecting motion per se. It is better characterised as a difficulty processing temporal information, which is exacerbated when local visual cues have to be integrated across multiple (>2) dimensions.

Neural encoding of the speech envelope by children with developmental Dyslexia_HP.Developmental Dyslexia_HP is consistently associated with difficulties in processing phonology (linguistic sound structure) across languages. One view is that Dyslexia_HP is characterised by a Cognitive_impairment_HP in the "phonological representation" of word forms, which arises long before the child presents with a reading problem. Here we investigate a possible neural basis for developmental phonological impairments. We assess the neural quality of speech encoding in children with Dyslexia_HP by measuring the accuracy of low-Frequency_HP speech envelope encoding using EEG. We tested children with Dyslexia_HP and chronological age-matched (CA) and reading-level matched (RL) younger children. Participants listened to semantically-unpredictable sentences in a word report task. The sentences were noise-vocoded to increase reliance on envelope cues. Envelope reconstruction for envelopes between 0 and 10Hz showed that the children with Dyslexia_HP had significantly poorer speech encoding in the 0-2Hz band compared to both CA and RL controls. These data suggest that impaired neural encoding of low Frequency_HP speech envelopes, related to speech Prosody_ASDPTO, may underpin the phonological deficit that causes Dyslexia_HP across languages.

Differences between Dyslexic and Non-Dyslexic Children in the Performance of Phonological Visual-Auditory Recognition Tasks: An Eye-Tracking Study.The object of this study was to explore further phonological visual-auditory recognition tasks in a group of fifty-six Healthy_HP children (mean age: 9.9 ± 0.3) and to compare these data to those recorded in twenty-six age-matched dyslexic children (mean age: 9.8 ± 0.2). Eye movements from both eyes were recorded using an infrared video-oculography system (MobileEBT® e(y)e BRAIN). The recognition task was performed under four conditions in which the target object was displayed either with phonologically unrelated objects (baseline condition), or with cohort or rhyme objects (cohort and rhyme conditions, respectively), or both together (rhyme + cohort condition). The percentage of the total time spent on the targets and the latency of the first saccade on the target were measured. Results in Healthy_HP children showed that the percentage of the total time spent in the baseline condition was significantly longer than in the other conditions, and that the latency of the first saccade in the cohort condition was significantly longer than in the other conditions; interestingly, the latency decreased significantly with the increasing age of the children. The developmental trend of phonological awareness was also observed in Healthy_HP children only. In contrast, we observed that for dyslexic children the total time spent on the target was similar in all four conditions tested, and also that they had similar latency values in both cohort and rhyme conditions. These findings suggest a different sensitivity to the phonological competitors between dyslexic and non-dyslexic children. Also, the eye-tracking technique provides online information about phonological awareness capabilities in children.

A model to support nursing students with Dyslexia_HP.Dyslexia_HP is one of the most commonly declared disabilities in higher educational institutions in the UK. This article explores the effects of specific learning difficulties, in particular Dyslexia_HP, on pre-registration nursing students on practice placements in clinical environments. The author proposes use of the OPEL model, which provides a simple, structured framework for supporting nursing students with specific learning difficulties in practice placements. This model could be applied to clinical situations where constructive support is necessary to enable the student to achieve the standards and requirements set by the Nursing and Midwifery Council.

Goal directed behavior and Dyslexia_HP.Goal directed behavior is explained by two approaches: the first, which can be named as cybertetic (behavior is wieved as homeostatic and reflexive), and second, as cognitive approach, a learned response, (skills developed by whaching the behavior of another individual). The aim of the paper is to present a noninvasive method described as an interaction of human beings with environment, recording the electrical activity of the brain from the human scalp. Obtained results are in agreement of psychological theories that place at determined levels of age the acquisition of the capacities of Abstract_Thinking_ASDPTO and with the functional neuroanatomic studies according to which biological maturation is necessary for learning processes to develop. An acquired level of learning is in close relationship with the maturation level of the cerebral structures.

Impaired Oculomotor Behavior of Children with Developmental Dyslexia_HP in Antisaccades and Predictive Saccades Tasks.Analysis of eye movement patterns during tracking tasks represents a potential way to identify differences in the cognitive processing and motor mechanisms underlying reading in dyslexic children before the occurrence of school failure. The current study aimed to evaluate the pattern of eye movements in antisaccades, predictive saccades and visually guided saccades in typical readers and readers with developmental Dyslexia_HP. The study included 30 children (age M = 11; SD = 1.67), 15 diagnosed with developmental Dyslexia_HP (DG) and 15 regular readers (CG), matched by age, gender and school grade. Cognitive assessment was performed prior to the eye-tracking task during which both eyes were registered using the Tobii® 1750 eye-tracking device. The results demonstrated a lower correct antisaccades rate in dyslexic children compared to the controls (p < 0.001, DG = 25%, CC = 37%). Dyslexic children also made fewer saccades in predictive latency (p < 0.001, DG = 34%, CG = 46%, predictive latency within -300-120 ms with target as 0 point). No between-group difference was found for visually guided saccades. In this task, both groups showed shorter latency for Right_HP-side targets. The results indicated altered oculomotor behavior in dyslexic children, which has been reported in previous studies. We extend these findings by demonstrating impaired implicit learning of target's time/Position_HP patterns in dyslexic children.

Left_HP neglect Dyslexia_HP: Perseveration_HP and reading error types.Right_HP-brain-damaged patients may show a reading disorder termed neglect Dyslexia_HP. Patients with Left_HP neglect Dyslexia_HP omit letters on the Left_HP-hand-side (the beginning, when reading Left_HP-to-Right_HP) part of the letter string, substitute them with other letters, and add letters to the Left_HP of the string. The aim of this study was to investigate the pattern of association, if any, between error types in patients with Left_HP neglect Dyslexia_HP and Recurrent_HP Perseveration_HP (a productive visuo-motor deficit characterized by addition of marks) in target cancellation. Specifically, we aimed at assessing whether different productive symptoms (relative to the reading and the visuo-motor domains) could be associated in patients with Left_HP spatial neglect. Fifty-four Right_HP-brain-damaged patients took part in the study: 50 out of the 54 patients showed Left_HP spatial neglect, with 27 of them also exhibiting Left_HP neglect Dyslexia_HP. Neglect dyslexic patients who showed Perseveration_HP produced mainly substitution neglect errors in reading. Conversely, omissions were the prevailing reading error pattern in neglect dyslexic patients without Perseveration_HP. Addition reading errors were much infrequent. Different functional pathological mechanisms may underlie omission and substitution reading errors committed by Right_HP-brain-damaged patients with Left_HP neglect Dyslexia_HP. One such mechanism, involving the defective stopping of inappropriate responses, may contribute to both Recurrent_HP Perseveration_HP in target cancellation, and substitution errors in reading. Productive pathological phenomena, together with deficits of spatial attention to events taking place on the Left_HP-hand-side of space, shape the manifestations of neglect Dyslexia_HP, and, more generally, of spatial neglect.

The role of parieto-temporal connectivity in pure neglect Dyslexia_HP.The initial stages of reading are characterised by parallel and effortless access to letters constituting a word. Neglect Dyslexia_HP is an acquired reading disorder characterised by omission or substitution of the initial or the final letters of words. Rarely, the disorder appears in a'pure' form that is, without other signs of spatial neglect. Neglect Dyslexia_HP is linked to damage involving the inferior parietal lobe and regions of the temporal lobe, but the precise anatomical basis of the pure form of the disorder is unknown. Here, we show that pure neglect Dyslexia_HP is associated with decreased structural connectivity between the inferior parietal and Lateral_HP temporal lobe. We examined patient DM, who following biLateral_HP occipito-parietal damage presented Left_HP neglect Dyslexia_HP together with Right_HP visual field loss, but no signs of spatial neglect. DM's reading errors were Affected_HP by word length and were much more Frequent_HP for pseudowords than for existing words. Most errors were omissions or substitutions of the first or second letter, and the spatial distribution of errors was similar for stimuli presented Left_HP or Right_HP of fixation. The brain lesions of DM comprised the inferior and superior parietal lobule as well as the cuneus and precuneus of the Left_HP hemisphere, and the angular gyrus and Lateral_HP occipital cortex of the Right_HP hemisphere. Diffusion tensor imaging revealed biLateral_HP decrease of fibre tracts connecting the inferior parietal lobule with the superior and middle temporal cortex. These findings suggest that parieto-temporal connections play a significant role for the deployment of attention within words during reading.
The role of parieto-temporal connectivity in pure neglect dyslexia.The initial stages of reading are characterised by parallel and effortless access to letters constituting a word. Neglect dyslexia is an acquired reading disorder characterised by omission or substitution of the initial or the final letters of words. Rarely, the disorder appears in a'pure' form that is, without other signs of spatial neglect. Neglect dyslexia is linked to damage involving the inferior parietal lobe and regions of the temporal lobe, but the precise anatomical basis of the pure form of the disorder is unknown. Here, we show that pure neglect dyslexia is associated with decreased structural connectivity between the inferior parietal and lateral temporal lobe. We examined patient DM, who following bilateral occipito-parietal damage presented left neglect dyslexia together with right visual field loss, but no signs of spatial neglect. DM's reading errors were affected by word length and were much more frequent for pseudowords than for existing words. Most errors were omissions or substitutions of the first or second letter, and the spatial distribution of errors was similar for stimuli presented left or right of fixation. The brain lesions of DM comprised the inferior and superior parietal lobule as well as the cuneus and precuneus of the left hemisphere, and the angular gyrus and lateral occipital cortex of the right hemisphere.

Ciliary Dyslexia_HP candidate genes DYX1C1 and DCDC2 are regulated by Regulatory Factor X (RFX) transcription factors through X-box promoter motifs.DYX1C1, DCDC2, and KIAA0319 are three of the most replicated Dyslexia_HP candidate genes (DCGs). Recently, these DCGs were implicated in functions at the cilium. Here, we investigate the regulation of these DCGs by Regulatory Factor X transcription factors (RFX TFs), a gene family known for transcriptionally regulating ciliary genes. We identify conserved X-box motifs in the promoter regions of DYX1C1, DCDC2, and KIAA0319 and demonstrate their functionality, as well as the ability to recruit RFX TFs using reporter gene and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Furthermore, we uncover a complex regulation pattern between RFX1, RFX2, and RFX3 and their significant effect on modifying the endogenous expression of DYX1C1 and DCDC2 in a human retinal pigmented epithelial cell line immortalized with hTERT (hTERT-RPE1). In addition, induction of ciliogenesis increases the expression of RFX TFs and DCGs. At the protein level, we show that endogenous DYX1C1 localizes to the base of the cilium, whereas DCDC2 localizes along the entire axoneme of the cilium, thereby validating earlier localization studies using overexpression models. Our results corroborate the emerging role of DCGs in ciliary function and characterize functional noncoding elements, X-box promoter motifs, in DCG promoter regions, which thus can be targeted for mutation screening in Dyslexia_HP and ciliopathies associated with these genes.-Tammimies, K., Bieder, A., Lauter, G., Sugiaman-Trapman, D., Torchet, R., Hokkanen, M.-E., Burghoorn, J., Castrén, E., Kere, J., Tapia-Páez, I., Swoboda, P.

Opposite Associations between Individual KIAA0319 Polymorphisms and Developmental Dyslexia_HP Risk across Populations: A Stratified Meta-Analysis by the Study Population.KIAA0319 at the DYX2 locus is one of the most extensively studied candidate genes for developmental Dyslexia_HP (DD) owing to its important role in neuronal migration. Previous research on associations between KIAA0319 genetic variations and DD has yielded inconsistent results. It is important to establish a more precise estimate of the DD risk associated with these genetic variations. We carried out a meta-analysis of association studies involving KIAA0319 polymorphisms and DD risk. The results of pooled analysis indicated that none of the six investigated markers in or near the KIAA0319 gene are associated with DD. However, a stratified analysis by the study population revealed opposite associations involving KIAA0319 rs4504469 in European and Asian subgroups. The stratified analysis also showed that the KIAA0319 rs9461045 minor allele (T allele) has a protective effect in Asians. This meta-analysis has allowed us to establish the effects of specific KIAA0319 polymorphisms on DD risk with greater precision, as they vary across populations; analyzing one single nucleotide polymorphism at a time could not fully explain the genetic association for DD.

Responsiveness to Intervention in Children with Dyslexia_HP.We examined the responsiveness to a 12-week phonics intervention in 54 s-grade Dutch children with Dyslexia_HP, and compared their reading and spelling gains to a control group of 61 typical readers. The intervention aimed to train grapheme-phoneme correspondences (GPCs), and word reading and spelling by using phonics instruction. We examined the accuracy and efficiency of grapheme-phoneme correspondences, decoding words and pseudowords, as well as the accuracy of spelling words before and after the intervention. Moreover, responsiveness to intervention was examined by studying to what extent scores at posttest could directly or indirectly be predicted from precursor measures. Results showed that the children with Dyslexia_HP were significantly behind in all reading and spelling measures at pretest. During the intervention, the children with Dyslexia_HP made more progress on GPC, (pseudo)word decoding accuracy and efficiency, and spelling accuracy than the typical reading group. Furthermore, we found a direct effect of the precursor measures rapid automatized naming, verbal Working_Memory_ASDPTO and phoneme deletion on the dyslexic children's progress in GPC speed, and indirect effects of rapid automatized naming and phoneme deletion on word and pseudoword efficiency and word decoding accuracy via the scores at pretest.

Why Are Reading Difficulties Associated with Mental Health Problems?A growing literature indicates that children with reading difficulties are at elevated risk for mental health problems; however, little attention has been given to why this might be the case. Associations between reading difficulties and mental health differ substantially across studies, raising the possibility that these relationships may be ameliorated or Aggravated_by_HP risk or resilience-promoting factors. Using socio-ecological theory as a conceptual framework, we outline four potential lines of research that could shed light on why children with reading difficulties are at risk of mental health problems and identify potential targets for intervention.

Calibration of Self-Reports of Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP and Physiological Measures of Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP While Reading in Adults With and Without Dyslexia_HP.Reading difficulty has been linked to Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP in adults yet and has not been systematically studied especially in compensated adults with Dyslexia_HP. This study examined the relationships between Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP ratings and physiological arousal while reading among adults with Dyslexia_HP (RD) compared to skilled readers (SR). Nineteen compensated adults with RD and 20 SR adults were administered a battery of reading tasks and Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP self-report questionnaires. Physiological measures of arousal were recorded during text reading task. Adults with RD scored significantly lower than SR on all cognitive and reading related measures. They showed no differences on any of the self-report Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP measures. Interestingly, in the skilled readers' sample, physiological arousal while reading correlated with trait Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP. No correlations between physiological and self-reported data were found in the RD sample. These findings suggest a model of resiliency in compensated adults with reading disabilities that includes lower Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP levels and a discord between Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP reports and actual arousal rates.

Associations Between the KIAA0319 Dyslexia_HP Susceptibility Gene Variants, Antenatal Maternal Stress, and Reading Ability in a Longitudinal Birth Cohort.Maternal stress during pregnancy has been associated with detrimental cognitive developmental outcomes in offspring. This study investigated whether antenatal maternal perceived stress and variants of the rs12193738 and rs2179515 polymorphisms on the KIAA0319 gene interact to Affect_ASDPTO reading ability and full-scale IQ (FSIQ) in members of the longitudinal Auckland Birthweight Collaborative study. Antenatal maternal stress was measured at birth, and reading ability was assessed at ages 7 and 16. Reading data were available for 500 participants at age 7 and 479 participants at age 16. FSIQ was measured at ages 7 and 11. At age 11, DNA samples were collected. Analyses of covariance revealed that individuals with the TT genotype of the rs12193738 polymorphism exposed to high maternal stress during pregnancy possessed significantly poorer reading ability (as measured by Woodcock-Johnson Word Identification standard scores) during adolescence compared with TT carriers exposed to low maternal stress. TT carriers of the rs12193738 SNP also obtained lower IQ scores at age 7 than C allele carriers. These findings suggest that the KIAA0319 gene is associated with both reading ability and general cognition, but in different ways. The effect on IQ appears to occur earlier in development and is Transient_HP, whereas the effect of reading ability occurs later and is moderated by antenatal maternal stress.

Birth Weight and Early Cognitive Skills: Can Parenting Offset the Link?Objectives There is an enduring negative association between Small_for_gestational_age_HP (<2500 g) and early childhood cognitive skills. This study examines if parenting practices meaningfully contribute to or offset birth weight disparities in cognitive development prior to formal schooling. Methods This study uses the ECLS-B, a nationally representative sample of live births in the United States in 2001. Unlike studies focused on one or two measures of parenting and investment, this study considers a wide array parenting measures collected at multiple time points, tracked from before birth across 5 years of development. Results Regression results show that nearly 50 % of the low-birth-weight gap in early math and reading ability is associated with family socioeconomic status. Between-family OLS regressions show that parenting practices, including "parental interaction," "cognitive stimulation," and "parent quality", are negatively associated with Small_for_gestational_age_HP and positively associated with improved cognitive skill among all children. After adjustment for family socioeconomic status, parenting practices did little to offset (by mediation or moderation) remaining birth weight disparities in early cognitive development. Conclusions Effective parenting is positively associated with cognitive development, but parenting is not a panacea-the developmental disadvantages associated with poor child health are not linked to parenting practices. We argue that birth weight disparities are rooted in biology and cannot easily be offset by parenting practices.

Dyslexics' usage of visual priors is impaired.Human perception benefits substantially from familiarity, via the formation of effective predictions of the environment's pattern of stimulation. Basic stimulation characteristics are automatically retrieved and integrated into our perception. A quantitatively measurable manifestation of the integration of priors is known as "contraction to the mean"; i.e., perception is biased toward the experienced mean. We previously showed that in the context of auditory discrimination, the magnitude of this bias is smaller among dyslexic individuals than among good readers matched for age and general Reasoning_ASDPTO skills. Here we examined whether a similarly reduced contraction characterizes dyslexics' behavior on serial visual tasks. Using serial spatial Frequency_HP discrimination tasks, we found that dyslexics' bias toward the experiment's mean spatial Frequency_HP was smaller than that observed for the controls. Thus, dyslexics' difficulties in automatic detection and integration of stimulus statistics are domain-general. These difficulties are likely to impede the acquisition of reading expertise.

Understanding definitions of minimally verbal across instruments: evidence for subgroups within minimally verbal children and adolescents with Autistic_behavior_HP.Minimally verbal (MV) children with Autistic_behavior_HP (Autistic_behavior_HP) are often assumed to be profoundly cognitively impaired and Excluded_HP from analyses due to challenges completing standardized testing protocols. A literature aimed at increasing understanding of this subgroup is emerging; however, the many methods used to define MV status make it difficult to compare studies. Understanding how different instruments and definitions used to identify MV children Affect_ASDPTO sample composition is critical to advance research on this understudied clinical population.

Graph analysis of EEG resting state functional networks in dyslexic readers.Neuroimaging research suggested a mixed pattern of functional connectivity abnormalities in developmental Dyslexia_HP. We examined differences in the topological properties of functional networks between 29 dyslexics and 15 typically reading controls in 3rd grade using graph analysis. Graph metrics characterize brain networks in terms of integration and segregation.

Frontotemporal_Dementia_HP and language networks: cortical thickness reduction is driven by Dyslexia_HP susceptibility genes.Variations within genes associated with Dyslexia_HP result in a language network vulnerability, and in patients with Frontotemporal_Dementia_HP (FTD), language disturbances represent a disease core feature. Here we explored whether variations within three related-Dyslexia_HP genes, namely KIAA0319, DCDC2, and CNTNAP, might Affect_ASDPTO cortical thickness measures in FTD patients. 112 FTD patients underwent clinical and neuropsychological examination, genetic analyses and brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). KIAA0319 rs17243157 G/A, DCDC2 rs793842 A/G and CNTNAP2 rs17236239 A/G genetic variations were assessed. Cortical thickness was analysed by Freesurfer. Patients carrying KIAA0319 A*(AG or AA) carriers showed greater cortical thickness atrophy in the Left_HP fusiform and inferior temporal gyri, compared to KIAA0319 GG (p ≤ 0.001). Patients carrying CNTNAP2 G*(GA or GG) showed reduced cortical thickness in the Left_HP insula thenCNTNAP2 AA carriers (p≤0.001). When patients with both at-risk polymorphisms were considered (KIAA0319 A* and CNTNAP2 G*), greater and addictive cortical thickness atrophy of the Left_HP insula and the inferior temporal gyrus was demonstrated (p ≤ 0.001). No significant effect of DCDC2 was found. In FTD, variations of KIAA0319 and CNTNAP2 genes were related to cortical thickness abnormalities in those brain areas involved in language abilities. These findings shed light on genetic predisposition in defining Phenotypic_variability_HP in FTD.

When patients with both at-risk polymorphisms were considered (KIAA0319 A* and CNTNAP2 G*), greater and addictive cortical thickness atrophy of the left insula and the inferior temporal gyrus was demonstrated (p ≤ 0.001). No significant effect of DCDC2 was found. In FTD, variations of KIAA0319 and CNTNAP2 genes were related to cortical thickness abnormalities in those brain areas involved in language abilities. These findings shed light on genetic predisposition in defining phenotypic variability in FTD.
Frontotemporal dementia and language networks: cortical thickness reduction is driven by dyslexia susceptibility genes.Variations within genes associated with dyslexia result in a language network vulnerability, and in patients with Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), language disturbances represent a disease core feature. Here we explored whether variations within three related-dyslexia genes, namely KIAA0319, DCDC2, and CNTNAP, might affect cortical thickness measures in FTD patients. 112 FTD patients underwent clinical and neuropsychological examination, genetic analyses and brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). KIAA0319 rs17243157 G/A, DCDC2 rs793842 A/G and CNTNAP2 rs17236239 A/G genetic variations were assessed. Cortical thickness was analysed by Freesurfer. Patients carrying KIAA0319 A*(AG or AA) carriers showed greater cortical thickness atrophy in the left fusiform and inferior temporal gyri, compared to KIAA0319 GG (p ≤ 0.001).

Are the literacy difficulties that characterize developmental Dyslexia_HP associated with a failure to integrate letters and speech sounds?The 'automatic letter-sound integration hypothesis' (Blomert, ) proposes that Dyslexia_HP results from a failure to fully integrate letters and speech sounds into automated audio-visual objects. We tested this hypothesis in a sample of English-speaking children with dyslexic difficulties (N = 13) and samples of chronological-age-matched (CA; N = 17) and reading-age-matched controls (RA; N = 17) aged 7-13 years. Each child took part in two priming experiments in which speech sounds were preceded by congruent visual letters (congruent condition) or Greek letters (baseline). In a behavioural experiment, responses to speech sounds in the two conditions were compared using reaction times. These data revealed faster reaction times in the congruent condition in all three groups. In a second electrophysiological experiment, responses to speech sounds in the two conditions were compared using event-related potentials (ERPs). These data revealed a significant effect of congruency on (1) the P1 ERP over Left_HP frontal electrodes in the CA group and over fronto-Central_HP electrodes in the dyslexic group and (2) the P2 ERP in the dyslexic and RA control groups. These findings suggest that our sample of English-speaking children with dyslexic difficulties demonstrate a degree of letter-sound integration that is appropriate for their reading level, which challenges the letter-sound integration hypothesis.

Network dynamics in Dyslexia_HP: Review and implications for remediation.Extant neurobiological theories of Dyslexia_HP appear fractional in focusing on isolated brain regions, mechanisms, and functional pathways. A synthesis of current research shows support for an Interactive Specialization (IS) model of Dyslexia_HP involving the dysfunctional orchestration of a widely-distributed, attentionally-controlled, hierarchical, and interhemispheric circuit of intercommunicating neuronal networks. This circuitry is comprised principally of the frontostriatal-parietal cognitive control system of networks, the posterior corpus callosum, and the Left_HP arcuate fasciculus. During development, the coalescence of these functionally specialized regions, acting together, may be essential to preventing the core phonemic and phonological processing deficits defining the dyslexic phenotype. Research demonstrating an association of each with processing phonology presents the foundational outline for a comprehensive, integrative theory of Dyslexia_HP and suggests the importance of inclusive remedial efforts aimed at promoting interactions among all three networking territories.

Complex effects of Dyslexia_HP risk factors account for ADHD traits: evidence from two independent samples.Developmental Dyslexia_HP (DD) and Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_HP/Hyperactivity_HP disorder (ADHD) are among the most common neurodevelopmental disorders, whose etiology involves multiple risk factors. DD and ADHD co-occur in the same individuals much more often than would be expected by chance. Several studies have found significant bivariate heritability, and specific genes associated with either DD or ADHD have been investigated for association in the other disorder. Moreover, there are likely to be gene-by-gene and gene-by-environment interaction effects (G × G and G × E, respectively) underlying the comorbidity between DD and ADHD. We investigated the pleiotropic effects of 19 SNPs spanning five DD genes (DYX1C1, DCDC2, KIAA0319, ROBO1, and GRIN2B) and seven DD environmental factors (smoke, Spontaneous_abortion_HP, birth weight, breastfeeding, parental age, socioeconomic status, and parental education) for main, either (a) genetic or (b) environmental, (c) G × G, and (d) G × E upon inattention and Hyperactivity_HP/Impulsivity_HP. We then attempted replication of these findings in an independent twin cohort.

Normal radial migration and lamination are maintained in Dyslexia_HP-susceptibility candidate gene homolog Kiaa0319 knockout mice.Developmental Dyslexia_HP is a common disorder with a strong genetic component, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unknown. Several candidate Dyslexia_HP-susceptibility genes, including KIAA0319, DYX1C1, and DCDC2, have been identified in humans. RNA interference experiments targeting these genes in rat embryos have shown impairments in neuronal migration, suggesting that defects in radial cortical migration could be involved in the disease mechanism of Dyslexia_HP. Here we present the first characterisation of a Kiaa0319 knockout mouse line. Animals lacking KIAA0319 protein do not show anatomical abnormalities in any of the layered structures of the brain. Neurogenesis and radial migration of cortical projection neurons are not altered, and the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of Kiaa0319-deficient neurons do not differ from those of wild-type neurons. Kiaa0319 overexpression in cortex delays radial migration, but does not Affect_ASDPTO final neuronal Position_HP. However, knockout animals show subtle differences suggesting possible alterations in Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP-related behaviour and in sensorimotor gating. Our results do not reveal a migration disorder in the mouse model, adding to the body of evidence available for Dcdc2 and Dyx1c1 that, unlike in the rat in utero knockdown models, the Dyslexia_HP-susceptibility candidate mouse homolog genes do not play an evident role in neuronal migration. However, KIAA0319 protein expression seems to be restricted to the brain, not only in early developmental stages but also in adult mice, indicative of a role of this protein in brain function. The constitutive and conditional knockout lines reported here will be useful tools for further functional analyses of Kiaa0319.

Atypical Right_HP hemisphere response to slow temporal modulations in children with developmental Dyslexia_HP.Phase entrainment of neuronal oscillations is thought to play a Central_HP role in encoding speech. Children with developmental Dyslexia_HP show impaired phonological processing of speech, proposed theoretically to be related to atypical phase entrainment to slower temporal modulations in speech (<10Hz). While studies of children with Dyslexia_HP have found atypical phase entrainment in the delta band (~2Hz), some studies of adults with developmental Dyslexia_HP have shown impaired entrainment in the low gamma band (~35-50Hz). Meanwhile, studies of neurotypical adults suggest asymmetric temporal sensitivity in auditory cortex, with preferential processing of slower modulations by Right_HP auditory cortex, and faster modulations processed bilaterally. Here we compared neural entrainment to slow (2Hz) versus faster (40Hz) amplitude-modulated noise using fNIRS to study possible hemispheric asymmetry effects in children with developmental Dyslexia_HP. We predicted atypical Right_HP hemisphere responding to 2Hz modulations for the children with Dyslexia_HP in comparison to control children, but equivalent responding to 40Hz modulations in both hemispheres. Analyses of HbO concentration revealed a Right_HP-lateralised region focused on the supra-marginal gyrus that was more active in children with Dyslexia_HP than in control children for 2Hz stimulation. We discuss possible links to linguistic prosodic processing, and interpret the data with respect to a neural 'temporal sampling' framework for conceptualizing the phonological deficits that characterise children with developmental Dyslexia_HP across languages.

Search, Read and Write: An Inquiry into Web Accessibility for People with Dyslexia_HP.Universal design in context of digitalisation has become an integrated part of international conventions and national legislations. A goal is to make the Web accessible for people of different genders, ages, backgrounds, cultures and physical, sensory and cognitive abilities. Political demands for universally designed solutions have raised questions about how it is achieved in practice. Developers, designers and legislators have looked towards the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) for answers. WCAG 2.0 has become the de facto standard for universal design on the Web. Some of the guidelines are directed at the general population, while others are targeted at more specific user groups, such as the visually impaired or hearing impaired. Issues related to cognitive impairments such as Dyslexia_HP receive less attention, although Dyslexia_HP is prevalent in at least 5-10% of the population. Navigation and search are two common ways of using the Web. However, while navigation has received a fair amount of attention, search systems are not explicitly included, although search has become an important part of people's daily routines. This paper discusses WCAG in the context of Dyslexia_HP for the Web in general and search user interfaces specifically. Although certain guidelines address topics that Affect_ASDPTO Dyslexia_HP, WCAG does not seem to fully accommodate users with Dyslexia_HP.

Multipoint genome-wide linkage scan for nonword repetition in a multigenerational family further supports chromosome 13q as a locus for verbal trait disorders.Verbal trait disorders encompass a wide range of conditions and are marked by deficits in five domains that impair a person's ability to communicate: speech, language, reading, spelling, and writing. Nonword repetition is a robust endophenotype for verbal trait disorders that is sensitive to cognitive processes critical to verbal development, including auditory processing, phonological Working_Memory_ASDPTO, and motor Planning_ASDPTO and programming. In the present study, we present a six-generation extended pedigree with a history of verbal trait disorders. Using genome-wide multipoint variance component linkage analysis of nonword repetition, we identified a region spanning chromosome 13q14-q21 with LOD = 4.45 between 52 and 55 cM, spanning approximately 5.5 Mb on chromosome 13. This region overlaps with SLI3, a locus implicated in Dyslexia_HP in families with a history of specific Language_impairment_HP. Our study of a large multigenerational family with verbal trait disorders further implicates the SLI3 region in verbal trait disorders. Future studies will further refine the specific causal genetic factors in this locus on chromosome 13q that contribute to language traits.

When transparency is opaque: Effects of diacritic marks and vowel letters on dyslexic Hebrew readers.The current study examined the effects of orthographic transparency and familiarity on brain mechanisms involved in word recognition in adult dyslexic Hebrew readers. We compared functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) brain activation in 21 dyslexic readers and 22 typical readers, and examined the effects of diacritic marks that provide transparent but less familiar information and vowel letters that increase orthographic transparency without compromising familiarity. Dyslexic readers demonstrated reduced activation in Left_HP supramarginal gyrus (SMG) as compared to typical readers, as well as different patterns of activation within the Left_HP inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Furthermore, in contrast to typical readers, dyslexic readers did not show increased activation for diacritics in Left_HP temporo-parietal junction regions, associated with mapping orthography to phonology. Nevertheless, both groups showed the facilitation effect of vowel letters on regions associated with lexical-semantic access. Altogether the results suggest that while typical readers can compensate for the reduced familiarity of pointed words with increased reliance on decoding of smaller units, dyslexic readers do not, and therefore they show a higher cost.

Neural changes associated to procedural learning and automatization process in Developmental Coordination Disorder and/or Developmental Dyslexia_HP.Recent theories hypothesize that procedural learning may support the Frequent_HP overlap between neurodevelopmental disorders. The neural circuitry supporting procedural learning includes, among others, cortico-cerebellar and cortico-striatal loops. Alteration of these loops may account for the Frequent_HP comorbidity between Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) and Developmental Dyslexia_HP (DD). The aim of our study was to investigate cerebral changes due to the learning and automatization of a sequence learning task in children with DD, or DCD, or both disorders.

Examining the relationship between home literacy environment and neural correlates of phonological processing in beginning readers with and without a familial risk for Dyslexia_HP: an fMRI study.Developmental Dyslexia_HP is a language-based learning disability characterized by persistent difficulty in learning to read. While an understanding of genetic contributions is emerging, the ways the environment affects brain functioning in children with developmental Dyslexia_HP are poorly understood. A relationship between the home literacy environment (HLE) and neural correlates of reading has been identified in typically developing children, yet it remains unclear whether similar effects are observable in children with a genetic predisposition for Dyslexia_HP. Understanding environmental contributions is important given that we do not understand why some genetically at-risk children do not develop Dyslexia_HP. Here, we investigate for the first time the relationship between HLE and the neural correlates of phonological processing in beginning readers with (FHD+, n = 29) and without (FHD-, n = 21) a Family_history_HP of developmental Dyslexia_HP. We further controlled for socioeconomic status to isolate the neurobiological mechanism by which HLE affects reading development. Group differences revealed stronger correlation of HLE with brain activation in the Left_HP inferior/middle frontal and Right_HP fusiform gyri in FHD- compared to FHD+ children, suggesting greater impact of HLE on manipulation of phonological codes and recruitment of orthographic representations in typically developing children. In contrast, activation in the Right_HP precentral gyrus showed a significantly stronger correlation with HLE in FHD+ compared to FHD- children, suggesting emerging compensatory networks in genetically at-risk children. Overall, our results suggest that genetic predisposition for Dyslexia_HP alters contributions of HLE to early reading skills before formal reading instruction, which has important implications for educational practice and intervention models.

Morphology and spelling in French students with Dyslexia_HP: the case of silent final letters.Spelling is a challenge for individuals with Dyslexia_HP. Phoneme-to-grapheme correspondence rules are highly inconsistent in French, which make them very difficult to master, in particular for dyslexics. One Recurrent_HP manifestation of this inconsistency is the presence of silent letters at the end of words. Many of these silent letters perform a morphological function. The current study examined whether students with Dyslexia_HP (aged between 10 and 15 years) benefit from the morphological status of silent final letters when spelling. We compared, their ability to spell words with silent final letters that are either morphologically justified (e.g., tricot, "knit," where the final "t" is pronounced in morphologically related words such as tricoter, "to knit" and tricoteur "knitter") or not morphologically justified (e.g., effort, "effort") to that of a group of younger children matched for reading and spelling level. Results indicated that the dyslexic students' spelling of silent final letters was impaired in comparison to the control group. Interestingly, morphological status helped the dyslexics improve the accuracy of their choice of final letters, contrary to the control group. This finding provides new evidence of morphological processing in Dyslexia_HP during spelling.

Is There a Relationship Between Speech Identification in Noise and Categorical Perception in Children With Dyslexia_HP?Children with Dyslexia_HP have been suggested to experience deficits in both categorical perception (CP) and speech identification in noise (SIN) perception. However, results regarding both abilities are inconsistent, and the relationship between them is still unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between CP and the psychometric function of SIN perception.

A longitudinal study on predictors of early calculation development among young children at risk for learning difficulties.The purpose of this study was to explore domain-general cognitive skills, domain-specific academic skills, and demographic characteristics that are associated with calculation development from first grade to third grade among young children with learning difficulties. Participants were 176 children identified with reading and mathematics difficulties at the beginning of first grade. Data were collected on Working_Memory_ASDPTO, language, Absent_speech_HP Reasoning_ASDPTO, processing speed, decoding, numerical competence, incoming calculations, socioeconomic status, and gender at the beginning of first grade and on calculation performance at four time points: the beginning of first grade, the end of first grade, the end of second grade, and the end of third grade. Latent growth modeling analysis showed that numerical competence, incoming calculation, processing speed, and decoding skills significantly explained the variance in calculation performance at the beginning of first grade. Numerical competence and processing speed significantly explained the variance in calculation performance at the end of third grade. However, numerical competence was the only significant predictor of calculation development from the beginning of first grade to the end of third grade. Implications of these findings for early calculation instructions among young at-risk children are discussed.
A longitudinal study on predictors of early calculation development among young children at risk for learning difficulties.The purpose of this study was to explore domain-general cognitive skills, domain-specific academic skills, and demographic characteristics that are associated with calculation development from first grade to third grade among young children with learning difficulties. Participants were 176 children identified with reading and mathematics difficulties at the beginning of first grade. Data were collected on working memory, language, nonverbal reasoning, processing speed, decoding, numerical competence, incoming calculations, socioeconomic status, and gender at the beginning of first grade and on calculation performance at four time points: the beginning of first grade, the end of first grade, the end of second grade, and the end of third grade. Latent growth modeling analysis showed that numerical competence, incoming calculation, processing speed, and decoding skills significantly explained the variance in calculation performance at the beginning of first grade. Numerical competence and processing speed significantly explained the variance in calculation performance at the end of third grade. However, numerical competence was the only significant predictor of calculation development from the beginning of first grade to the end of third grade. Implications of these findings for early calculation instructions among young at-risk children are discussed.
When Left_HP-hemisphere reading is compromised: Comparing reading ability in participants after Left_HP cerebral hemispherectomy and participants with developmental Dyslexia_HP.We investigated reading skills in individuals who have undergone Left_HP cerebral hemispherectomy and in readers with developmental Dyslexia_HP to understand diverse characteristics contributing to reading difficulty. Although Dyslexia_HP is a developmental disorder, Left_HP hemispherectomy requires that patients (re)establish the language process needed to perform the language-based tasks in the nondominant (Right_HP) hemisphere to become readers.

The Profiles of Students With Significant Cognitive Disabilities and Known Hearing_impairment_HP.The present study describes the characteristics of students in Grades 3-12 with significant cognitive disabilities (SCD) and known Hearing_impairment_HP. The study analyzed results of a survey of teachers of students with SCD (n = 38,367) who were slated to participate in an alternate assessment based on alternate achievement standards in 14 states in the United States. Analysis revealed similar profiles in academic achievement and symbolic language use combined with an increased incidence of additional sensory impairments among students with SCD and known Hearing_impairment_HP compared to their peers without known Hearing_impairment_HP. Results suggest that Hearing_impairment_HP may be underidentified and underserved among students with SCD and point to the need for improved hearing screenings and evaluations combined with services delivered by teams that follow a model of interprofessional practice.

Predicting early signs of Dyslexia_HP at a preliterate age by combining behavioral assessment with structural MRI.Recent studies suggest that neurobiological anomalies are already detectable in pre-school children with a Family_history_HP of developmental Dyslexia_HP (DD). However, there is a lack of longitudinal studies showing a direct link between those differences at a preliterate age and the subsequent literacy difficulties seen in school. It is also not clear whether the prediction of DD in pre-school children can be significantly improved when considering neurobiological predictors, compared to models based on behavioral literacy precursors only.

The Effect of Colored Overlays on Reading Fluency in Individuals with Dyslexia_HP.Colored overlays, one type of tinted filter, are plastic reading sheets tinted with color and placed over text to eliminate or alleviate a wide range of reading difficulties such as low reading rate, accuracy, and comprehension. The effects of colored overlays on reading problems associated with Dyslexia_HP were investigated in this study via a multielement design. Reading fluency was assessed when participants read with and without colored overlays. Undifferentiated responding, or decreased accuracy, resulted across three participants, suggesting that colored overlays were ineffective and potentially detrimental to participants' reading abilities. As a result, empirically validated reading techniques were implemented across individuals. These findings are discussed and recommendations are made in regards to the use of research-based reading interventions.

People with Dyslexia_HP and heart, chest, skin, digestive, musculoskeletal, vision, learning, speech and Mental_Disorders_ASDPTO were more dissatisfied with neighbourhoods: Scottish Household Survey, 2007-2008.Rarely do we know the perception toward neighbourhoods in people specifically with health conditions. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to understand the perception toward neighbourhoods among adults with a series of the existing health conditions in a country-wide and population-based setting. Data were retrieved from and analysed in Scottish Household Survey, 2007-2008. Information on demographics, self-reported health conditions and perception toward neighbourhoods and the surrounding facilities was obtained by household interview. Analysis including chi-square test, t test and logistic regression modelling were performed. Of 19,150 Scottish adults (aged 16-80) included in the study cohort, 1079 (7.7 %) people were dissatisfied with their living areas; particularly for those who experienced harassment (15.4 %), did not recycle or with Dyslexia_HP, chest, digestive, mental and musculoskeletal problems. Twenty to forty per cent reported common neighbourhood problems including noise, rubbish, disputes, graffiti, harassment and drug misuse. People with heart or digestive problems were more dissatisfied with the existing parks and open space. People with Arthritis_HP, chest or hearing problems were more dissatisfied with the waste management condition. People with Dyslexia_HP were more dissatisfied with the existing public transportation. People with heart problems were more dissatisfied with the current street cleaning condition. People with hearing, vision, speech, learning problems or Dyslexia_HP were also more dissatisfied with sports and recreational facilities. People with heart, chest, skin, digestive, musculoskeletal, vision, learning, speech and Mental_Disorders_ASDPTO and Dyslexia_HP were more dissatisfied with their current neighbourhood environments. Upgrading neighbourhood Planning_ASDPTO to tackle social environment injustice and put pleasant life experience as priorty would be suggested.

The effects of letter spacing and coloured overlays on reading speed and accuracy in adult Dyslexia_HP.Zorzi et al. (2012, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 109, 11455) found evidence that extra-large letter spacing aids children with Dyslexia_HP, but the evidence for the coloured overlays is contradictory (e.g., Henderson et al., 2013, J. Res. Special Educ. Needs, 13, 57; Wilkins, 2002, Ophthalmic Physiol. Opt., 22, 448), and possible combined advantages have not been identified.

Dichotic listening as an index of lateralization of speech perception in familial risk children with and without Dyslexia_HP.Atypical language lateralization has been marked as one of the factors that may contribute to the development of Dyslexia_HP. Indeed, atypical lateralization of linguistic functions such as speech processing in Dyslexia_HP has been demonstrated using neuroimaging studies, but also using the behavioral dichotic listening (DL) method. However, so far, DL results have been mixed. The current study assesses lateralization of speech processing by using DL in a sample of children at familial risk (FR) for Dyslexia_HP. In order to determine whether atypical lateralization of speech processing relates to reading ability, or is a correlate of being at familial risk, the current study compares the Laterality_HP index of FR children who did and did not become dyslexic, and a control group of readers without Dyslexia_HP. DL was tested in 3rd grade and in 5/6th grade. Results indicate that at both time points, all three groups have a Right_HP ear advantage, indicative of more pronounced Left_HP-hemispheric processing. However, the FR-dyslexic children are less good at reporting from the Left_HP ear than controls and FR-nondyslexic children. This impediment relates to reading fluency.

Difficulties in auditory organization as a cause of reading backwardness? An auditory neuroscience perspective.Over 30 years ago, it was suggested that difficulties in the 'auditory organization' of word forms in the mental lexicon might cause reading difficulties. It was proposed that children used parameters such as rhyme and alliteration to organize word forms in the mental lexicon by acoustic similarity, and that such organization was impaired in developmental Dyslexia_HP. This literature was based on an 'oddity' measure of children's sensitivity to rhyme (e.g. wood, book, good) and alliteration (e.g. sun, sock, rag). The 'oddity' task revealed that children with Dyslexia_HP were significantly poorer at identifying the 'odd word out' than younger children without reading difficulties. Here we apply a novel modelling approach drawn from auditory neuroscience to study the possible sensory basis of the auditory organization of rhyming and non-rhyming words by children. We utilize a novel Spectral-Amplitude Modulation Phase Hierarchy (S-AMPH) approach to analysing the spectro-temporal structure of rhyming and non-rhyming words, aiming to illuminate the potential acoustic cues used by children as a basis for phonological organization. The S-AMPH model assumes that speech encoding depends on neuronal oscillatory entrainment to the amplitude modulation (AM) hierarchy in speech. Our results suggest that phonological similarity between rhyming words in the oddity task depends crucially on slow (delta band) modulations in the speech envelope. Contrary to linguistic assumptions, therefore, auditory organization by children may not depend on phonemic information for this task. Linguistically, it is assumed that 'book' does not rhyme with 'wood' and 'good' because the final phoneme differs. However, our auditory analysis suggests that the acoustic cues to this phonological dissimilarity depend primarily on the slower amplitude modulations in the speech envelope, thought to carry prosodic information. Therefore, the oddity task may help in detecting reading difficulties because phonological similarity judgements about rhyme reflect sensitivity to slow amplitude modulation patterns. Slower amplitude modulations are known to be detected less efficiently by children with Dyslexia_HP.

Reading in Dyslexia_HP across literacy development: A longitudinal study of effective connectivity.Dyslexia_HP is a literacy disorder affecting the efficient acquisition of Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO skills. The disorder is neurobiological in origin. Due to its developmental nature, longitudinal studies of Dyslexia_HP are of essence. They are, however, relatively scarce. The present study took a longitudinal approach to cortical connectivity of brain imaging data in reading tasks in children with Dyslexia_HP and children with typical reading development. The participants were followed with repeated measurements through Pre-literacy (6 years old), Emergent Literacy (8 years old) and Literacy (12 years old) stages, using Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) when analysing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Even though there are a few longitudinal studies on effective connectivity in typical reading, to our knowledge, no studies have previously investigated these issues in relation to Dyslexia_HP. We set up a model of a brain reading network involving five cortical regions (inferior frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, and occipito-temporal cortex). Using DCM, connectivity measures were calculated for each connection in the model. These measures were further analysed using factorial ANOVA. The results showed that the difference between groups centred on connections going to and from the inferior frontal gyrus (two connections) and the occipito-temporal cortex (three connections). For all five connections, the typical group showed Stable_HP or decreasing connectivity measures. The Dyslexia_HP group, on the other hand, showed a marked up-regulation (occipito-temporal connections) or down-regulation (inferior frontal gyrus connections) from 6 years to 8 years, followed by normalization from 8 years to 12 years. We interpret this as a delay in the Dyslexia_HP group in developing into the Pre-literacy and Emergent literacy stages. This delay could possibly be detrimental to literacy development. By age 12, there was no statistically significant difference in connectivity between the groups, but differences in literacy skills were still present, and were in fact larger than when measured at younger ages.

Phonological skills, visual attention span, and visual stress in developmental Dyslexia_HP.In this study, we concurrently investigated 3 possible causes of Dyslexia_HP-a phonological deficit, visual stress, and a reduced visual attention span-in a large population of 164 dyslexic and 118 control French children, aged between 8 and 13 years old. We found that most dyslexic children showed a phonological deficit, either in terms of response accuracy (92.1% of the sample), speed (84.8%), or both (79.3%). Deficits in visual attention span, as measured by partial report ability, Affected_HP 28.1% of dyslexic participants, all of which also showed a phonological deficit. Visual stress, as measured by subjective reports of visual discomfort, Affected_HP 5.5% of dyslexic participants, not more than controls (8.5%). Although phonological variables explained a large amount of variance in literacy skills, visual variables did not explain any additional variance. Finally, children with comorbid phonological and visual deficits did not show more Severe_HP Dyslexia_HP than children with a pure phonological deficit. These results (a) confirm the importance of phonological deficits in Dyslexia_HP; (b) suggest that visual attention span may play a role, but a minor one, at least in this population; (c) do not support any involvement of visual stress in Dyslexia_HP. Among the factors that may explain some differences with previously published studies, the present sample is characterized by very stringent inclusion criteria, in terms of the Severity_HP of Dyslexia_HP and in terms of exclusion of Comorbidities_ASDPTO. This may exacerbate the role of phonological deficits to the detriment of other factors playing a role in reading acquisition. (PsycINFO Database Record

An Extension of the Procedural Deficit Hypothesis from Developmental Language Disorders to Mathematical Disability.Mathematical disability (MD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting math abilities. Here, we propose a new explanatory account of MD, the procedural deficit hypothesis (PDH), which may further our understanding of the disorder. According to the PDH of MD, abnormalities of brain structures subserving the procedural memory system can lead to difficulties with math skills learned in this system, as well as problems with other functions that depend on these brain structures. This brain-based account is motivated in part by the high comorbidity between MD and language disorders such as Dyslexia_HP that may be explained by the PDH, and in part by the likelihood that learning automatized math skills should depend on procedural memory. Here, we first lay out the PDH of MD, and present specific predictions. We then examine the existing literature for each prediction, while pointing out weaknesses and gaps to be addressed by future research. Although we do not claim that the PDH is likely to fully explain MD, we do suggest that the hypothesis could have substantial explanatory power, and that it provides a useful theoretical framework that may advance our understanding of the disorder.

Can psychiatric childhood disorders be due to inborn errors of metabolism?Many patients who visit a centre for hereditary metabolic diseases remarkably also suffer from a child psychiatric disorder. Those child Behavioral_abnormality_HP may be the first sign or manifestation of an underlying metabolic disorder. Lack of knowledge of metabolic disorders in child psychiatry may lead to diagnoses being missed. Patients therefore are also at risk for not accessing efficacious treatment and proper counselling. To search the literature for the co-occurrence of child Behavioral_abnormality_HP, such as ADHD, Autism_HP, Psychosis_HP, Learning_Disorders_ASDPTO and eating disorders and metabolic disorders. A search of the literature was conducted by performing a broad search on PubMed, using the terms "ADHD and metabolic disorders", "Autism_HP and metabolic disorders", "Psychosis_HP and metabolic disorders", "Learning_Disorders_ASDPTO and metabolic disorders", and "eating disorders and metabolic disorders". Based on inclusion criteria (concerning a clear psychiatric disorder and concerning a metabolic disorder) 4441 titles and 249 abstracts were screened and resulted in 71 relevant articles. This thorough literature search provides child and adolescent psychiatrists with an overview of metabolic disorders associated with child psychiatric symptoms, their main characteristics and recommendations for further investigations.

Multi-parameter machine learning approach to the neuroanatomical basis of developmental Dyslexia_HP.Despite decades of research, the anatomical abnormalities associated with developmental Dyslexia_HP are still not fully described. Studies have focused on between-group comparisons in which different neuroanatomical measures were generally explored in isolation, disregarding potential interactions between regions and measures. Here, for the first time a multivariate classification approach was used to investigate grey matter disruptions in children with Dyslexia_HP in a large (N = 236) multisite sample. A variety of cortical morphological features, including volumetric (volume, thickness and area) and geometric (folding index and mean curvature) measures were taken into account and generalizability of classification was assessed with both 10-fold and leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) techniques. Classification into control vs. dyslexic subjects achieved above chance accuracy (AUC = 0.66 and ACC = 0.65 in the case of 10-fold CV, and AUC = 0.65 and ACC = 0.64 using LOOCV) after principled feature selection. Features that discriminated between dyslexic and control children were exclusively situated in the Left_HP hemisphere including superior and middle temporal gyri, subparietal sulcus and prefrontal areas. They were related to geometric properties of the cortex, with generally higher mean curvature and a greater folding index characterizing the dyslexic group. Our results support the hypothesis that an atypical curvature pattern with extra folds in Left_HP hemispheric perisylvian regions characterizes Dyslexia_HP.

Is Reading Impairment Associated with Enhanced Holistic Processing in Comparative Visual Search?This study explores a proposition that individuals with Dyslexia_HP develop enhanced Peripheral_HP vision to process visual-spatial information holistically. Participants included 18 individuals diagnosed with Dyslexia_HP and 18 who were not. The experiment used a comparative visual search design consisting of two blocks of 72 trials. Each trial presented two halves of the display each comprising three kinds of shapes in three colours to be compared side-by-side. Participants performed a conjunctive search to ascertain whether the two halves were identical. In the first block, participants were provided no instruction regarding the visual-spatial processing strategy they were to employ. In the second block, participants were instructed to use a holistic processing strategy-to defocus their attention and perform the comparison by examining the whole screen at once. The results did not support the hypothesis associating Dyslexia_HP with talents for holistic visual processing. Using holistic processing strategy, both groups scored lower in accuracy and reacted faster, compared to the first block. Impaired readers consistently reacted more slowly and did not exhibit enhanced accuracy. Given the extant evidence of strengths for holistic visual processing in impaired readers, these findings are important because they suggest such strengths may be task dependent.

Reading Processes of University Students with Dyslexia_HP - An Examination of the Relationship between Oral Reading and Reading Comprehension.The purpose of this study was to examine the quality of oral reading and how it relates to reading comprehension in students with Dyslexia_HP. A group of Danish university students with Dyslexia_HP (n = 16) and a comparison group of students with no history of reading problems (n = 16) were assessed on their oral reading performance when reading a complex text. Along with reading speed, we measured not only the number and quality of reading errors but also the extent and semantic nature of the self-corrections during reading. The reading comprehension was measured through aided text retellings. The results showed that, as a group, the dyslexics performed poorer on most measures, but there were notable within-group differences in the reading behaviours and little association between how well university students with Dyslexia_HP read aloud and comprehended the text. These findings suggest that many dyslexics in higher education tend to focus their attention on one subcomponent of the reading process, for example, decoding or comprehension, because engaging in both simultaneously may be too demanding for them.

The impact of Central_HP sparing on the word-length effect in Hemianopia_HP.Studies suggest that a word-length effect of up to 160 ms/letter distinguishes hemianopic Dyslexia_HP from pure Alexia_HP. However, partial preservation of Central_HP vision is common in Right_HP Hemianopia_HP, but its effects on single-word reading are unknown. Eighteen Healthy_HP subjects read single words with a gaze-contingent Right_HP Hemianopia_HP simulation that varied the degree of Central_HP sparing. Mean reading Onset_HP time declined with small degrees of Central_HP sparing, but the word-length effect did not decrease until sparing exceeded 3.15°. We next evaluated the effects of font size. Effects of Central_HP sparing were constant when expressed in number of letters, with a decline in word-length effect beginning as sparing approached 4 letters. We conclude that the effects of Central_HP sparing on mean reading Onset_HP time and the word-length effect are distinct. We provide diagnostic word-length criteria for discriminating between pure Alexia_HP and hemianopic Dyslexia_HP with various degrees of Central_HP sparing.

Genetic polymorphism of nonsyndromic Cleft_lip_HP with or without Cleft_palate_HP is associated with developmental Dyslexia_HP in Chinese school-aged populations.Developmental Dyslexia_HP (DD) is a neurodevelopment disorder characterized by reading disabilities without apparent etiologies. Nonsyndromic Cleft_lip_HP with or without Cleft_palate_HP (NSCL/P) is a structural craniofacial malformation featured by isolated orofacial abnormalities. Despite substantial phenotypic differences, potential linkage between these two disorders has been suggested as prevalence of DD among NSCL/P patients was much higher than that in general populations. Previous neuroimaging studies observed impaired short-term memory in patients with DD and NSCL/P, respectively. Genetic factors have a fundamental role during neurodevelopment and craniofacial morphogenesis but there lacks of evidence to support the linkage between DD and NSCL/P at genetic level. A recent genome-wide association study in Chinese populations identified a number of genetic polymorphisms associated with NSCL/P. Herein, we selected three risk variants of NSCL/P namely rs8049367, rs4791774 and rs2235371, and performed association analysis with DD in a Chinese population consisting 631 elementary school-aged children with 288 dyslexic cases without NSCL/P and 343 Healthy_HP controls. After Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, the T allele of rs8049367 showed significant association with DD (OR=1.41, P=0.0085). It is an intergenic variant between CREBBP and ADCY9 located at 16p13.3. The CREBBP gene was reported to have an essential role during memory formation, although ADCY9 was involved in dental development. In future studies, understanding functional effects of rs8049367 on CERBBP and ADCY9 might contribute to explain underlying etiologies shared by DD and NSCL/P.

Phonemic-Morphemic dissociation in university students with Dyslexia_HP: an index of reading compensation?A phonological deficit constitutes a primary cause of developmental Dyslexia_HP, which persists into adulthood and can explain some aspects of their reading impairment. Nevertheless, some dyslexic adults successfully manage to study at university level, although very little is currently known about how they achieve this. The present study investigated at both the individual and group levels, whether the development of another oral language skill, namely, morphological knowledge, can be preserved and dissociated from the development of phonological knowledge. Reading, phonological, and morphological abilities were measured in 20 dyslexic and 20 non-dyslexic university students. The results confirmed the persistence of deficits in phonological but not morphological abilities, thereby revealing a dissociation in the development of these two skills. Moreover, the magnitude of the dissociation correlated with reading level. The outcome supports the claim that university students with Dyslexia_HP may compensate for phonological weaknesses by drawing on morphological knowledge in reading.

The Effects of Visual Attention Span and Phonological Decoding in Reading Comprehension in Dyslexia_HP: A Path Analysis.Increasing evidence has shown visual attention span to be a factor, distinct from phonological skills, that explains single-word identification (pseudo-word/word reading) performance in Dyslexia_HP. Yet, little is known about how well visual attention span explains text comprehension. Observing reading comprehension in a sample of 105 high school students with Dyslexia_HP, we used a pathway analysis to examine the direct and indirect path between visual attention span and reading comprehension while controlling for other factors such as phonological awareness, letter identification, short-term memory, IQ and age. Integrating phonemic decoding efficiency skills in the analytic model, this study aimed to disentangle how visual attention span and phonological skills work together in reading comprehension for readers with Dyslexia_HP. We found visual attention span to have a significant direct effect on more difficult reading comprehension but not on an easier level. It also had a significant direct effect on pseudo-word identification but not on word identification. In addition, we found that visual attention span indirectly explains reading comprehension through pseudo-word reading and word reading skills. This study supports the hypothesis that at least part of the dyslexic profile can be explained by visual attention abilities. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Neural initialization of audiovisual integration in prereaders at varying risk for developmental Dyslexia_HP.Learning letter-speech sound correspondences is a major step in reading acquisition and is severely impaired in children with Dyslexia_HP. Up to now, it remains largely unknown how quickly neural networks adopt specific functions during audiovisual integration of linguistic information when prereading children learn letter-speech sound correspondences. Here, we simulated the process of learning letter-speech sound correspondences in 20 prereading children (6.13-7.17 years) at varying risk for Dyslexia_HP by training artificial letter-speech sound correspondences within a single experimental session. Subsequently, we acquired simultaneously event-related potentials (ERP) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans during implicit audiovisual presentation of trained and untrained pairs. Audiovisual integration of trained pairs correlated with individual learning rates in Right_HP superior temporal, Left_HP inferior temporal, and Bilateral_HP parietal areas and with phonological awareness in Left_HP temporal areas. In correspondence, a differential Left_HP-lateralized parietooccipitotemporal ERP at 400 ms for trained pairs correlated with learning achievement and familial risk. Finally, a late (650 ms) posterior negativity indicating audiovisual congruency of trained pairs was associated with increased fMRI activation in the Left_HP occipital cortex. Taken together, a short (<30 min) letter-speech sound training initializes audiovisual integration in neural systems that are responsible for processing linguistic information in proficient readers. To conclude, the ability to learn grapheme-phoneme correspondences, the familial history of Dyslexia_HP, and phonological awareness of prereading children account for the degree of audiovisual integration in a distributed brain network. Such findings on emerging linguistic audiovisual integration could allow for distinguishing between children with typical and atypical reading development.

Genetic Etiologies of Comorbidity and Stability for Reading Difficulties and ADHD: A Replication Study.Because of recent concerns about the replication of published results in the behavioral and biomedical sciences (Ioannidis, PLoS Medicine, Vol. 2, 2005, p. e124; Open Science Collaboration, Science, Vol. 349, 2015, p. 943; Pashler & Wagenmakers, Perspectives on Psychological Science, Vol. 7, 2012, pp. 528-530), we have conducted a replication of our recently published analyses of longitudinal reading performance and Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_HP data from twin pairs selected for reading difficulties (Wadsworth et al., Twin Research and Human Genetics, Vol. 18, 2015, pp. 755-761). Results obtained from univariate and bivariate (DeFries & Fulker, Behavior Genetics, Vol. 15, 1985, pp. 467-473; Acta Geneticae Medicae et Gemellologiae: Twin Research, Vol. 37, 1988, pp. 205-216) analyses of data from a subset of twin pairs tested in the International Longitudinal Twin Study of Early Reading Development at post-4th grade, and its continuation into high school at post-9th grade, were compared to those from our previous report. Similar measures of reading performance, the same measures of inattention and Hyperactivity_HP/Impulsivity_HP, and similar selection criteria were used in the two studies. In general, the patterns of results obtained from these two independent studies were highly similar. Thus, these results clearly illustrate the principle that findings from studies in quantitative behavioral genetics often replicate (Plomin et al., Perspectives on Psychological Science, Vol. 11, 2016, pp. 3-23).

The Nature of Verbal Short-Term Impairment in Dyslexia_HP: The Importance of Serial Order.Verbal short-term memory (STM) impairment is one of the most consistent associated deficits observed in developmental reading disorders such as Dyslexia_HP. Few studies have addressed the nature of this STM impairment, especially as regards the ability to temporarily store serial order information. This question is important as studies in typically developing children have shown that serial order STM abilities are predictors of oral and written Language_Development_ASDPTO. Associated serial order STM deficits in Dyslexia_HP may therefore further increase the learning difficulties in these populations. In this mini review, we show that specific serial order STM impairment is frequently reported in both dyslexic children and adults with a history of Dyslexia_HP. Serial order STM impairment appears to occur for the retention of both verbal and visuo-spatial sequence information. Serial order STM impairment is, however, not a characteristic of every individual dyslexic subject and is not specific to Dyslexia_HP. Future studies need to determine whether serial order STM impairment is a risk factor which, in association with phonological processing deficits, can lead to Dyslexia_HP or whether serial order STM impairment reflects associated deficits causally unrelated to Dyslexia_HP.

Prosodic Similarity Effects in Short-Term Memory in Developmental Dyslexia_HP.Children with developmental Dyslexia_HP are characterized by phonological difficulties across languages. Classically, this 'phonological deficit' in Dyslexia_HP has been investigated with tasks using single-syllable words. Recently, however, several studies have demonstrated difficulties in prosodic awareness in Dyslexia_HP. Potential prosodic effects in short-term memory have not yet been investigated. Here we create a new instrument based on three-syllable words that vary in stress patterns, to investigate whether prosodic similarity (the same prosodic pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables) exerts systematic effects on short-term memory. We study participants with Dyslexia_HP and age-matched and younger reading-level-matched typically developing controls. We find that all participants, including dyslexic participants, show prosodic similarity effects in short-term memory. All participants exhibited better retention of words that differed in prosodic structure, although participants with Dyslexia_HP recalled fewer words accurately overall compared to age-matched controls. Individual differences in prosodic memory were predicted by earlier vocabulary abilities, by earlier sensitivity to syllable stress and by earlier phonological awareness. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of prosodic similarity effects in short-term memory. The implications of a prosodic similarity effect for theories of lexical representation and of Dyslexia_HP are discussed. © 2016 The Authors. Dyslexia_HP published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.
Prosodic Similarity Effects in Short-Term Memory in Developmental Dyslexia_HP.Children with developmental dyslexia are characterized by phonological difficulties across languages. Classically, this 'phonological deficit' in dyslexia has been investigated with tasks using single-syllable words. Recently, however, several studies have demonstrated difficulties in prosodic awareness in dyslexia. Potential prosodic effects in short-term memory have not yet been investigated. Here we create a new instrument based on three-syllable words that vary in stress patterns, to investigate whether prosodic similarity (the same prosodic pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables) exerts systematic effects on short-term memory. We study participants with dyslexia and age-matched and younger reading-level-matched typically developing controls. We find that all participants, including dyslexic participants, show prosodic similarity effects in short-term memory.

Performance of children with developmental Dyslexia_HP on high and low topological entropy artificial grammar learning task.Graph complexity as measured by topological entropy has been previously shown to Affect_ASDPTO performance on artificial grammar learning tasks among typically developing children. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of graph complexity on implicit sequential learning among children with developmental Dyslexia_HP. Our goal was to determine whether children's performance depends on the complexity level of the grammar system learned. We conducted two artificial grammar learning experiments that compared performance of children with developmental Dyslexia_HP with that of age- and reading level-matched controls. Experiment 1 was a high topological entropy artificial grammar learning task that aimed to establish implicit learning phenomena in children with developmental Dyslexia_HP using previously published experimental conditions. Experiment 2 is a lower topological entropy variant of that task. Results indicated that given a high topological entropy grammar system, children with developmental Dyslexia_HP who were similar to the reading age-matched control group had substantial difficulty in performing the task as compared to typically developing children, who exhibited intact implicit learning of the grammar. On the other hand, when tested on a lower topological entropy grammar system, all groups performed above chance level, indicating that children with developmental Dyslexia_HP were able to identify rules from a given grammar system. The results reinforced the significance of graph complexity when experimenting with artificial grammar learning tasks, particularly with dyslexic participants.

P300 event-related potentials in children with Dyslexia_HP.To elucidate the timing and the nature of neural disturbances in Dyslexia_HP and to further understand the topographical distribution of these, we examined entire brain regions employing the non-invasive auditory oddball P300 paradigm in children with Dyslexia_HP and neurotypical controls. Our findings revealed abnormalities for the Dyslexia_HP group in (i) P300 latency, globally, but greatest in frontal brain regions and (ii) decreased P300 amplitude confined to the Central_HP brain regions (Fig. 1). These findings reflect abnormalities associated with a diminished capacity to process mental workload as well as delayed processing of this information in children with Dyslexia_HP. Furthermore, the topographical distribution of these findings suggests a distinct spatial distribution for the observed P300 abnormalities. This information may be useful in future therapeutic or brain stimulation intervention trials.

Statistical learning and Dyslexia_HP: a systematic review.The existing literature on developmental Dyslexia_HP (hereafter: Dyslexia_HP) often focuses on isolating cognitive skills which differ across dyslexic and control participants. Among potential correlates, previous research has studied group differences between dyslexic and control participants in performance on statistical learning tasks. A statistical learning deficit has been proposed to be a potential cause and/or a marker effect for early detection of Dyslexia_HP. It is therefore of practical importance to evaluate the evidence for a group difference. From a theoretical perspective, such a group difference would provide information about the causal chain from statistical learning to reading acquisition. We provide a systematic review of the literature on such a group difference. We conclude that there is insufficient high-quality data to draw conclusions about the presence or absence of an effect.

The influences and outcomes of phonological awareness: a study of MA, PA and auditory processing in pre-readers with a family risk of Dyslexia_HP.The direct influence of phonological awareness (PA) on reading outcomes has been widely demonstrated, yet PA may also exert indirect influence on reading outcomes through other cognitive variables such as morphological awareness (MA). However, PA's own development is dependent and influenced by many extraneous variables such as auditory processing, which could ultimately impact reading outcomes. In a group of pre-reading children with a family risk of Dyslexia_HP and low-risk controls, this study sets out to answer questions surrounding PA's relationship at various grain sizes (syllable, Onset_HP/rime and phoneme) with measures of auditory processing (Frequency_HP modulation (FM) and an amplitude rise-time task (RT)) and MA, independent of reading experience. Group analysis revealed significant differences between high- and low-risk children on measures of MA, and PA at all grain sizes, while a trend for lower RT thresholds of high-risk children was found compared with controls. Correlational analysis demonstrated that MA is related to the composite PA score and syllable awareness. Group differences on MA and PA were re-examined including PA and MA, respectively, as control variables. Results exposed PA as a relevant component of MA, independent of reading experience.

How Should Medical Schools Respond to Students with Dyslexia_HP?We examine the dilemmas faced by a medical student with Dyslexia_HP who wonders whether he should "out" himself to faculty to receive the accommodations entitled by federal law. We first discuss scientific evidence on Dyslexia_HP's prevalence, unexpected nature, and neurobiology. We then examine the experiences of medical students who have revealed their Dyslexia_HP to illustrate the point that, far too often, attending physicians who know little about Dyslexia_HP can misperceive the motives or behavior of students with Dyslexia_HP. Because ignorance and misperception of Dyslexia_HP can result in bias against students with Dyslexia_HP, we strongly recommend a mandatory course for faculty that provides a basic scientific and clinical overview of Dyslexia_HP to facilitate greater understanding of Dyslexia_HP and support for students with Dyslexia_HP.

Dyslexic Children Show Atypical Cerebellar Activation and Cerebro-Cerebellar Functional Connectivity in Orthographic and Phonological Processing.Previous neuroimaging studies have found atypical cerebellar activation in individuals with Dyslexia_HP in either motor-related tasks or language tasks. However, studies investigating atypical cerebellar activation in individuals with Dyslexia_HP have mostly used tasks tapping phonological processing. A question that is yet unanswered is whether the cerebellum in individuals with Dyslexia_HP functions properly during orthographic processing of words, as growing evidence shows that the cerebellum is also involved in visual and spatial processing. Here, we investigated cerebellar activation and cerebro-cerebellar functional connectivity during word processing in dyslexic readers and typically developing readers using tasks that tap orthographic and phonological codes. In children with Dyslexia_HP, we observed an abnormally higher engagement of the Bilateral_HP cerebellum for the orthographic task, which was negatively correlated with literacy measures. The greater the reading impairment was for young dyslexic readers, the stronger the cerebellar activation was. This suggests a compensatory role of the cerebellum in reading for children with Dyslexia_HP. In addition, a tendency for higher cerebellar activation in dyslexic readers was found in the phonological task. Moreover, the functional connectivity was stronger for dyslexic readers relative to typically developing readers between the lobule VI of the Right_HP cerebellum and the Left_HP fusiform gyrus during the orthographic task and between the lobule VI of the Left_HP cerebellum and the Left_HP supramarginal gyrus during the phonological task. This pattern of results suggests that the cerebellum compensates for reading impairment through the connections with specific brain regions responsible for the ongoing reading task. These findings enhance our understanding of the cerebellum's involvement in reading and reading impairment.

Descriptive epidemiology of prenatal and perinatal risk factors in a Chinese population with reading disorder.Several prenatal and perinatal factors have been found to be associated with developmental Dyslexia_HP (reading disorder) in alphabetic language. Given the absence of relevant studies of Chinese children, the present study tries to investigate these risk factors. A total of 45,850 students were recruited from grades three to six, from seven cities of Hubei province. Dyslexia_HP in Chinese was diagnosed based on children's clinical symptoms. The clinical symptoms of children's reading performance were assessed by Dyslexia_HP Checklist for Chinese Children (DCCC) and Pupil Rating Scale Revised Screening for Learning Disabilities (PRS) which were completed by parent/guardian and header teacher respectively. Chinese language exam was used to screen children with poor reading capacity. Questionnaires about prenatal and perinatal factors were completed by parent or guardian. Among the 34,748 eligible participants, 1,200 (3.45%) were diagnosed with Dyslexia_HP in Chinese. More boys suffered from Dyslexia_HP than the girls and the gender ratio was 3:1. Family_history_HP of neuropsychiatric diseases, maternal infectious diseases, difficult vaginal delivery, preterm birth, and Neonatal_asphyxia_HP were found to increase the risk of developmental Dyslexia_HP in China. Closer longitudinal developmental monitoring and preventive measures should be taken for high risk children.

Behavioral and Molecular Genetics of Reading-Related AM and FM Detection Thresholds.Auditory detection thresholds for certain frequencies of both amplitude modulated (AM) and Frequency_HP modulated (FM) dynamic auditory stimuli are associated with reading in typically developing and dyslexic readers. We present the first behavioral and molecular genetic characterization of these two auditory traits. Two extant extended family datasets were given reading tasks and psychoacoustic tasks to determine FM 2 Hz and AM 20 Hz sensitivity thresholds. Univariate heritabilities were significant for both AM (h

Atypical neural synchronization to speech envelope modulations in Dyslexia_HP.A fundamental deficit in the synchronization of neural oscillations to temporal information in speech could underlie phonological processing problems in Dyslexia_HP. In this study, the hypothesis of a neural synchronization impairment is investigated more specifically as a function of different neural oscillatory bands and temporal information rates in speech. Auditory steady-state responses to 4, 10, 20 and 40Hz modulations were recorded in normal reading and dyslexic adolescents to measure neural synchronization of theta, alpha, beta and low-gamma oscillations to syllabic and phonemic rate information. In comparison to normal readers, dyslexic readers showed reduced non-synchronized theta activity, reduced synchronized alpha activity and enhanced synchronized beta activity. Positive correlations between alpha synchronization and phonological skills were found in normal readers, but were absent in dyslexic readers. In contrast, dyslexic readers exhibited positive correlations between beta synchronization and phonological skills. Together, these results suggest that auditory neural synchronization of alpha and beta oscillations is atypical in Dyslexia_HP, indicating deviant neural processing of both syllabic and phonemic rate information. Impaired synchronization of alpha oscillations in particular demonstrated to be the most prominent neural anomaly possibly hampering speech and phonological processing in dyslexic readers.

Distinct differences in striatal dysmorphology between Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_HP boys with and without a comorbid Dyslexia_HP.There is evidence of greater Cognitive_impairment_HP in Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_HP with a comorbid Dyslexia_HP (ADHD/+RD) compared to ADHD alone (ADHD/-RD). Additionally, the striatum has been consistently implicated in ADHD. However, the extent of morphological alterations in the striatum of ADHD/+RD is poorly understood, which is the main purpose of this study. Based on structural MRI images, the surface deformation of the caudate and putamen was assessed in 59 boys matching in age and IQ [19 ADHD/-RD, 15 ADHD/+RD and 25 typically developing controls (TDC)]. A vertex based analysis with multiple comparison correction was conducted to compare ADHD/-RD and ADHD/+RD to TDC. Compared to TDC, ADHD/+RD showed multiple Bilateral_HP significant clusters of surface compression. In contrast, ADHD/-RD showed fewer significant clusters of surface compression and restricted to the Left_HP side. Regarding the putamen, only ADHD/-RD showed significant clusters of surface compression. Results demonstrate for the first time a greater extent of morphological alterations in the caudate of ADHD/+RD than ADHD/-RD compared to TDC, which may suggest greater implicated cortical areas projecting to the caudate that are associated with the greater neuropsychological impairments observed in ADHD/+RD.

Contra-Lateral_HP Auditory Brainstem Responses in Dyslexia_HP.Developmental care comprises a wide range of medical and nursing interventions used in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to mitigate and reduce stressors affecting preterm or ill neonates. Because patient satisfaction survey is a valuable quality improvement tool, we aimed to develop and test the psychometric properties of a tool for measuring parent satisfaction of developmental care in the NICU.

The roles of cognitive and language abilities in predicting decoding and reading comprehension: comparisons of Dyslexia_HP and specific Language_impairment_HP.This study aimed to (a) explore the roles of cognitive and language variables in predicting reading abilities of two groups of individuals with reading disabilities (i.e., Dyslexia_HP and specific Language_impairment_HP) and (b) examine which variable(s) is the most predictive in differentiating two groups. Inclusion/exclusion criteria applied to categorize the two groups yielded a total of 63 participants (n = 44 for the Dyslexia_HP; n = 19 for the specific Language_impairment_HP). A stepwise multiple regression approach was conducted to examine which cognitive and/or language variables made the largest contribution to reading abilities (i.e., Phonetic Decoding Efficiency, Word Attack, Sight Word Efficiency, and Passage Comprehension). Results revealed that there were significant differences in which measures of cognitive and Language_Ability_ASDPTO predicted individuals with Dyslexia_HP and speech and Language_impairment_HP reading ability, showing that the cognitive and language variables underlying their difficulty with reading abilities were not the same across the two groups. A discriminant function analysis showed that a measure of Verbal Comprehension, Phonological Awareness, and Phonetic Decoding Efficiency can be used to differentiate the two groups. These findings support the tenet that Dyslexia_HP and specific Language_impairment_HP are two subgroups of reading disabilities and that thorough diagnostic evaluations are needed to differentiate between these two subgroups. Distinctions of this nature are Central_HP to determining the type and Severity_HP of language-based interventions.

A sequence learning impairment in Dyslexia_HP? It depends on the task.Language acquisition is argued to be dependent upon an individuals' sensitivity to serial-order regularities in the environment (sequential learning), and impairments in reading and spelling in Dyslexia_HP have recently been attributed to a deficit in sequential learning. The present study examined the learning and consolidation of sequential knowledge in 30 adults with Dyslexia_HP and 29 typical adults matched on age and Absent_speech_HP ability using two tasks previously reported to be sensitive to a sequence learning deficit. Both groups showed evidence of sequential learning and consolidation on a serial response time (SRT) task (i.e., faster and more accurate responses to sequenced spatial locations than randomly ordered spatial locations during training that persisted one week later). Whilst typical adults showed evidence of sequential learning on a Hebb repetition task (i.e., more accurate serial recall of repetitive sequences of nonwords versus randomly ordered sequences), adults with Dyslexia_HP showed initial advantages for repetitive versus randomly ordered sequences in the first half of training trials, but this effect disappeared in the second half of trials. This Hebb repetition effect was positively correlated with spelling in the dyslexic group; however, there was no correlation between sequential learning on the two tasks, placing doubt over whether sequential learning in different modalities represents a single capacity. These data suggest that sequential learning difficulties in adults with Dyslexia_HP are not ubiquitous, and when present may be a consequence of task demands rather than sequence learning per se.

Low self-concept in poor readers: prevalence, Heterogeneous_HP, and risk.There is evidence that poor readers are at increased risk for various types of low self-concept-particularly academic self-concept. However, this evidence ignores the Heterogeneous_HP nature of poor readers, and hence the likelihood that not all poor readers have low self-concept. The aim of this study was to better understand

Neural signatures of phonological deficits in Chinese developmental Dyslexia_HP.There has been debate on whether phonological deficits explain reading difficulty in Chinese, since Chinese is a logographic language which does not employ grapheme-phoneme-correspondence rules and remote memorization seems to be the main method to acquire reading. In the current study, we present neuroimaging evidence that the phonological deficit is also a signature of Chinese Dyslexia_HP. Specifically, we found that Chinese children with Dyslexia_HP (DD) showed reduced brain activation in the Left_HP dorsal inferior frontal gyrus (dIFG) when compared to both age-matched controls (AC) and reading-matched controls (RC) during an auditory rhyming judgment task. This suggests that the phonological processing deficit in this region may be a signature of Dyslexia_HP in Chinese, rather than a difference due to Task_Performance_ASDPTO or reading ability, which was matched on DD and RC. At exactly the same region of the Left_HP dIFG, we found a positive correlation between brain activation and reading skill in DD, suggesting that the phonological deficit is associated with the Severity_HP of Dyslexia_HP. We also found increased brain activation in the Right_HP precentral gyrus in DD than both AC and RC, suggesting a compensation of reliance on articulation. Functional connectivity analyses revealed that DD had a weaker connection between the Left_HP superior temporal gyrus (STG) and fusiform gyrus (FG) than the two control groups, suggesting that the reduced connection between phonology and orthography is another neural signature of Dyslexia_HP. In contrast, DD showed greater connectivity between the Left_HP dIFG and the Left_HP inferior parietal lobule (IPL) than both control groups, suggesting a reduced segregation between the language network and default mode network in dyslexic children. We also found that connectivity between the Left_HP STG and the Left_HP dIFG was sensitive to Task_Performance_ASDPTO and/or reading skill rather than being dyslexic or not, because AC was greater than both RC and DD, while the connectivity between the Left_HP middle occipital gyrus (MOG) and Left_HP STG was sensitive to age, because both AC and DD were greater than RC. In summary, our study provides the very first neurological evidence of phonological deficits in Chinese developmental Dyslexia_HP and we successfully distinguished variations of brain activity/functional connectivity due to age, performance, and Dyslexia_HP by comparing AC, RC, and DD.

A Review about Functional Illiteracy: Definition, Cognitive, Linguistic, and Numerical Aspects.Formally, availability of education for children has increased around the world over the last decades. However, despite having a successful formal education career, adults can become functional illiterates. Functional illiteracy means that a person cannot use reading, writing, and calculation skills for his/her own and the community's development. Functional illiteracy has considerable negative effects not only on personal development, but also in economic and social terms. Although functional illiteracy has been highly publicized in mass media in the recent years, there is limited scientific knowledge about the people termed functional illiterates; definition, assessment, and differential diagnoses with respect to related numerical and linguistic impairments are rarely studied and controversial. The first goal of our review is to give a comprehensive overview of the research on functional illiteracy by describing gaps in knowledge within the field and to outline and address the basic questions concerning who can be considered as functional illiterates: (1) Do they possess basic skills? (2) In which abilities do they have the largest deficits? (3) Are numerical and linguistic deficits related? (4) What is the fundamental reason for their difficulties? (5) Are there main differences between functional illiterates, illiterates, and dyslexics? We will see that despite partial evidence, there is still much research needed to answer these questions. Secondly, we emphasize the timeliness for a new and more precise definition that results in uniform sampling, better Diagnosis_ASDPTO, conclusion, and intervention. We propose the following working definition as the result of the review: functional illiteracy is the incapability to understand complex texts despite adequate schooling, age, language skills, elementary reading skills, and IQ. These inabilities must also not be fully explained by sensory, domain-general cognitive, neurological or Mental_Disorders_ASDPTO. In sum, we suggest that functional illiteracy must be more thoroughly understood and assessed from a theoretical, empirical, and diagnostic perspective.

The Effect of Illustration on Improving Text Comprehension in Dyslexic Adults.This study analyses the effect of pictures in reading materials on the viewing patterns of dyslexic adults. By analysing viewing patterns using eye-tracking, we captured differences in eye movements between young adults with Dyslexia_HP and controls based on the influence of reading skill as a continuous variable of the total sample. Both types of participants were assigned randomly to view either text-only or a text + picture stimuli. The results show that the controls made an early global overview of the material and (when a picture was present) rapid transitions between text and picture. Having text illustrated with a picture decreased scores on questions about the learning material among participants with Dyslexia_HP. Controls spent 1.7% and dyslexic participants 1% of their time on the picture. Controls had 24% fewer total fixations; however, 29% more of the control group's fixations than the dyslexic group's fixations were on the picture. We also looked for effects of different types of pictures. Dyslexic subjects exhibited a comparable viewing pattern to controls when scenes were complex, but fewer fixations when scenes were neutral/simple. Individual scan paths are presented as examples of atypical viewing patterns for individuals with Dyslexia_HP as compared with controls. © 2016 The Authors.

University Students with Dyslexia_HP: A Qualitative Exploratory Study of Learning Practices, Challenges and Strategies.People with Dyslexia_HP are vastly under-represented in universities (Katusic et al., , Richardson & Wydell, ; Stampoltzis & Polychronopoulou, ). This situation is of concern for modern societies that value social justice. This study was designed to explore learning experiences of university students with Dyslexia_HP and factors that could contribute to their success. Thirteen students with Dyslexia_HP and 20 non-dyslexic peers were interviewed about their university learning experiences using a semi-structured qualitative approach. Students with Dyslexia_HP described engaging in learning activities intensively, frequently and strategically. They reported challenges and strengths relating to study skills, lectures, assessments, technology and support services. They also described helpful strategies including self-directed adaptive techniques, provisions from lecturers and assistance from the university. These findings suggest that students with Dyslexia_HP experience broad challenges at university, but helpful strategies may be available. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Combined Modality Intervention for ADHD With Comorbid Reading Disorders: A Proof of Concept Study.To evaluate the relative efficacy of two reading programs with and without adjunctive stimulant medication for children with attention-deficit/Hyperactivity_HP disorder and comorbid reading disorder (ADHD+RD). Sixty-five children (7-11 years in age) were assigned randomly to one of three intensive remedial academic programs (phonologically or strategy-based reading instruction, or general academic strategy and social skills training) in combination with either immediate-release methylphenidate or placebo. Multiple-blind procedures were used for medication/placebo, given twice daily. Children received 35 hours of instruction in 10 weeks, taught by a trained teacher in a separate school classroom, in small matched groups of 2 to 3. Children's behavior and reading abilities were assessed before and after intervention. Stimulant medication produced expected beneficial effects on hyperactive/Impulsivity_HP Behavioral_abnormality_HP (reported by classroom teachers) but none on reading. Children receiving a reading program showed greater gains than controls on multiple standardized measures of reading and related skills (regardless of medication status). Small sample sizes precluded interpretation of possible potentiating effects of stimulant medication on reading skills taught in particular reading programs. Intensive reading instruction, regardless of treatment with stimulant medication, may be efficacious in improving reading problems in children with ADHD+RD and warrants further investigation in a large-scale study.

Beyond Phonology: Visual Processes Predict Alphanumeric and Nonalphanumeric Rapid Naming in Poor Early Readers.Visual processes in Grade 1 were examined for their predictive influences in nonalphanumeric and alphanumeric rapid naming (RAN) in 51 poor early and 69 typical readers. In a lagged design, children were followed longitudinally from Grade 1 to Grade 3 over 5 testing occasions. RAN outcomes in early Grade 2 were predicted by speeded and nonspeeded visual processing measures, after controlling for initial (Grade 1) RAN, matrix Reasoning_ASDPTO, phonological awareness, and word decoding abilities. A predictive influence of backward visual masking-a speeded visual discrimination task-was found for nonalphanumeric RAN in early Grade 2 but not for alphanumeric RAN or subsequent RAN ability in Grades 2 and 3. A nonspeeded predictor involving controlled visual attention accounted for significant variance in early Grade 2 RAN in the poor early reader group. Results are discussed in relation to Wolf, Bowers, and Biddle's conceptualization of rapid naming-in particular, on the roles of visual processes in speeded low and nonspeeded high spatial Frequency_HP visual information in predicting RAN.

Altered patterns of directed connectivity within the reading network of dyslexic children and their relation to reading dysfluency.Reading is a complex cognitive skill subserved by a distributed network of visual and language-related regions. Disruptions of connectivity within this network have been associated with developmental Dyslexia_HP but their relation to individual differences in the Severity_HP of reading problems remains unclear. Here we investigate whether dysfunctional connectivity scales with the level of reading dysfluency by examining EEG recordings during visual word and false font processing in 9-year-old typically reading children (TR) and two groups of dyslexic children: severely dysfluent (SDD) and moderately dysfluent (MDD) dyslexics. Results indicated weaker occipital to inferior-temporal connectivity for words in both dyslexic groups relative to TRs. Furthermore, SDDs exhibited stronger connectivity from Left_HP Central_HP to Right_HP inferior-temporal and occipital sites for words relative to TRs, and for false fonts relative to both MDDs and TRs. Importantly, reading fluency was positively related with forward and negatively with backward connectivity. Our results suggest disrupted visual processing of words in both dyslexic groups, together with a compensatory recruitment of Right_HP posterior brain regions especially in the SDDs during word and false font processing. Functional connectivity in the brain's reading network may thus depend on the level of reading dysfluency beyond group differences between dyslexic and typical readers.

Late-diagnosed phenylketonuria in an eight-year-old boy with Dyslexia_HP and attention-deficit Hyperactivity_HP disorder.Phenylketonuria, previously a common cause of Severe_HP Intellectual_disability_HP, is a metabolic disorder now promptly diagnosed and effectively treated thanks to newborn screening programs. Here, we report a male patient presenting with Dyslexia_HP and attention-deficit Hyperactivity_HP disorder, who was diagnosed with Mild_HP phenylketonuria at eight years of age. Earlier recognition and treatment before the establishment of irreversible brain damage would have resulted in better neurobehavioural outcomes. Classical phenylketonuria and Mild_HPer phenotypes of Reduced_phenylalanine_hydroxylase_activity_HP need to be considered in the differential Diagnosis_ASDPTO of all cognitive and behavioural problems of unknown cause.

Screening for Dyslexia_HP Using Eye Tracking during Reading.Dyslexia_HP is a neurodevelopmental Dyslexia_HP estimated to Affect_ASDPTO 5-10% of the population. While there is yet no full understanding of the cause of Dyslexia_HP, or agreement on its precise definition, it is certain that many individuals suffer persistent problems in learning to read for no apparent reason. Although it is generally agreed that early intervention is the best form of support for children with Dyslexia_HP, there is still a lack of efficient and objective means to help identify those at risk during the early years of school. Here we show that it is possible to identify 9-10 year old individuals at risk of persistent reading difficulties by using eye tracking during reading to probe the processes that underlie reading ability. In contrast to current screening methods, which rely on oral or written tests, eye tracking does not depend on the subject to produce some overt verbal response and thus provides a natural means to objectively assess the reading process as it unfolds in real-time. Our study is based on a sample of 97 high-risk subjects with early identified word decoding difficulties and a control group of 88 low-risk subjects. These subjects were selected from a larger population of 2165 school children attending second grade. Using predictive modeling and statistical resampling techniques, we develop classification models from eye tracking records less than one minute in duration and show that the models are able to differentiate high-risk subjects from low-risk subjects with high accuracy. Although Dyslexia_HP is fundamentally a language-based learning disability, our results suggest that eye movements in reading can be highly predictive of individual reading ability and that eye tracking can be an efficient means to identify children at risk of long-term reading difficulties.

Temporal Processing Development in Chinese Primary School-Aged Children With Dyslexia_HP.This study aimed to investigate the development of visual and auditory temporal processing among children with and without Dyslexia_HP and to examine the roles of temporal processing in reading and reading-related abilities. A total of 362 Chinese children in Grades 1-6 were recruited from Taiwan. Half of the children had Dyslexia_HP, and the other half were typically developing children who matched the dyslexic group on age, intelligence, and gender. Our results indicate that for typically developing children, the visual and auditory modalities follow the same developmental trend: The children in first and second grades performed significantly worse than the older children. Among the children with Dyslexia_HP, however, significant improvements in the visual modality were observed with increasing age. Furthermore, although both modalities were important for all reading-related abilities and for Chinese character reading in first and second grades, the visual modality significantly predicted only orthographic knowledge and Chinese character reading in third and fourth grades. In contrast, the auditory modality Affected_HP only phonological awareness. In fifth and sixth grades, only visual temporal processing slightly contributed to the orthographic knowledge and Chinese character reading of the dyslexic group. Also, the relationship between temporal processing and Chinese character reading is strongly influenced by age.

The Role of Categorical Speech Perception and Phonological Processing in Familial Risk Children With and Without Dyslexia_HP.This study assessed whether a categorical speech perception (CP) deficit is associated with Dyslexia_HP or familial risk for Dyslexia_HP, by exploring a possible cascading relation from speech perception to phonology to reading and by identifying whether speech perception distinguishes familial risk (FR) children with Dyslexia_HP (FRD) from those without Dyslexia_HP (FRND).

Advances in Dyslexia_HP Genetics-New Insights Into the Role of Brain Asymmetries.Dyslexia_HP is a common condition affecting up to 10% school-aged children. There is strong evidence that genetics plays an important role in Dyslexia_HP and is expected to be complex in nature. Few specific susceptibility factors have been identified so far, but their functional characterization has provided novel insights into the biology of Dyslexia_HP. In particular, they point to an unexpected role of candidate genes for Dyslexia_HP in the biology of cilia, cellular organelles required in many processes including the establishment of Left_HP-Right_HP asymmetries early in development. This observation has brought back into the spotlight the old idea of a link between Dyslexia_HP and handedness. Yet much of the genetics contributing to Dyslexia_HP remains unexplained. The lack of biological markers, clear diagnostic criteria, and homogeneous assessment strategies are just some of the factors preventing the collection of the cohorts powered enough for large-scale genetic studies. While the technology and methods to generate and handle large-scale data have reached unprecedented potential, the main challenge remains in establishing universal guidelines to collect suitable phenotype information across independent studies. These difficulties reflect the complex nature of Dyslexia_HP which is highly Heterogeneous_HP and often co-occurs with other neurodevelopmental disorders.

Comprehension and Generation of Metaphoric Language in Children, Adolescents, and Adults with Dyslexia_HP.Difficulties with figurative language comprehension were documented in adult Dyslexia_HP (DYS). In the present research, we investigated the comprehension and generation of metaphors in 37 children, 35 adolescents, and 34 adults with and without DYS. We also tested the contribution of Executive_Function_ASDPTO to metaphor processing. A multiple-choice questionnaire with conventional and novel metaphors was used to assess comprehension; a concept-explanation task was used to test conventional and novel metaphor generation (verbal creativity). The findings indicated differences between the dyslexic children and the control group in conventional metaphor comprehension. However, both groups performed similarly in the novel metaphor comprehension test. Furthermore, although children and adolescents with DYS showed similar performance in metaphor generation as their typically developing peers, adults with DYS generated more metaphors than controls. While scores on tests of verbal knowledge and Mental_Flexibility_ASDPTO contributed to the prediction of conventional metaphor comprehension, scores on non-verbal tests and Mental_Flexibility_ASDPTO contributed to the prediction of novel metaphor generation. Our findings suggest that individuals with DYS are not impaired in novel metaphor comprehension and metaphor generation and that metaphor comprehension and generation utilize different cognitive resources.

Dysfunction of Rapid Neural Adaptation in Dyslexia_HP.Identification of specific neurophysiological dysfunctions resulting in selective reading difficulty (Dyslexia_HP) has remained elusive. In addition to impaired reading development, individuals with Dyslexia_HP frequently exhibit behavioral deficits in perceptual adaptation. Here, we assessed neurophysiological adaptation to stimulus repetition in adults and children with Dyslexia_HP for a wide variety of stimuli, spoken words, written words, visual objects, and faces. For every stimulus type, individuals with Dyslexia_HP exhibited significantly diminished neural adaptation compared to controls in stimulus-specific cortical areas. Better reading skills in adults and children with Dyslexia_HP were associated with greater repetition-induced neural adaptation. These results highlight a dysfunction of rapid neural adaptation as a core neurophysiological difference in Dyslexia_HP that may underlie impaired reading development. Reduced neurophysiological adaptation may relate to prior reports of reduced behavioral adaptation in Dyslexia_HP and may reveal a difference in brain functions that ultimately results in a specific reading impairment.

Phonological abilities in literacy-impaired children: Brain potentials reveal deficient phoneme discrimination, but intact prosodic processing.Intact phonological processing is crucial for successful literacy acquisition. While individuals with difficulties in reading and spelling (i.e., developmental Dyslexia_HP) are known to experience deficient phoneme discrimination (i.e., segmental phonology), findings concerning their prosodic processing (i.e., suprasegmental phonology) are controversial. Because there are no behavior-independent studies on the underlying neural correlates of prosodic processing in Dyslexia_HP, these controversial findings might be explained by different task demands. To provide an objective behavior-independent picture of segmental and suprasegmental phonological processing in impaired literacy acquisition, we investigated event-related brain potentials during passive listening in typically and poor-spelling German school children. For segmental phonology, we analyzed the Mismatch Negativity (MMN) during vowel length discrimination, capturing automatic auditory deviancy detection in repetitive contexts. For suprasegmental phonology, we analyzed the Closure Positive Shift (CPS) that automatically occurs in response to prosodic boundaries. Our results revealed spelling group differences for the MMN, but not for the CPS, indicating deficient segmental, but intact suprasegmental phonological processing in poor spellers. The present findings point towards a differential role of segmental and suprasegmental phonology in literacy disorders and call for interventions that invigorate impaired literacy by utilizing intact Prosody_ASDPTO in addition to training deficient phonemic awareness.

Neurogenetics of developmental Dyslexia_HP: from genes to behavior through brain neuroimaging and cognitive and sensorial mechanisms.Developmental Dyslexia_HP (DD) is a complex neurodevelopmental deficit characterized by impaired reading acquisition, in spite of adequate neurological and sensorial conditions, educational opportunities and normal intelligence. Despite the successful characterization of DD-susceptibility genes, we are far from understanding the molecular etiological pathways underlying the development of reading (dis)ability. By focusing mainly on clinical phenotypes, the molecular genetics approach has yielded mixed results. More optimally reduced measures of functioning, that is, intermediate phenotypes (IPs), represent a target for researching disease-associated genetic variants and for elucidating the underlying mechanisms. Imaging data provide a viable IP for complex neurobehavioral disorders and have been extensively used to investigate both morphological, structural and functional brain abnormalities in DD. Performing joint genetic and neuroimaging studies in humans is an emerging strategy to link DD-candidate genes to the brain structure and function. A limited number of studies has already pursued the imaging-genetics integration in DD. However, the results are still not sufficient to unravel the complexity of the reading circuit due to Heterogeneous_HP study design and data processing. Here, we propose an interdisciplinary, multilevel, imaging-genetic approach to disentangle the pathways from genes to behavior. As the presence of putative functional genetic variants has been provided and as genetic associations with specific cognitive/sensorial mechanisms have been reported, new hypothesis-driven imaging-genetic studies must gain momentum. This approach would lead to the optimization of diagnostic criteria and to the early identification of 'biologically at-risk' children, supporting the definition of adequate and well-timed prevention strategies and the implementation of novel, specific remediation approach.

Formation of Orthographic Representations in Spanish Dyslexic Children: The Role of Syllable Complexity and Frequency_HP.Recent studies have suggested that Spanish children with Dyslexia_HP have difficulty storing orthographic representations of new words. But given that the syllable plays an important role in word recognition in Spanish, it is possible that the formation of orthographic representations is influenced by the characteristics of the syllables that make up the words. The objective of this study was to determine whether syllabic Frequency_HP and syllabic complexity influence orthographic learning in children with Dyslexia_HP. We compared the performance of a group of dyslexic children with that of a group of typical readers on a task that involved reading short and long pseudowords six times; we manipulated the Frequency_HP and complexity of the syllables from which the pseudowords were constructed. The results showed that dyslexic children do not benefit from syllabic simplicity or Frequency_HP when it comes to storing orthographic representations as the length effect in the dyslexic group remained was unchanged after repeated readings, regardless of stimulus characteristics.

The 1-min Screening Test for Reading Problems in College Students: Psychometric Properties of the 1-min TIL.Reading is a Central_HP cognitive domain, but little research has been devoted to standardized tests for adults. We, thus, examined the psychometric properties of the 1-min version of Teste de Idade de Leitura (Reading Age Test; 1-min TIL), the Portuguese version of Lobrot L3 test, in three experiments with college students: typical readers in Experiment 1A and B, dyslexic readers and chronological age controls in Experiment 2. In Experiment 1A, test-retest reliability and convergent validity were evaluated in 185 students. Reliability was >.70, and phonological decoding underpinned 1-min TIL. In Experiment 1B, internal consistency was assessed by presenting two 45-s versions of the test to 19 students, and performance in these versions was significantly associated (r = .78). In Experiment 2, construct validity, criterion validity and clinical utility of 1-min TIL were investigated. A multiple regression analysis corroborated construct validity; both phonological decoding and listening comprehension were reliable predictors of 1-min TIL scores. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristics analyses revealed the high accuracy of this test in distinguishing dyslexic from typical readers. Therefore, the 1-min TIL, which assesses reading comprehension and potential reading difficulties in college students, has the necessary psychometric properties to become a useful screening instrument in neuropsychological assessment and research.

Association analysis of Dyslexia_HP candidate genes in a Dutch longitudinal sample.Dyslexia_HP is a common Specific_learning_disability_HP with a substantive genetic component. Several candidate genes have been proposed to be implicated in Dyslexia_HP susceptibility, such as DYX1C1, ROBO1, KIAA0319, and DCDC2. Associations with variants in these genes have also been reported with a variety of psychometric measures tapping into the underlying processes that might be impaired in dyslexic people. In this study, we first conducted a literature review to select single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Dyslexia_HP candidate genes that had been repeatedly implicated across studies. We then assessed the SNPs for association in the richly phenotyped longitudinal data set from the Dutch Dyslexia_HP Program. We tested for association with several quantitative traits, including word and nonword reading fluency, rapid naming, phoneme deletion, and nonword repetition. In this, we took advantage of the longitudinal nature of the sample to examine if associations were Stable_HP across four educational time-points (from 7 to 12 years). Two SNPs in the KIAA0319 gene were nominally associated with rapid naming, and these associations were Stable_HP across different ages. Genetic association analysis with complex cognitive traits can be enriched through the use of longitudinal information on trait development.

Exploring Text and Icon Graph Interpretation in Students with Dyslexia_HP: An Eye-tracking Study.A growing body of research suggests that individuals with Dyslexia_HP struggle to use graphs efficiently. Given the persistence of orthographic processing deficits in Dyslexia_HP, this study tested whether graph interpretation deficits in Dyslexia_HP are directly related to difficulties processing the orthographic components of graphs (i.e. axes and legend labels). Participants were 80 college students with and without Dyslexia_HP. Response times and eye movements were recorded as students answered comprehension questions about simple data displayed in bar graphs. Axes and legends were labelled either with words (mixed-modality graphs) or icons (orthography-free graphs). Students also answered informationally equivalent questions presented in sentences (orthography-only condition). Response times were slower in the dyslexic group only for processing sentences. However, eye tracking data revealed group differences for processing mixed-modality graphs, whereas no group differences were found for the orthography-free graphs. When processing bar graphs, students with Dyslexia_HP differ from their able reading peers only when graphs contain orthographic features. Implications for processing informational text are discussed. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Contributions of Letter-Speech Sound Learning and Visual Print Tuning to Reading Improvement: Evidence from Brain Potential and Dyslexia_HP Training Studies.We use a neurocognitive perspective to discuss the contribution of learning letter-speech sound (L-SS) associations and visual specialization in the initial phases of reading in dyslexic children. We review findings from associative learning studies on related cognitive skills important for establishing and consolidating L-SS associations. Then we review brain potential studies, including our own, that yielded two markers associated with reading fluency. Here we show that the marker related to visual specialization (N170) predicts word and pseudoword reading fluency in children who received additional practice in the processing of morphological word structure. Conversely, L-SS integration (indexed by mismatch negativity (MMN)) may only remain important when direct orthography to semantic conversion is not possible, such as in pseudoword reading. In addition, the correlation between these two markers supports the notion that multisensory integration facilitates visual specialization. Finally, we review the role of implicit learning and executive functions in audiovisual learning in Dyslexia_HP. Implications for remedial research are discussed and suggestions for future studies are presented.

Visual_Perception_ASDPTO and Reading: New Clues to Patterns of Dysfunction Across Multiple Visual Channels in Developmental Dyslexia_HP.The specificity of visual channel impairment in Dyslexia_HP has been the subject of much controversy. The purpose of this study was to determine if a differential pattern of impairment can be verified between visual channels in children with developmental Dyslexia_HP, and in particular, if the pattern of deficits is more conspicuous in tasks where the magnocellular-dorsal system recruitment prevails. Additionally, we also aimed at investigating the association between Visual_Perception_ASDPTO thresholds and reading.

Auditory Stimulus Processing and Task Learning Are Adequate in Dyslexia_HP, but Benefits From Regularities Are Reduced.The reading deficit for people with Dyslexia_HP is typically associated with linguistic, memory, and perceptual-discrimination difficulties, whose relation to reading impairment is disputed. We proposed that automatic detection and usage of serial sound regularities for individuals with Dyslexia_HP is impaired (anchoring deficit hypothesis), leading to the formation of less reliable sound predictions. Agus, Carrión-Castillo, Pressnitzer, and Ramus, (2014) reported seemingly contradictory evidence by showing similar performance by participants with and without Dyslexia_HP in a demanding auditory task that contained task-relevant regularities. To carefully assess the sensitivity of participants with Dyslexia_HP to regularities of this task, we replicated their study.

Dyslexics' faster decay of implicit memory for sounds and words is manifested in their shorter neural adaptation.Dyslexia_HP is a prevalent Dyslexia_HP whose underlying mechanisms are still disputed. We studied the neural mechanisms underlying Dyslexia_HP using a simple Frequency_HP-discrimination task. Though participants were asked to compare the two tones in each trial, implicit memory of previous trials Affected_HP their responses. We hypothesized that implicit memory decays faster among dyslexics. We tested this by increasing the temporal intervals between consecutive trials, and by measuring the behavioral impact and ERP responses from the auditory cortex. Dyslexics showed a faster decay of implicit memory effects on both measures, with similar time constants. Finally, faster decay of implicit memory also characterized the impact of sound regularities in benefitting dyslexics' oral reading rate. Their benefit decreased faster as a function of the time interval from the previous reading of the same non-word. We propose that dyslexics' shorter neural adaptation paradoxically accounts for their longer reading times, since it reduces their temporal window of integration of past stimuli, resulting in noisier and less reliable predictions for both simple and complex stimuli. Less reliable predictions limit their acquisition of reading expertise.

Effect of sports vision exercise on Visual_Perception_ASDPTO and reading performance in 7- to 10-year-old developmental dyslexic children.The presented study was aimed at identifying for the first time the influence of sports vision exercises on fundamental Motor_Skills_ASDPTO and cognitive skills of 7- to 10-year-old developmental dyslexic Persian children. A pretest-posttest quasi-experimental study was conducted. The statistical population of this study was 7- to 10-year-old dyslexic children referring to two centres of learning disorder in the city of Isfahan. Twenty two of these children were selected using available and purposive sampling from the statistical population and were randomly assigned into two groups of experimental and control. The former (experimental group) participated in sports vision exercise courses for 12 weeks (3 one hr sessions per week) and the latter (control group) continued their routine daily activities during the exercise. Before the beginning and at the end of the exercise, Gardner's test of Visual_Perception_ASDPTO test - revised and Dehkhoda's reading skills test was administered to both groups. The results showed that the sports vision exercises increases Motor_Skills_ASDPTO, visual perceptual skills and reading skills in developmental dyslexic children. Based on the results of the presented study it was concluded that sports vision exercises can be used for fundamental and cognitive skills of developmental dyslexic children.

Spelling and Morphology in Dyslexia_HP: A Developmental Study Across the School Years.The current study examined the effect of morphological knowledge on spelling development in Hebrew-speaking schoolchildren, adolescents and adults with Dyslexia_HP, compared with typically developing (TD) peers. Participants were 238 Hebrew-speaking readers of five grade levels of whom 139 were TD and 99 had developmental Dyslexia_HP (DD). Participants were tested on a function letter spelling task, a phonological awareness task and a morphological awareness task. The overall picture that emerged from the results is that performance on all measures increased with grade level, with TD participants always scoring higher than peers with DD. Moreover, the higher the morphological complexity in spelling and irregularity in noun inflection, the higher the differences between the DD and TD participants. Finally, performance on the morphological awareness task contributed to spelling morphologically more complex spelling items in the TD, but not in the DD group. From clinical and educational perspectives, these results strongly suggest that rigorous morphological instruction is necessary in teaching children and adolescents with Dyslexia_HP to identify and use morphological cues in spoken and written Hebrew.

Brain connectivity associated with cascading levels of language.Typical oral and written language learners (controls) (5 girls, 4 boys) completed fMRI reading judgment tasks (sub-word grapheme-phoneme, word spelling, sentences with and without spelling foils, affixed words, sentences with and without affix foils, and multi-sentence). Analyses identified connectivity within and across adjacent levels (units) of language in reading: from subword to word to syntax in Set I and from word to syntax to multi-sentence in Set II). Typicals were compared to (a) students with Dyslexia_HP (6 girls, 10 boys) on the subword and word tasks in Set I related to levels of language impaired in Dyslexia_HP, and (b) students with oral and written language learning disability (OWL LD) (3 girls, 2 boys) on the morphology and syntax tasks in Set II, related to levels of language impaired in OWL LD. Results for typical language learners showed that adjacent levels of language in the reading brain share common and unique connectivity. The Dyslexia_HP group showed over-connectivity to a greater degree on the imaging tasks related to their levels of Language_impairment_HP than the OWL LD group who showed under-connectivity to a greater degree than did the Dyslexia_HP group on the imaging tasks related to their levels of Language_impairment_HP. Results for these students in grades 4 to 9 (ages 9 to 14) are discussed in reference to the contribution of patterns of connectivity across levels of language to understanding the nature of persisting Dyslexia_HP and Dysgraphia_HP despite early intervention.

Preliminary Report on Neuroanatomical Differences Among Reading Disabled, Nonverbally Gifted, and Gifted-Reading Disabled College Students.Regional comparisons (cortical surface area and thickness) were performed on a well described sample of adults with Dyslexia_HP alone (RD), Absent_speech_HP giftedness alone (G), and Dyslexia_HP and Absent_speech_HP giftedness combined (GRD). These anatomical results are considered in relation to behavioral and functional work previously reported on this sample. GRD-RD regional differences were found in both hemispheres and were more common than GRD-G differences. Regional differences were found in the temporal, parietal, occipital and frontal lobes. While these data are preliminary given the small sample sizes, they suggest future avenues of research on the neurodevelopment of atypical samples.

A variance components model for statistical inference on functional connectivity networks.We propose a variance components linear modeling framework to conduct statistical inference on functional connectivity networks that directly accounts for the temporal autocorrelation inherent in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series data and for the Heterogeneous_HP across subjects in the study. The novel method estimates the autocorrelation structure in a nonparametric and subject-specific manner, and estimates the variance due to the Heterogeneous_HP using iterative least squares. We apply the new model to a resting-state fMRI study to compare the functional connectivity networks in both typical and reading impaired young adults in order to characterize the resting state networks that are related to reading processes. We also compare the performance of our model to other methods of statistical inference on functional connectivity networks that do not account for the temporal autocorrelation or Heterogeneous_HP across the subjects using simulated data, and show that by accounting for these sources of variation and covariation results in more powerful tests for statistical inference.

Electrophysiological basis of reading related phonological impairment in Chinese speakers with Schizophrenia_HP: An ERP study.It has been reported in alphabetic languages that individuals with Schizophrenia_HP showed language-related cognitive impairments including phonological deficits, which were in turn associated with clinical symptoms such as Auditory_Hallucinations_HP and thought disorders. To date, however, the phonological deficits involved in Schizophrenia_HP in Chinese and its neural basis have not been well established. In order to establish such a relationship we conducted a behavioral study using lexical tone judgment and digit span tasks as well as an event-related potential (ERP) study with an auditory oddball paradigm, in particular, for P300 effects, the event-related brain potential (ERP) index of discrimination. Chinese patients with Schizophrenia_HP and Chinese Healthy_HP controls in China participated in the current study. Compared to the Healthy_HP controls, the patients with Schizophrenia_HP showed significant impairments in phonological processing skills, which in turn significantly correlated with smaller P300 effects. Thus these behavioral and electrophysiological findings in Chinese patients with Schizophrenia_HP were critically evaluated in terms of their phonological processing abilities.

Auditory brainstem responses to stop consonants predict literacy.Precise temporal coding of speech plays a pivotal role in sound processing throughout the Central_HP auditory system, which, in turn, influences literacy acquisition. The current study tests whether an electrophysiological measure of this precision predicts literacy skills.

Reading in children with temporal lobe Epilepsy_ASDPTO: A systematic review.Children with Epilepsy_ASDPTO have higher rates of reading difficulties compared to the general population. Reading difficulties are associated with lower academic attainments, higher school drop-out rates, greater risk of unemployment, lower income, and poorer adjustment. We examined the literature dealing with reading in children with the most common type of Focal_HP Epilepsy_ASDPTO, temporal lobe Epilepsy_ASDPTO (TLE), in relation to: presence of reading difficulties, contributing factors, and efficacy of treatments for reading difficulties.

Arithmetic Abilities in Children With Developmental Dyslexia_HP: Performance on French ZAREKI-R Test.A high comorbidity between reading and arithmetic disabilities has already been reported. The present study aims at identifying more precisely patterns of arithmetic performance in children with developmental Dyslexia_HP, defined with Severe_HP and specific criteria. By means of a standardized test of achievement in mathematics ( Calculation and Number Processing Assessment Battery for Children; von Aster & Dellatolas, 2006), we analyzed the arithmetic abilities of 47 French children with Dyslexia_HP attending 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade. Of them, 40% displayed arithmetic deficits, mostly with regard to number transcoding and mental calculation. Their individual profiles of performance accounted for varying strengths and weaknesses in arithmetic abilities. Our findings showed the pathway for the development of arithmetic abilities in children with Dyslexia_HP is not unique. Our study contrasts with the hypotheses suggesting the mutual exclusiveness of the phonological representation deficit and the core number module deficit.

A specific implicit sequence learning deficit as an underlying cause of Dyslexia_HP? Investigating the role of attention in implicit learning tasks.Recently, a general implicit sequence learning deficit was proposed as an underlying cause of Dyslexia_HP. This new hypothesis was investigated in the present study by including a number of methodological improvements, for example, the inclusion of appropriate control conditions. The second goal of the study was to explore the role of attentional functioning in implicit and explicit learning tasks.

English as a Foreign Language in Bilingual Language-minority Children, Children with Dyslexia_HP and Monolingual Typical Readers.The present study was aimed at investigating literacy skills in English as a foreign language in three different groups of children: monolinguals with Dyslexia_HP (n = 19), typically developing bilinguals (language-minority) (n = 19) and a control group of monolinguals (Italian) (n = 76). Bilinguals were not expected to fail in English measures, and their gap with monolinguals would be expected to be limited to the instructional language, owing to underexposure. All participants were enrolled in Italian primary schools (fourth and fifth grades). A non-verbal Reasoning_ASDPTO task and Italian and English literacy tasks were administered. The Italian battery included word and non-word reading (speed and accuracy), word and non-word writing, and reading comprehension; the English battery included similar tasks, except for the non-word writing. Bilingual children performed similarly to typical readers in English tasks, whereas in Italian tasks, their performance was similar to that of typical readers in reading speed but not in reading accuracy and writing. Children with Dyslexia_HP underperformed compared with typically developing children in all English and Italian tasks, except for reading comprehension in Italian. Profile analysis and correlational analyses were further discussed. These results suggest that English as a foreign language might represent a challenge for students with Dyslexia_HP but a strength for bilingual language-minority children.

Morpheme-based Reading and Spelling in Italian Children with Developmental Dyslexia_HP and Dysorthography.Italian sixth graders, with and without Dyslexia_HP, read pseudowords and low-Frequency_HP words that include high-Frequency_HP morphemes better than stimuli not including any morpheme. The present study assessed whether morphemes Affect_ASDPTO (1) younger children, with and without Dyslexia_HP; (2) spelling as well as reading; and (3) words with low-Frequency_HP morphemes. Two groups of third graders (16 children with Dyslexia_HP and dysorthography and 16 age-matched typically developing children) read aloud and spelt to dictation pseudowords and words. Pseudowords included (1) root + suffix in not existing combinations (e.g. lampadista, formed by lampad-, 'lamp', and -ista, '-ist') and (2) orthographic sequences not corresponding to any Italian root or suffix (e.g. livonosto). Words had low Frequency_HP and included: (1) root + suffix, both of high Frequency_HP (e.g. bestiale, 'beastly'); (2) root + suffix, both of low Frequency_HP (e.g. asprigno, 'rather sour'); and (3) simple words (e.g. insulso, 'vapid'). Children with Dyslexia_HP and dysorthography were less accurate than typically developing children. Root + suffix pseudowords were read and spelt more accurately than non-morphological pseudowords by both groups. Morphologically complex (root + suffix) words were read and spelt better than simple words. However, task interacted with morphology: reading was not facilitated by low-Frequency_HP morphemes. We conclude that children acquiring a transparent orthography exploit morpheme-based reading and spelling to face difficulties in processing long unfamiliar stimuli.

Dyslexia_HP risk gene relates to representation of sound in the auditory brainstem.Dyslexia_HP is a reading disorder with strong associations with KIAA0319 and DCDC2. Both genes play a functional role in spike time precision of neurons. Strikingly, poor readers show an imprecise encoding of fast transients of speech in the auditory brainstem. Whether Dyslexia_HP risk genes are related to the quality of sound encoding in the auditory brainstem remains to be investigated. Here, we quantified the response consistency of speech-evoked brainstem responses to the acoustically presented syllable [da] in 159 genotyped, literate and preliterate children. When controlling for age, sex, familial risk and intelligence, partial correlation analyses associated a higher Dyslexia_HP risk loading with KIAA0319 with noisier responses. In contrast, a higher risk loading with DCDC2 was associated with a trend towards more Stable_HP responses. These results suggest that unStable_HP representation of sound, and thus, reduced neural discrimination ability of stop consonants, occurred in genotypes carrying a higher amount of KIAA0319 risk alleles. Current data provide the first evidence that the Dyslexia_HP-associated gene KIAA0319 can alter brainstem responses and impair phoneme processing in the auditory brainstem. This brain-gene relationship provides insight into the complex relationships between phenotype and genotype thereby improving the understanding of the Dyslexia_HP-inherent complex multifactorial condition.

Sequential Prediction of Literacy Achievement for Specific Learning Disabilities Contrasting in Impaired Levels of Language in Grades 4 to 9.Sequential regression was used to evaluate whether language-related Working_Memory_ASDPTO components uniquely predict Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO achievement beyond cognitive-linguistic translation for students in Grades 4 through 9 ( N = 103) with specific learning disabilities (SLDs) in subword handwriting (Dysgraphia_HP, n = 25), word reading and spelling (Dyslexia_HP, n = 60), or oral and written language (oral and written language learning disabilities, n = 18). That is, SLDs are defined on the basis of cascading level of Language_impairment_HP (subword, word, and syntax/text). A five-block regression model sequentially predicted literacy achievement from cognitive-linguistic translation (Block 1); Working_Memory_ASDPTO components for word-form coding (Block 2), phonological and orthographic loops (Block 3), and supervisory focused or switching attention (Block 4); and SLD groups (Block 5). Results showed that cognitive-linguistic translation explained an average of 27% and 15% of the variance in Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO achievement, respectively, but Working_Memory_ASDPTO components explained an additional 39% and 27% of variance. Orthographic word-form coding uniquely predicted nearly every measure, whereas attention switching uniquely predicted only reading. Finally, differences in Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO persisted between Dyslexia_HP and Dysgraphia_HP, with Dysgraphia_HP higher, even after controlling for Block 1 to 4 predictors. Differences in literacy achievement between students with Dyslexia_HP and oral and written language learning disabilities were largely explained by the Block 1 predictors. Applications to identifying and teaching students with these SLDs are discussed.

Predicting Future Reading Problems Based on Pre-reading Auditory Measures: A Longitudinal Study of Children with a Familial Risk of Dyslexia_HP. This longitudinal study examines measures of temporal auditory processing in pre-reading children with a family risk of Dyslexia_HP. Specifically, it attempts to ascertain whether pre-reading auditory processing, speech perception, and phonological awareness (PA) reliably predict later literacy achievement. Additionally, this study retrospectively examines the presence of pre-reading auditory processing, speech perception, and PA impairments in children later found to be literacy impaired.

Genes, Gender, Environment, and Novel Functions of Estrogen Receptor Beta in the Susceptibility to Neurodevelopmental Disorders.Many neurological disorders Affect_ASDPTO men and women differently regarding prevalence, progression, and Severity_HP. It is clear that many of these disorders may originate from defective signaling during fetal or perinatal brain development, which may Affect_ASDPTO males and females differently. Such sex-specific differences may originate from chromosomal or sex-hormone specific effects. This short review will focus on the estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) signaling during perinatal brain development and put it in the context of sex-specific differences in neurodevelopmental disorders. We will discuss ERβ's recent discovery in directing DNA de-methylation to specific sites, of which one such site may bear consequences for the susceptibility to the neurological reading disorder Dyslexia_HP. We will also discuss how dysregulations in sex-hormone signaling, like those evoked by endocrine disruptive chemicals, may Affect_ASDPTO this and other neurodevelopmental disorders in a sex-specific manner through ERβ.

The impact of multisensory instruction on learning letter names and sounds, word reading, and spelling.The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the use of simultaneous multisensory structured language instruction promoted better letter name and sound production, word reading, and word spelling for second grade children with typical development (N = 6) or with Dyslexia_HP (N = 5) than structured language instruction alone. The use of non-English graphemes (letters) to represent two pretend languages was used to control for children's lexical knowledge. A multiple baseline, multiple probe across subjects single-case design, with an embedded alternating treatments design, was used to compare the efficacy of multisensory and structured language interventions. Both interventions provided explicit systematic phonics instruction; however, the multisensory intervention also utilized simultaneous engagement of at least two sensory modalities (visual, auditory, and kinesthetic/tactile). Participant's graphed data was visually analyzed, and individual Tau-U and weighted Tau-U effect sizes were calculated for the outcome variables of letter name production, letter sound production, word reading, and word spelling. The multisensory intervention did not provide an advantage over the structured intervention for participants with typical development or Dyslexia_HP. However, both interventions had an overall treatment effect for participants with typical development and Dyslexia_HP, although intervention effects varied by outcome variable.

Mirrors are hard to break: A critical review and behavioral evidence on mirror-image processing in developmental Dyslexia_HP.The relation between reversal errors (e.g., d for b, Я for R) and developmental Dyslexia_HP has been elusive. In this study, we investigated the roles of reading level, visual category, and orientation processing in this relation. Children with developmental Dyslexia_HP, chronological-age-matched controls, and reading-level-matched controls performed two "same-different" matching tasks on reversible (e.g., b) and nonreversible (e.g., e) letters and on geometric shapes (e.g., ). In the orientation-based task, orientation processing was explicitly required; in the shape-based task, orientation processing would be automatic inasmuch as it was task irrelevant and would hinder successful performance. Two orientation contrasts were examined: mirror images (e.g., d-b) and plane rotations (e.g., d-p). For the latter, dyslexics behaved as controls; all were worse on shape-based judgments of plane rotation than on identical (e.g., d-d) pairs and were better able to attend to orientation than to shape. In contrast, for mirror images and across visual categories, dyslexics showed an advantage over typical readers on shape-based judgments. Both control groups had worse performance on shape-based judgments of mirror images than of identical pairs and exhibited similar magnitudes of mirror interference. Dyslexic children were the only group whose shape-based judgments were immune to mirror-image differences because they failed to automatize mirror discrimination during visual object processing. This deficit is not a consequence of reading level, is found across visual categories, and is specific to mirror images.

A Psychometric Tool for a Virtual Reality Rehabilitation Approach for Dyslexia_HP.Dyslexia_HP is a Chronic_HP problem that affects the life of subjects and often influences their life choices. The standard rehabilitation methods all use a classic paper and pencil training format but these exercises are boring and demanding for children who may have difficulty in completing the treatments. It is important to develop a new rehabilitation program that would help children in a funny and engaging way. A Wii-based game was developed to demonstrate that a short treatment with an action video game, rather than phonological or orthographic training, may improve the reading abilities in dyslexic children. According to the results, an approach using cues in the context of a virtual environment may represent a promising tool to improve attentional skills. On the other hand, our results do not demonstrate an immediate effect on reading performance, suggesting that a more Prolonged_HP protocol may be a future direction.

Pragmatics of language and theory of mind in children with Dyslexia_HP with associated language difficulties or Absent_speech_HP learning disabilities.The present study aims to find empirical evidence of deficits in linguistic pragmatic skills and theory of mind (ToM) in children with Dyslexia_HP with associated language difficulties or Absent_speech_HP learning disabilities (NLD), when compared with a group of typically developing (TD) children matched for age and gender. Our results indicate that children with Dyslexia_HP perform less well than TD children in most of the tasks measuring pragmatics of language, and in one of the tasks measuring ToM. In contrast, children with NLD generally performed better than the Dyslexia_HP group, and performed significantly worse than the TD children only in a metaphors task based on visual stimuli. A discriminant function analysis confirmed the crucial role of the metaphors subtest and the verbal ToM task in distinguishing between the groups. We concluded that, contrary to a generally-held assumption, children with Dyslexia_HP and associated language difficulties may be weaker than children with NLD in linguistic pragmatics and ToM, especially when language is crucially involved. The educational and clinical implications of these findings are discussed.

Beyond a Dyslexia_HP: comments on the need to examine the full spectrum of abilities/disabilities of the atypical dyslexic brain.A panel of practioners and researchers convened to consider how to advance a broader understanding of the neurocognitive profile of people with Dyslexia_HP. While a great deal of research has been conducted on the reading process, the panel recognized that the "Dyslexia_HP brain" may be unique in other ways as well. In particular, the panel focused on complex Absent_speech_HP/spatial skills and correlated attributes such as career choice. The conclusion of the panel was that there is more to be learned about how people with Dyslexia_HP reason spatially and how these qualities manifest in academic, personal, and career behaviors.

The conclusion of the panel was that there is more to be learned about how people with dyslexia reason spatially and how these qualities manifest in academic, personal, and career behaviors.
Differences in dyslexic students before and after a remediation program: A clinical neuropsychological and event related potential study.Developmental Dyslexia_HP is defined as an unexpected specific and persistent failure to acquire efficient reading skills despite conventional instruction, adequate intelligence and sociocultural opportunity. This article reports the outcomes of a study that evaluated the implementation of a 4-month intervention program. The intervention consisted of structured activities aiming at improving (a) the children's phonological awareness, (b) their visual and auditory memory, (c) their visual discrimination ability, and (d) their text comprehension. Participants were 12 children diagnosed as dyslexic matched with 12 typically achieving peers of similar age and gender. Baseline assessment consisted of a clinical neuropsychological battery of tests and Event Related Potentials (ERPs) and resulted in confirming the discrepancy between the dyslexic and the control group. Following the remediation program, the dyslexic group did not differ significantly from their control group in six out of eight neuropsychological tests. The electrophysiological results revealed that the two groups had similar P300 latencies in 12 out of the 15 electroencephalographic sites assessed. These findings suggest that children with Dyslexia_HP can improve their abilities through a remediation program which aims to strengthen their audio-visual and phonological processes along with their Working_Memory_ASDPTO capability.

The Dyslexia_HP-susceptibility Protein KIAA0319 Inhibits Axon Growth Through Smad2 Signaling.KIAA0319 is a transmembrane protein associated with Dyslexia_HP with a presumed role in neuronal migration. Here we show that KIAA0319 expression is not restricted to the brain but also occurs in sensory and spinal cord neurons, increasing from early postnatal stages to adulthood and being downregulated by injury. This suggested that KIAA0319 participates in functions unrelated to neuronal migration. Supporting this hypothesis, overexpression of KIAA0319 repressed axon growth in hippocampal and dorsal root ganglia neurons; the intracellular domain of KIAA0319 was sufficient to elicit this effect. A similar inhibitory effect was observed in vivo as axon regeneration was impaired after transduction of sensory neurons with KIAA0319. Conversely, the deletion of Kiaa0319 in neurons increased neurite outgrowth in vitro and improved axon regeneration in vivo. At the mechanistic level, KIAA0319 engaged the JAK2-SH2B1 pathway to activate Smad2, which played a Central_HP role in KIAA0319-mediated repression of axon growth. In summary, we establish KIAA0319 as a novel player in axon growth and regeneration with the ability to repress the intrinsic growth potential of axons. This study describes a novel regulatory mechanism operating during Peripheral_HP nervous system and Central_HP nervous system axon growth, and offers novel targets for the development of effective therapies to promote axon regeneration.

Deficits in Letter-Speech Sound Associations but Intact Visual Conflict Processing in Dyslexia_HP: Results from a Novel ERP-Paradigm.The reading and spelling deficits characteristic of developmental Dyslexia_HP (Dyslexia_HP) have been related to problems in phonological processing and in learning associations between letters and speech-sounds. Even when children with Dyslexia_HP have learned the letters and their corresponding speech sounds, letter-speech sound associations might still be less automatized compared to children with age-adequate literacy skills. In order to examine automaticity in letter-speech sound associations and to overcome some of the disadvantages associated with the frequently used visual-auditory oddball paradigm, we developed a novel electrophysiological letter-speech sound interference paradigm. This letter-speech sound interference paradigm was applied in a group of 9-year-old children with Dyslexia_HP (

Reading problems and major Mental_Disorders_ASDPTO - co-occurrences and familial overlaps in a Swedish nationwide cohort.Reading problems often co-occur with ADHD and conduct disorder. However, the patterns of co-occurrence and familial overlap between reading problems and other Behavioral_abnormality_HP have not been systematically explored. We conducted a register-based cohort study including 8719 individuals with reading problems and their siblings, along with matched comparison individuals. Conditional logistic regressions estimated risks for ADHD, Autism_HP, Obsessive-Compulsive_Disorder_ASDPTO, Anorexia_HP nervosa, Schizophrenia_HP, Bipolar_Disorder_ASDPTO, Depression_ASDPTO, substance use disorder, and violent/non-violent criminality in individuals with reading problems and their siblings. Diagnoses of Behavioral_abnormality_HP were physician-assigned and ascertained from the Swedish National Patient Register, and crime convictions from the Swedish National Crime Register. We found that individuals with reading problems had excess risks for all Behavioral_abnormality_HP (except Anorexia_HP nervosa) and criminality, with risk ratios between 1.34 and 4.91. Siblings of individuals with reading problems showed excess risks for ADHD, Autism_HP, Schizophrenia_HP, Bipolar_Disorder_ASDPTO, Depression_ASDPTO, substance use disorder, and non-violent criminality, with risk ratios between 1.14 and 1.70. In summary, individuals with reading problems had increased risks of virtually all Behavioral_abnormality_HP, and criminality. The origin of most of these overlaps was familial, in that siblings of individuals with reading problems also had elevated risks of ADHD, Autism_HP, Schizophrenia_HP, Bipolar_Disorder_ASDPTO, Depression_ASDPTO, substance use disorder, and non-violent criminality. These findings have implications for gene-searching efforts, and suggest that health care practitioners should be alert for signs of Behavioral_abnormality_HP in families where reading problems exist.

Evidence for a differential interference of noise in sub-lexical and lexical reading routes in Healthy_HP participants and dyslexics.The ineffective exclusion of surrounding noise has been proposed to underlie the reading deficits in developmental Dyslexia_HP. However, previous studies supporting this hypothesis focused on low-level visual tasks, providing only an indirect link of noise interference on reading processes. In this study, we investigated the effect of noise on regular, irregular, and pseudoword reading in 23 dyslexic children and 26 age- and IQ-matched controls, by applying the white noise displays typically used to validate this theory to a lexical decision task. Reading performance and eye movements were measured. Results showed that white noise did not consistently Affect_ASDPTO dyslexic readers more than typical readers. Noise Affect_ASDPTOed more dyslexic than typical readers in terms of reading accuracy, but it Affect_ASDPTOed more typical than dyslexic readers in terms of response time and eye movements (number of fixations and regressions). Furthermore, in typical readers, noise Affect_ASDPTOed more the speed of reading of pseudowords than real words. These results suggest a particular impact of noise on the sub-lexical reading route where attention has to be deployed to individual letters. The use of a lexical route would reduce the effect of noise. A differential impact of noise between words and pseudowords may therefore not be evident in dyslexic children if they are not yet proficient in using the lexical route. These findings indicate that the type of reading stimuli and consequent reading strategies play an important role in determining the effects of noise interference in reading processing and should be taken into account by further studies.

A formal analysis of Alexia_HP in persistent aura and a comparison to acquired pure Alexia_HP.A patient is reported with reversible pure Alexia_HP in the context of Migraine_with_aura_HP. Following previous, anecdotal reports, the present study is the first to formally assess word reading, writing, and other linguistic and visual processing and to compare these to a patient with Stroke_HP-related pure Alexia_HP. The reading impairment, suggestive of letter-by-letter reading, was observed across 7 days but had remitted at a 3-month follow-up. The deficit also Affected_HP recognition of letters, suggesting a functional impairment at the level of letter recognition, not just word reading. It went along with reversible abnormalities in diffusion-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging in areas known to be involved in word reading.

Problems with visual statistical learning in developmental Dyslexia_HP.Previous research shows that dyslexic readers are impaired in their recognition of faces and other complex objects, and show hypoactivation in ventral visual stream regions that support word and object recognition. Responses of these brain regions are shaped by visual statistical learning. If such learning is compromised, people should be less sensitive to statistically likely feature combinations in words and other objects, and impaired visual word and object recognition should be expected. We therefore tested whether people with Dyslexia_HP showed diminished capability for visual statistical learning. Matched dyslexic and typical readers participated in tests of visual statistical learning of pairs of novel shapes that frequently appeared together. Dyslexic readers on average recognized fewer pairs than typical readers, indicating some problems with visual statistical learning. These group differences were not accounted for by differences in intelligence, ability to remember individual shapes, or spatial attention paid to the stimuli, but other attentional problems could play a mediating role. Deficiencies in visual statistical learning may in some cases prevent appropriate experience-driven shaping of neuronal responses in the ventral visual stream, hampering visual word and object recognition.

Local and global processing in block design tasks in children with Dyslexia_HP or Absent_speech_HP learning disability.Visuo-constructive and perceptual abilities have been poorly investigated in children with learning disabilities. The present study focused on local or global visuospatial processing in children with Absent_speech_HP learning disability (NLD) and Dyslexia_HP compared with typically-developing (TD) controls. Participants were presented with a modified block design task (BDT), in both a typical visuo-constructive version that involves reconstructing figures from blocks, and a perceptual version in which respondents must rapidly match unfragmented figures with a corresponding fragmented target figure. The figures used in the tasks were devised by manipulating two variables: the perceptual cohesiveness and the task uncertainty, stimulating global or local processes. Our results confirmed that children with NLD had more problems with the visuo-constructive version of the task, whereas those with Dyslexia_HP showed only a slight difficulty with the visuo-constructive version, but were in greater difficulty with the perceptual version, especially in terms of response times. These findings are interpreted in relation to the slower visual processing speed of children with Dyslexia_HP, and to the visuo-constructive problems and difficulty in using flexibly-experienced global vs local processes of children with NLD. The clinical and educational implications of these findings are discussed.

Revisiting the "enigma" of musicians with Dyslexia_HP: Auditory sequencing and speech abilities.Previous research has suggested a link between musical training and auditory processing skills. Musicians have shown enhanced perception of auditory features critical to both music and speech, suggesting that this link extends beyond basic auditory processing. It remains unclear to what extent musicians who also have Dyslexia_HP show these specialized abilities, considering often-observed persistent deficits that coincide with reading impairments. The present study evaluated auditory sequencing and speech discrimination in 52 adults comprised of musicians with Dyslexia_HP, nonmusicians with Dyslexia_HP, and typical musicians. An auditory sequencing task measuring perceptual acuity for tone sequences of increasing length was administered. Furthermore, subjects were asked to discriminate synthesized syllable continua varying in acoustic components of speech necessary for intraphonemic discrimination, which included spectral (formant Frequency_HP) and temporal (voice Onset_HP time [VOT] and amplitude envelope) features. Results indicate that musicians with Dyslexia_HP did not significantly differ from typical musicians and performed better than nonmusicians with Dyslexia_HP for auditory sequencing as well as discrimination of spectral and VOT cues within syllable continua. However, typical musicians demonstrated superior performance relative to both groups with Dyslexia_HP for discrimination of syllables varying in amplitude information. These findings suggest a distinct profile of speech processing abilities in musicians with Dyslexia_HP, with specific weaknesses in discerning amplitude cues within speech. Because these difficulties seem to remain persistent in adults with Dyslexia_HP despite musical training, this study only partly supports the potential for musical training to enhance the auditory processing skills known to be crucial for literacy in individuals with Dyslexia_HP.

Exploring the impact of living with Dyslexia_HP: The perspectives of children and their parents.A small but growing body of literature indicates that children with Dyslexia_HP are at elevated risk of internalising and externalising mental health problems. However, little research addresses why this might be the case, particularly from the point of view of the children or their parents. This study therefore aimed to explore the lived experiences of children with Dyslexia_HP, and their parents.

Neural Noise Hypothesis of Developmental Dyslexia_HP.Developmental Dyslexia_HP (decoding-based reading disorder; RD) is a complex trait with multifactorial origins at the genetic, neural, and cognitive levels. There is evidence that low-level sensory-processing deficits precede and underlie phonological problems, which are one of the best-documented aspects of RD. RD is also associated with impairments in integrating visual symbols with their corresponding speech sounds. Although causal relationships between sensory processing, print-speech integration, and fluent reading, and their neural bases are debated, these processes all require precise timing mechanisms across distributed brain networks. Neural excitability and neural noise are fundamental to these timing mechanisms. Here, we propose that neural noise stemming from increased neural excitability in cortical networks implicated in reading is one key Distal_HP contributor to RD.

Dyslexia_HP Spectrum: Early and Late Recognition, Subthreshold, and Full Comorbidity.Several studies have reported high comorbidity for Dyslexia_HP (RD) and Behavioral_abnormality_HP. The aim of this study was to investigate the comorbidity of subthreshold and full Behavioral_abnormality_HP with RD while comparing subgroups based on age of RD recognition (early vs. late). We analyzed data from 130 children with RD and 82 typically developing children aged 7 to 18 years. RD was assessed with the Dyslexia_HP Differential Diagnosis_ASDPTO Maastricht-Hungarian Standard Test. Psychiatric diagnoses were based on the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Kid. Chi-square tests were used for group comparisons of the prevalence of subthreshold and full disorders. A higher proportion of children in the RD group were assessed as having internalizing or externalizing disorders. When subthreshold and full diagnoses were considered together, the prevalence of internalizing but not externalizing pathology was higher in the RD group than the control group. The prevalence of internalizing pathology was similar in the early and late RD subgroups, but externalizing pathology was more common in the late RD subgroup. When subthreshold and full diagnoses were considered together, Mood_ASDPTO disorder and externalizing pathology were more prevalent in the late RD subgroup than the early RD subgroup. This study demonstrated that early recognition of RD may play a role in determining comorbid psychopathology and should therefore be an educational and clinical priority. Clinicians should routinely screen children with RD for comorbid disorders, including subthreshold pathology.

When subthreshold and full diagnoses were considered together, mood disorder and externalizing pathology were more prevalent in the late RD subgroup than the early RD subgroup. This study demonstrated that early recognition of RD may play a role in determining comorbid psychopathology and should therefore be an educational and clinical priority. Clinicians should routinely screen children with RD for comorbid disorders, including subthreshold pathology.
Language_impairment_HP and retrospectively reported sexual abuse of girls: Severity_HP and disclosure.Despite emerging evidence for an association between communication disorders and maltreatment, little research has examined sexual abuse characteristics or disclosure experiences among individuals with Language_impairment_HP (LD). Given that communication difficulties may constitute a barrier to disclosure, the disclosure experiences among individuals with and without communication difficulties may also differ.

Effect of chunk strength on the performance of children with developmental Dyslexia_HP on artificial grammar learning task may be related to complexity.There's a long held view that chunks play a crucial role in artificial grammar learning performance. We compared chunk strength influences on performance, in high and low topological entropy (a measure of complexity) grammar systems, with dyslexic children, age-matched and reading-level-matched control participants. Findings show that age-matched control participants' performance reflected equivalent influence of chunk strength in the two topological entropy conditions, as typically found in artificial grammar learning experiments. By contrast, dyslexic children and reading-level-matched controls' performance reflected knowledge of chunk strength only under the low topological entropy condition. In the low topological entropy grammar system, they appeared completely unable to utilize chunk strength to make appropriate test item selections. In line with previous research, this study suggests that for typically developing children, it is the chunks that are attended during artificial grammar learning and create a foundation on which implicit associative learning mechanisms operate, and these chunks are unitized to different strengths. However, for children with Dyslexia_HP, it is complexity that may influence the subsequent memorability of chunks, independently of their strength.

Multi-step treatment for acquired Alexia_HP and agraphia (Part I): efficacy, generalisation, and identification of beneficial treatment steps.Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO impairments are common in individuals with post-Stroke_HP Aphasia_HP. Treatment typically aims to improve the function of one of these modalities by strengthening aspects of either lexical or sublexical processing. In the present study, eight adults with acquired Alexia_HP and agraphia were administered a comprehensive treatment targeting specific lexical and sublexical processes underlying reading and/or writing. Two participants were trained in reading and six were trained in writing. Throughout treatment, Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO accuracy were monitored for trained items, as well as untrained but orthographically and semantically related items. Linear mixed effects models indicated that the most substantial gains were made on trained items in the trained modality; generalisation to trained items in the untrained modality and untrained but related items in both modalities was also observed. Participants improved significantly on a subset of treatment steps intended to address lexical access and representations, sublexical conversion mechanisms, and the graphemic and/or phonological buffer processes in both modalities. These results demonstrate the efficacy of a novel, comprehensive treatment protocol and suggest that targeting multiple Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO processes in conjunction may facilitate widespread generalisation.

[Brodmann Areas 39 and 40: Human Parietal Association Area and Higher Cortical Function].The anatomy and function of the angular gyrus (Brodmann Area 39) and supramarginal gyrus (Brodmann Area 40) are described here. Both gyri constitute the inferior part of the parietal lobe. Association fibers from the angular gyrus project to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex via the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) II/arcuate fasciculus (AF), whereas those from the supramarginal gyrus project to the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex via SLF III/AF. Damage to the Left_HP angular gyrus causes kanji agraphia (lexical agraphia) and Mild_HP Anomia_HP, whereas damage to the Left_HP supramarginal gyrus causes kana Alexia_HP (phonological Dyslexia_HP) and kana agraphia (phonological agraphia). Damage to either gyrus causes Gerstmann's syndrome (Finger_Agnosia_HP, Left_HP-Right_HP Confusion_HP, agraphia and acalculia) and verbal short-term Memory_impairment_HP. "Angular Alexia_HP with agraphia" results from damage to the middle occipital gyrus posterior to the angular gyrus. Alexia_HP and agraphia, with lesions in the angular or supramarginal gyrus, are characterized by kana transposition errors in reading words, which suggests the impairment of sequential phonological processing.

Neurodevelopmental outcomes of neonates undergoing surgery under general anesthesia for Intestinal_Intestinal_Intestinal_malrotation_HP of intestines.It is difficult to differentiate between the potential adverse effects of general anesthesia (GA) on the developing brain and the role of associated co-morbidities and syndromes that can adversely Affect_ASDPTO neurodevelopmental outcomes in neonates undergoing GA. Neonates with Intestinal_Intestinal_Intestinal_malrotation_HP of the intestines without Volvulus_HP usually do not have co-morbidities or syndromes. In addition, majority of them recover very well after surgery and are discharged home within a few days. Neonates with Intestinal_Intestinal_Intestinal_malrotation_HP are a clean cohort of babies to study the role of a single episode of GA on the developing brain.

Design and Implementation of a Tactile Stimulation Device to Increase Auditory Discrimination.Reading is a complex process that requires various simultaneous brain processes. One of the most common types of reading disorders is developmental Dyslexia_HP, and one of the objectives of speech therapy sessions for children with developmental Dyslexia_HP is to increase their auditory discrimination. One of the most commonly used Auditory Discrimination Tests (ADTs) is Wepman's  Auditory Discrimination Test (WADT). It includes minimal pair words categorized by characteristics of vowels and consonants. The goal of this research is to design and implement a tactile stimulation device based on Wepman's test to increase auditory discrimination in children with developmental Dyslexia_HP in therapy sessions, so that while playing each word for the children, vibrational cues are presented to their Left_HP palm and fingers. The vibrational cues provided by 23 vibration motors can notify the child of the difference or similarity between the words. First, the device was evaluated by being applied on six female participants aged 6 to 8 with no hearing disabilities and no developmental Dyslexia_HP. Scores obtained from the Healthy_HP children showed that they can perceive the tactile function of the device. Then, function of the device was tested on 8-year-old twin girls with developmental Dyslexia_HP. The test was conducted as a controlled experiment. One of the twins participated in speech therapy treatment, while the other practiced with the device. During the study, three sessions were allocated to determine the baseline of auditory discrimination, three sessions to the intervention, and two sessions (the first, one week and the second, three weeks after the intervention sessions) to determine the children's auditory discrimination (follow-up). The analysis of trend variations and changes in mean showed that both the speech therapy and the intervention based on practicing with the device were effective in increasing children's auditory discrimination (Percentage of Non-overlapping Data = 100%). The results were Stable_HP three weeks after the intervention sessions. Therefore, using the device in speech therapy sessions can be useful and effective in improving auditory discrimination.

Shared temporoparietal dysfunction in Dyslexia_HP and typical readers with discrepantly high IQ.It is currently believed that Dyslexia_HP (RD) should be defined by reading level without regard to broader aptitude (IQ). There is debate, however, about how to classify individuals who read in the typical range but less well than would be expected by their higher IQ. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 49 children to examine whether those with typical, but discrepantly low reading ability relative to IQ, show Dyslexia_HP-like activation patterns during reading. Children who were typical readers with high-IQ discrepancy showed reduced activation in Left_HP temporoparietal neocortex relative to two control groups of typical readers without IQ discrepancy. This pattern was consistent and spatially overlapping with results in children with RD compared to typically reading children. The results suggest a shared neurological atypicality in regions associated with phonological processing between children with Dyslexia_HP and children with typical reading ability that is substantially below their IQ.

15q11.2 CNV affects cognitive, structural and functional correlates of Dyslexia_HP and Dyscalculia_HP.Several copy number variants have been associated with neuroBehavioral_abnormality_HP and these variants have been shown to also influence cognitive abilities in carriers Unaffected_HP by Behavioral_abnormality_HP. Previously, we associated the 15q11.2(BP1-BP2) deletion with specific learning disabilities and a larger corpus callosum. Here we investigate, in a much larger sample, the effect of the 15q11.2(BP1-BP2) deletion on cognitive, structural and functional correlates of Dyslexia_HP and Dyscalculia_HP. We report that the deletion confers greatest risk of the combined phenotype of Dyslexia_HP and Dyscalculia_HP. We also show that the deletion associates with a smaller Left_HP fusiform gyrus. Moreover, tailored functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments using phonological lexical decision and multiplication verification tasks demonstrate altered activation in the Left_HP fusiform and the Left_HP angular gyri in carriers. Thus, by using convergent evidence from neuropsychological testing, and structural and functional neuroimaging, we show that the 15q11.2(BP1-BP2) deletion affects cognitive, structural and functional correlates of both Dyslexia_HP and Dyscalculia_HP.

An oscillopathic approach to developmental Dyslexia_HP: From genes to speech processing.Developmental Dyslexia_HP is a Heterogeneous_HP condition entailing problems with reading and spelling. Several genes have been linked or associated to the disease, many of which contribute to the development and function of brain areas important for auditory and phonological processing. Nonetheless, a clear link between genes, the brain, and the symptoms of Dyslexia_HP is still pending. The goal of this paper is contributing to bridge this gap. With this aim, we have focused on how the dyslexic brain fails to process speech sounds and reading cues. We have adopted an oscillatory perspective, according to which Dyslexia_HP may result from a deficient integration of different brain rhythms during reading/spellings tasks. Moreover, we show that some candidate genes for this condition are related to brain rhythms. This fresh approach is expected to provide a better understanding of the aetiology and the clinical presentation of developmental Dyslexia_HP, but also to achieve an earlier and more accurate Diagnosis_ASDPTO of the disease.

Encoding of rapid time-varying information is impaired in poor readers.A characteristic set of eye movements and fixations are made during reading, so the Position_HP of words on the retinae is constantly being updated. Effective decoding of print requires this temporal stream of visual information to be segmented or parsed into its constituent units (e.g., letters or words). Poor readers' difficulties with word recognition could arise at the point of segmenting time-varying visual information, but the mechanisms underlying this process are little understood. Here, we used random-dot displays to explore the effects of reading ability on temporal segmentation. Thirty-eight adult readers viewed test stimuli that were temporally segmented by constraining either local motions or analogous form cues to oscillate back and fourth at each of a range of rates. Participants had to discriminate these segmented patterns from comparison stimuli containing the same motion and form cues but these were temporally intermingled. Results showed that the motion and form tasks could not be performed reliably when segment duration was shorter than a temporal resolution (acuity) limit. The acuity limits for both tasks were significantly and negatively correlated with reading scores. Importantly, the minimum segment duration needed to detect the temporally segmented stimuli was longer in relatively poor readers than relatively good readers. This demonstrates that adult poor readers have difficulty segmenting temporally changing visual input particularly at short segment durations. These results are consistent with evidence suggesting that precise encoding of rapid time-varying information is impaired in developmental Dyslexia_HP.

Psychological Well-being Trajectories of Individuals with Dyslexia_HP Aged 3-11 Years.Dyslexia_HP has been associated with a range of psychological well-being issues in childhood. However, it is unclear if these difficulties stem from coping with academic struggles at school, or from other pre-existing diagnoses that sometimes co-occur with Dyslexia_HP. Using UK Millennium Cohort Study data (n = 7224) from 2003 to 2011, the present study compared psychological well-being development from ages 3-11 years for children with (1) Dyslexia_HP only; (2) special educational needs excluding Dyslexia_HP; (3) comorbid Dyslexia_HP and other special educational needs; and (4) no special educational needs. Growth curve modelling results controlling for race, gender, age and family income suggested that with the exception of conduct difficulties, psychological well-being issues related to Dyslexia_HP do not occur preschool; rather, they commence upon starting school.

Word Decoding Development during Phonics Instruction in Children at Risk for Dyslexia_HP.In the present study, we examined the early word decoding development of 73 children at genetic risk of Dyslexia_HP and 73 matched controls. We conducted monthly curriculum-embedded word decoding measures during the first 5 months of phonics-based reading instruction followed by standardized word decoding measures halfway and by the end of first grade. In kindergarten, vocabulary, phonological awareness, lexical retrieval, and verbal and visual short-term memory were assessed. The results showed that the children at risk were less skilled in phonemic awareness in kindergarten. During the first 5 months of reading instruction, children at risk were less efficient in word decoding and the discrepancy increased over the months. In subsequent months, the discrepancy prevailed for simple words but increased for more complex words. Phonemic awareness and lexical retrieval predicted the reading development in children at risk and controls to the same extent. It is concluded that children at risk are behind their typical peers in word decoding development starting from the very beginning. Furthermore, it is concluded that the disadvantage increased during phonics instruction and that the same predictors underlie the development of word decoding in the two groups of children.

Can you spell Dyslexia_HP without SLI? Comparing the cognitive profiles of Dyslexia_HP and specific Language_impairment_HP and their roles in learning.The aim of the present study is to explore whether those with Specific Language_impairment_HP (SLI) and Dyslexia_HP display distinct or overlapping cognitive profiles with respect to learning outcomes. In particular, we were interested in two key cognitive skills associated with academic performance - Working_Memory_ASDPTO and IQ. We recruited three groups of children - those with SLI, those with Dyslexia_HP, and a control group. All children were given standardized tests of Working_Memory_ASDPTO, IQ (vocabulary and matrix), spelling, and math. The pattern of results suggests that both children with Dyslexia_HP and SLI are characterized with poorer verbal Working_Memory_ASDPTO and IQ compared to controls, but preserved Absent_speech_HP cognitive skills. It appears that that these two disorder groups cannot be distinguished by the Severity_HP of their Cognitive_impairment_HP. However, there was a differential pattern with respect to learning outcomes, where the children with Dyslexia_HP rely more on visual skills in spelling, while those with SLI use their relative strengths in vocabulary. These findings can have important implications for how intervention is tailored in the classroom, as disorder-specific support could yield important gains in learning.

Two year outcomes of postStroke_HP writing and reading disorders.PostStroke_HP language disorders are Frequent_HP and include Aphasia_HP, Alexia_HP, agraphia, and acalculia. These disorders refer to an acquired inability to read, write and calculate. In this study, we evaluated the two year outcomes of writing and reading disorders in postStroke_HP patients, the natural course, recovery and mortality. We evaluated all the patients with Stroke_HP who were admitted to the Department of Neurology, University Clinical Centre Tuzla in period of six months, who developed postStroke_HP Alexia_HP, agraphia, acalculia, or different combinations of these language disorders. Outcome of these patients was evaluated again after 24 months. For clinical assessment of Alexia_HP, agraphia, and acalculia we used Minnesota Test for Differential Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Aphasia_HP. We investigated 59 (30.5%) of 193 Stroke_HP patients with Alexia_HP, agraphia, acalculia, and combinations. Outcome of these patients after 24 months was: 37 (62.7%) died, 13 (22%) fully recovered, and 9 (15.3%) of them retained the same disorder or developed Dementia_HP or Blindness_HP. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that patients with combined language disorders had significantly higher mortality. The main factors influencing language disorders recovery in this study are initial Severity_HP of reading, writing and calculation impairment, age, neglect, and level of education.
Two year outcomes of poststroke writing and reading disorders.Poststroke language disorders are frequent and include aphasia, alexia, agraphia, and acalculia.

Verbal and Non-verbal Fluency in Adults with Developmental Dyslexia_HP: Phonological Processing or Executive Control Problems?The Executive_Function_ASDPTO of fluency describes the ability to generate items according to specific rules. Production of words beginning with a certain letter (phonemic fluency) is impaired in Dyslexia_HP, while generation of words belonging to a certain semantic category (semantic fluency) is typically unimpaired. However, in Dyslexia_HP, verbal fluency has generally been studied only in terms of overall words produced. Furthermore, performance of adults with Dyslexia_HP on non-verbal design fluency tasks has not been explored but would indicate whether deficits could be explained by executive control, rather than phonological processing, difficulties. Phonemic, semantic and design fluency tasks were presented to adults with Dyslexia_HP and without Dyslexia_HP, using fine-grained performance measures and controlling for IQ. Hierarchical regressions indicated that Dyslexia_HP predicted lower phonemic fluency, but not semantic or design fluency. At the fine-grained level, Dyslexia_HP predicted a smaller number of switches between subcategories on phonemic fluency, while Dyslexia_HP did not predict the size of phonemically related clusters of items. Overall, the results suggested that phonological processing problems were at the root of Dyslexia_HP-related fluency deficits; however, executive control difficulties could not be completely ruled out as an alternative explanation. Developments in research methodology, equating executive demands across fluency tasks, may resolve this issue. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Short-term Memory in Childhood Dyslexia_HP: Deficient Serial Order in Multiple Modalities.In children with Dyslexia_HP, deficits in Working_Memory_ASDPTO have not been well-specified. We assessed second-grade children with Dyslexia_HP, with and without concomitant specific Language_impairment_HP, and children with typical development. Immediate serial recall of lists of phonological (non-word), lexical (digit), spatial (location) and visual (shape) items were included. For the latter three modalities, we used not only standard span but also running span tasks, in which the list length was unpredictable to limit mnemonic strategies. Non-word repetition tests indicated a phonological memory deficit in children with Dyslexia_HP alone compared with those with typical development, but this difference vanished when these groups were matched for non-verbal intelligence and language. Theoretically important deficits in serial order memory in dyslexic children, however, persisted relative to matched typically developing children. The deficits were in recall of (1) spoken digits in both standard and running span tasks and (2) spatial locations, in running span only. Children with Dyslexia_HP with versus without Language_impairment_HP, when matched on non-verbal intelligence, had comparable serial order memory, but differed in phonology. Because serial orderings of verbal and spatial elements occur in reading, the careful examination of order memory may allow a deeper understanding of Dyslexia_HP and its relation to Language_impairment_HP.

Spatiotemporal reorganization of the reading network in adult Dyslexia_HP.Developmental Dyslexia_HP is characterized by impairments in reading fluency and spelling that persist into adulthood. Here, we hypothesized that high-achieving adult dyslexics (i.e., university students with a history of Dyslexia_HP) manage to cope with these deficits by relying to a greater extent on morphological information than do non-impaired adult readers. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) in a primed lexical decision task, in which we contrasted orthographic, morphological and semantic processing. Behavioral results confirmed that adult dyslexics did indeed rely to a greater extent on the semantic properties of morphemes than controls. In line with this, MEG results showed early morphological effects (100-200 msec) in a frontal network, which reflected the contribution of semantic processing. The same effects occurred much later in controls (∼400 msec). In contrast, controls showed early orthographic priming effects in posterior Left_HP inferior temporal gyrus (LITG) at around 130 msec, which were not seen in dyslexics. In the LITG, dyslexics showed only late activation of semantic and orthographic information. The present results suggest a spatiotemporal reorganization of the reading network, in which morphological information located in frontal regions is activated earlier in high-achieving adults dyslexics than controls.

Awareness in the crowd: Beta power and alpha phase of prestimulus oscillations predict object discrimination in visual crowding.Visual crowding is among the factors that most hamper conscious object perception. However, we currently ignore the neural states that predispose to an accurate perception within different crowding regimes. Here, we performed single-trial analyses of the electroencephalographical (EEG) oscillations, evaluating the prestimulus power and phase differences between correct and incorrect discrimination during a letter-crowding task, where irrelevant letters were placed nearby (strong crowding) or far (mid crowding) relative to the target. Results show that prestimulus alpha (8-12Hz) power was related to target discrimination in the mid, but not in the strong, crowding condition. Importantly, accurate discrimination in the strong crowding condition was predicted by the phase of alpha and by the power of beta (13-20Hz) oscillations. These evidence suggest that both Periodic_HP visual sampling mechanisms, reflected in the alpha phase, and network predisposition to extract local information, reflected in the beta power, predispose to object discrimination in a crowded scene.

Audiovisual speech integration in the superior temporal region is dysfunctional in Dyslexia_HP.Dyslexia_HP is an impairment of reading and spelling that affects both children and adults even after many years of schooling. Dyslexic readers have deficits in the integration of auditory and visual inputs but the neural mechanisms of the deficits are still unclear. This fMRI study examined the neural processing of auditorily presented German numbers 0-9 and videos of lip movements of a German native speaker voicing numbers 0-9 in unimodal (auditory or visual) and bimodal (always congruent) conditions in dyslexic readers and their matched fluent readers. We confirmed results of previous studies that the superior temporal gyrus/sulcus plays a critical role in audiovisual speech integration: fluent readers showed greater superior temporal activations for combined audiovisual stimuli than auditory-/visual-only stimuli. Importantly, such an enhancement effect was absent in dyslexic readers. Moreover, the auditory network (Bilateral_HP superior temporal regions plus medial PFC) was dynamically modulated during audiovisual integration in fluent, but not in dyslexic readers. These results suggest that superior temporal dysfunction may underly poor audiovisual speech integration in readers with Dyslexia_HP.

The effects of the constancy of location and order in Working_Memory_ASDPTO visual-phonological binding of children with Dyslexia_HP.It has been suggested that children with Dyslexia_HP have difficulties in visual-phonological Working_Memory_ASDPTO (WM) binding, supporting the hypothesis that this ability is crucial in the formation of associations between written forms and phonological codes required by reading. However, research on this topic is currently scarce and has not clarified to what extent binding may be supported by spatial and temporal information. The present study examined visual-phonological WM binding performance in a group of children with Dyslexia_HP compared to a control group of typically developing children matched for age, gender, and grade. Children had to memorize ephemeral associations between meaningless shapes and nonwords, with stimuli presented in either fixed or variable spatial locations, and in either fixed or variable temporal order across trials; performance was assessed using a recognition task. Results showed that children with Dyslexia_HP have a deficit in visual-phonological WM binding in every presentation condition and that, unlike control children, they are not able to use fixed spatial locations as an aid to bind information. Crucially, however, children with Dyslexia_HP still benefit from the presentation of stimuli in a fixed temporal order. These findings support the hypothesis that a WM binding deficit is crucial in children with Dyslexia_HP, and have potential implications for treatment strategies.

Reading difficulties in primary Progressive_HP Aphasia_HP in a regular language-speaking cohort of patients.Reading impairment is an important feature in Primary Progressive_HP Aphasia_HP (PPA). The Spanish orthography entails completely regular spelling to sound correspondences, so reading disorders may be different to English. In the current study, reading, phonological and semantic abilities of 35 patients with the three variants of PPA, and 13 Healthy_HP volunteers were assessed. Brain metabolism was concomitantly obtained from each participant using

Shared and differentiated motor skill impairments in children with Dyslexia_HP and/or Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_HP: From simple to complex sequential coordination.Dyslexia_HP and Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_HP (AD) are prevalent neurodevelopmental conditions in children and adolescents. They have high comorbidity rates and have both been associated with motor difficulties. Little is known, however, about what is shared or differentiated in Dyslexia_HP and AD in terms of motor abilities. Even when motor skill problems are identified, few studies have used the same measurement tools, resulting in inconstant findings. The present study assessed increasingly complex Gross_Motor_Skills_ASDPTO in children and adolescents with Dyslexia_HP, AD, and with both Dyslexia_HP and AD. Our results suggest normal performance on simple motor-speed tests, whereas all three groups share a common impairment on unimanual and bimanual sequential motor tasks. Children in these groups generally improve with practice to the same level as normal subjects, though they make more errors. In addition, children with AD are the most impaired on complex bimanual out-of-phase movements and with manual dexterity. These latter findings are examined in light of the Multiple Deficit Model.

Training on Movement Figure-Ground Discrimination Remediates Low-Level Visual Timing Deficits in the Dorsal Stream, Improving High-Level Cognitive Functioning, Including Attention, Reading Fluency, and Working_Memory_ASDPTO.The purpose of this study was to determine whether neurotraining to discriminate a moving test pattern relative to a Nonprogressive_HP background, figure-ground discrimination, improves vision and cognitive functioning in dyslexics, as well as typically-developing normal students. We predict that improving the speed and sensitivity of figure-ground movement discrimination (

Novel reading index for identifying disordered reading skill development: A preliminary study.Children with ADHD are at high risk of developing a Dyslexia_HP (RD), although the reasons remain unclear. ADHD-associated impairments, including processing speed, can complicate clinical evaluation for a co-occurring RD Diagnosis_ASDPTO. We propose a novel metric to (a) assess reading development and (b) provide an alternative method to classifying readers that may aid investigations for etiologies of RD in ADHD. Specifically, as both phonological decoding and word recognition skills are important precursors of reading fluency, we propose a new quantitative method comparing these skills after accounting for variations in perception, motor response, or processing speeds. Forty boys (14 control, 15 ADHD, 11 ADHD/ + RD) completed a lexical decision task testing decoding and another assessing word recognition. Response time data was modeled using a Drift Diffusion approach to estimate the underlying reading skills. Using these reading skill estimates, we calculated a novel Reading Tendency Index and classified participants into three reading groups (Decoders, Balanced Readers, and Sight Readers). The reading and cognitive performance of these groups were consistent with theoretical predictions and subsequently provided external validity for the novel Reading Tendency Index classification. Our findings demonstrate a potential classification tool for readers based on individual's developed, reading tendencies.

Reading Disorders: Pro-Eating Disorder Rhetoric and Anorexia_HP Life-Writing.This article explores the relationship between eating disorders and reading behaviors, arguing that there is a meaningful difference in a minority of readers' approach to and understanding of Anorexia_HP life-writing, and of literary texts more broadly. To illuminate this distinction, this article begins by considering the reported deleterious influence of Marya Hornbacher's Anorexia_HP memoir, Wasted, elaborating the ways Hornbacher offers a positive presentation of Anorexia_HP nervosa that may, intentionally or not, induce certain readers to "try it" themselves. This is followed by an exploration of how Hornbacher's own reading praxis is implicated in a discursive feedback loop around Anorexia_HP narratives. It concludes with a discussion of disordered reading attitudes in relation to the emergence of the "pro-Anorexia_HP" phenomenon.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to improve naming ability in post-Stroke_HP Aphasia_HP: A critical review.Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation tool that can be used to influence cortical brain activity to induce measurable Behavioral_abnormality_HP. Although there is growing evidence that tDCS combined with behavioural language therapy could boost language recovery in patients with post-Stroke_HP Aphasia_HP, there is great variability in patient characteristics, treatment protocols, and outcome measures in these studies that poses challenges for analyzing the evidence. The purpose of this study is to critically analyze the methodological rigor of the evidence regarding the use of tDCS for post-Stroke_HP Anomia_HP.

Auditory processing deficits are sometimes necessary and sometimes sufficient for language difficulties in children: Evidence from Mild_HP to Moderate_HP Sensorineural_hearing_impairment_HP.There is a general consensus that many children and adults with Dyslexia_HP and/or specific Language_impairment_HP display deficits in auditory processing. However, how these deficits are related to developmental disorders of language is uncertain, and at least four categories of model have been proposed: single Distal_HP cause models, risk factor models, association models, and consequence models. This study used children with Mild_HP to Moderate_HP Sensorineural_hearing_impairment_HP (MMHL) to investigate the link between auditory processing deficits and language disorders. We examined the auditory processing and language skills of 46, 8-16year-old children with MMHL and 44 age-matched typically developing controls. Auditory processing abilities were assessed using child-friendly psychophysical techniques in order to obtain discrimination thresholds. Stimuli incorporated three different timescales (µs, ms, s) and three different levels of complexity (simple nonspeech tones, complex nonspeech sounds, speech sounds), and tasks required discrimination of Frequency_HP or amplitude cues. Language abilities were assessed using a battery of standardised assessments of phonological processing, reading, vocabulary, and grammar. We found evidence that three different auditory processing abilities showed different relationships with language: Deficits in a general auditory processing component were necessary but not sufficient for language difficulties, and were consistent with a risk factor model; Deficits in slow-rate amplitude modulation (envelope) detection were sufficient but not necessary for language difficulties, and were consistent with either a single Distal_HP cause or a consequence model; And deficits in the discrimination of a single speech contrast (/bɑ/ vs /dɑ/) were neither necessary nor sufficient for language difficulties, and were consistent with an association model. Our findings suggest that different auditory processing deficits may constitute distinct and independent routes to the development of language difficulties in children.

Intellectual_disability_HP and Language_impairment_HP.Intellectual_disability_HP (ID) and language disorders are neurodevelopmental conditions arising in early childhood. Child psychiatrists are likely to encounter children with ID and language disorders because both are strongly associated with challenging behaviors and mental disorder. Because early intervention is associated with optimal outcomes, child psychiatrists must be aware of their signs and symptoms, particularly as related to delays in cognitive and adaptive function. Optimal management of both ID and language disorders requires a multidisciplinary, team-based, and family centered approach. Child psychiatrists play an important role on this team, given their expertise with contextualizing and treating challenging behaviors.

[Computerized oculomotor training in Dyslexia_HP: A randomized, crossover clinical trial in pediatric population].Several studies have reported abnormal oculomotor capacities leading to reading/writing difficulties among dyslexic children. However, no randomized clinical trial has been conducted to determine whether oculomotor training improves reading/writing skills of these children. The present study aims to evaluate the efficacy of computer-based oculomotor training among dyslexic children.

Reading and lexical-decision tasks generate different patterns of individual variability as a function of condition difficulty.We reanalyzed previous experiments based on lexical-decision and reading-aloud tasks in children with Dyslexia_HP and control children and tested the prediction of the difference engine model (DEM) that mean condition reaction times (RTs) and standard deviations (SDs) would be linearly related (Myerson et al., 2003). Then we evaluated the slope and the intercept with the x-axis of these linear functions in comparison with previously reported values (i.e., slope of about 0.30 and intercept of about 300 ms). In the case of lexical decision, the parameters were close to these values; by contrast, in the case of reading aloud, a much steeper slope (0.66) and a greater intercept (482.6 ms) were found. Therefore, interindividual variability grows at a much faster rate as a function of condition difficulty for reading than for lexical-decision tasks (or for other tasks reported in the literature). According to the DEM, the slope of the regression that relates means and SDs indicates the degree of correlation among the durations of the stages of processing. We propose that the need for a close coupling between orthographic and phonological processing in reading is what drives the particularly strong relationship between performance and interindividual variability that we observed in reading tasks.

Foreign language reading and spelling in gifted students with Dyslexia_HP in secondary education.A few studies suggest that gifted children with Dyslexia_HP have better literacy skills than averagely intelligent children with Dyslexia_HP. This finding aligns with the hypothesis that giftedness-related factors provide compensation for poor reading. The present study investigated whether, as in the native language (NL), the level of foreign language (FL) literacy of gifted students with Dyslexia_HP is higher than the literacy level of averagely intelligent students with Dyslexia_HP and whether this difference can be accounted for by the difference in their NL literacy level. The sample consisted of 148 Dutch native speaking secondary school students divided in four groups: Dyslexia_HP, gifted/Dyslexia_HP, typically developing (TD), and gifted. All students were assessed on word reading and orthographic knowledge in Dutch and English when they were in 7th or 8th grade. A subsample (

Unfolding the genetic pathways of Dyslexia_HP in Asian population: A review.Dyslexia_HP also known as specific reading disorder is a complex heritable disorder with unexpected difficulty in learning to read and spell despite adequate intelligence, education, environment, and normal senses. Over past decades, researchers have attempted to characterize Dyslexia_HP neurobiological and genetic levels and unfold its pathophysiology. The genetic research on Dyslexia_HP has received attention in Asia from the last decade. Though limited by different constraints the studies from Asia have been able to gather significant evidence in this field. We present a review of studies of genetics in Asian population and suggest future directions.

Predicting Individual Differences in Reading and Spelling Skill With Artificial Script-Based Letter-Speech Sound Training.In this study, we examined the learning of letter-speech sound correspondences within an artificial script and performed an experimental analysis of letter-speech sound learning among dyslexic and normal readers vis-à-vis phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming, reading, and spelling. Participants were provided with 20 min of training aimed at learning eight new basic letter-speech sound correspondences, followed by a short assessment of mastery of the correspondences and word-reading ability in this unfamiliar script. Our results demonstrated that brief training is moderately successful in differentiating dyslexic readers from normal readers in their ability to learn letter-speech sound correspondences. The normal readers outperformed the dyslexic readers for accuracy and speed on a letter-speech sound matching task, as well as on a word-reading task containing familiar words written in the artificial orthography. Importantly, the new artificial script-related measures were related to phonological awareness and rapid automatized naming and made a unique contribution in predicting individual differences in reading and spelling ability. Our results are consistent with the view that a fundamental letter-speech sound learning deficit is a key factor in Dyslexia_HP.

Complex phenotypes associated with STIM1 mutations in both coiled coil and EF-hand domains.Dominant mutations in STIM1 are a cause of three allelic conditions: tubular aggregate Myopathy_HP, Stormorken syndrome (a complex phenotype including Myopathy_HP, hyposplenism, Hypocalcemia_HP and Abnormal_bleeding_HP), and a platelet dysfunction disorder, York platelet syndrome. Previous reports have suggested a genotype-phenotype correlation with mutations in the N-terminal EF-hand domain associated with tubular aggregate Myopathy_HP, and a common mutation at p.R304W in a coiled coil domain associated with Stormorken syndrome. In this study individuals with STIM1 variants were identified by exome sequencing or STIM1 direct sequencing, and assessed for neuromuscular, haematological and biochemical evidence of the allelic disorders of STIM1. STIM1 mutations were investigated by fibroblast calcium imaging and 3D modelling. Six individuals with STIM1 mutations, including two novel mutations (c.262A>G (p.S88G) and c.911G>A (p.R304Q)), were identified. Extra-neuromuscular symptoms including Thrombocytopenia_HP, platelet dysfunction, Hypocalcemia_HP or hyposplenism were present in 5/6 patients with mutations in both the EF-hand and CC domains. 3/6 patients had Behavioral_abnormality_HP, not previously reported in STIM1 disease. Review of published STIM1 patients (n = 49) confirmed that neuromuscular symptoms are present in most patients. We conclude that the phenotype associated with activating STIM1 mutations frequently includes extra-neuromuscular features such as Hypocalcemia_HP, hypo-/Asplenia_HP and platelet dysfunction regardless of mutation domain.

Atypical perceptual processing of faces in developmental Dyslexia_HP.Developmental Dyslexia_HP (DD) is often attributed to phonological processing deficits. Recent evidence, however, indicates the need for a more general explanatory framework to account for DD's range of deficits. The current study examined the specificity versus domain generality of DD by comparing the recognition and discrimination of three visual categories (faces and words with cars as control stimuli) in typical and dyslexic readers. Relative to controls, not only did dyslexic individuals perform more poorly on word recognition, but they also matched faces more slowly, especially when the faces differed in viewpoint, and discriminated between similar faces (but not cars) more poorly. Additionally, dyslexics showed reduced hemispheric lateralization for words and faces. These results reveal that DD affects both word and face, but not car, processing, implicating a partial domain general basis of DD. We offer a theoretical proposal to account for the multifaceted findings and suggestions for further, longitudinal studies.

Early Identification of Reading Difficulties: A Screening Strategy that Adjusts the Sensitivity to the Level of Prediction Accuracy.Early screening for reading difficulties before the Onset_HP of instruction is desirable because it allows intervention that is targeted at prevention rather than remediation of reading difficulties. However, early screening may be too inaccurate to effectively allocate resources to those who need them. The present study compared the accuracy of early screening before the Onset_HP of formal reading instruction with late screening six months into the first year of instruction. The study followed 164 Danish students from the end of Grade 0 to the end of Grade 2. Early screening included measures of phonemic awareness, rapid naming, letter knowledge, paired associate learning, and reading. Late screening included only reading. Results indicated that reading measures improved substantially as predictors over the first six months of Grade 1, to the point where late reading measures alone provided as much information as the early measures combined. In the light of these results and a less than perfect early screening accuracy, a new strategy for screening is introduced and discussed. The strategy proposes multi-point screening with gradually increasing sensitivity to strike a balance between manageable screening procedures and outcomes and early identification of students who are most likely in need of extra resources.

Postural Control in Children with Dyslexia_HP: Effects of Emotional Stimuli in a Dual-Task Environment.The aim of this study was to compare the visual exploration strategies used during a postural control task across participants with and without Dyslexia_HP. We simultaneously recorded eye movements and postural control while children were viewing different types of emotional faces. Twenty-two children with Dyslexia_HP and twenty-two aged-matched children without Dyslexia_HP participated in the study. We analysed the surface area, the length and the mean velocity of the centre of pressure for balance in parallel with visual saccadic latency, the number of saccades and the time spent in regions of interest. Our results showed that postural stability in children with Dyslexia_HP was weaker and the surface area of their centre of pressure increased significantly when they viewed an unpleasant face. Moreover, children with Dyslexia_HP had different strategies to those used by children without Dyslexia_HP during visual exploration, and in particular when they viewed unpleasant emotional faces. We suggest that lower performance in emotional face processing in children with Dyslexia_HP could be due to a difference in their visual strategies, linked to their identification of unpleasant emotional faces.

Pure and Short-Term Phonics-Training Improves Reading and Print-Specific ERP in English: A Case Study of a Japanese Middle School Girl.Although phonics is the most frequently used approach in treating students with reading difficulties, its effects have not been fully clarified at either a behavioral or neurophysiological level. The present case study administered pure and short-term (i.e., 10 minutes per day for five weeks) phonics-training to a 13-year-old Japanese girl with Severe_HP difficulty in learning English. As a result, a drastic improvement in reading accuracy was associated with the enhancement of print-specific N170 in event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by the trained words. The present finding indicates that phonics training can, by itself, remediate English reading and Affect_ASDPTO its neurophysiological bases.

Discriminant validity of spatial and temporal postural index in children with neurodevelopmental disorders.Autism_HP, learning disabilities and Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_HP/hyperactive disorder are often comorbid disorders. In order to try and find some markers that might be transnosographic, we hypothesized that abnormal postural sway profiles may discriminate children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) from typically developing children. The aim of our study was thus to compare spatial and temporal measures of the Center of Pressure in three distinct groups of children with NDDs (high functioning Autism_HP spectrum disorders, learning disabilities (Dyslexia_HP) and Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_HP/hyperactive disorders) and in typically developing children. Postural performances were thus evaluated in 92 children (23 per group, sex-, age- and IQ-matched groups) by using the Multitest Equilibre platform (Framiral

Visuo-spatial cueing in children with differential reading and spelling profiles.Dyslexia_HP has been claimed to be causally related to deficits in visuo-spatial attention. In particular, inefficient shifting of visual attention during spatial cueing paradigms is assumed to be associated with problems in graphemic parsing during sublexical reading. The current study investigated visuo-spatial attention performance in an exogenous cueing paradigm in a large sample (N = 191) of third and fourth graders with different reading and spelling profiles (controls, isolated reading deficit, isolated spelling deficit, combined deficit in reading and spelling). Once individual variability in reaction times was taken into account by means of z-transformation, a cueing deficit (i.e. no significant difference between valid and invalid trials) was found for children with combined deficits in reading and spelling. However, poor readers without spelling problems showed a cueing effect comparable to controls, but exhibited a particularly strong Right_HP-over-Left_HP advantage (Position_HP effect). Isolated poor spellers showed a significant cueing effect, but no Position_HP effect. While we replicated earlier findings of a reduced cueing effect among poor nonword readers (indicating deficits in sublexical processing), we also found a reduced cueing effect among children with particularly poor orthographic spelling (indicating deficits in lexical processing). Thus, earlier claims of a specific association with nonword reading could not be confirmed. Controlling for ADHD-symptoms reported in a parental questionnaire did not impact on the statistical analysis, indicating that cueing deficits are not caused by more general attentional limitations. Between 31 and 48% of participants in the three reading and/or spelling deficit groups as well as 32% of the control group showed reduced spatial cueing. These findings indicate a significant, but Moderate_HP association between certain aspects of visuo-spatial attention and subcomponents of written language processing, the causal status of which is yet unclear.

Thus, earlier claims of a specific association with nonword reading could not be confirmed. Controlling for ADHD-symptoms reported in a parental questionnaire did not impact on the statistical analysis, indicating that cueing deficits are not caused by more general attentional limitations. Between 31 and 48% of participants in the three reading and/or spelling deficit groups as well as 32% of the control group showed reduced spatial cueing. These findings indicate a significant, but moderate association between certain aspects of visuo-spatial attention and subcomponents of written language processing, the causal status of which is yet unclear.
Visuo-spatial cueing in children with differential reading and spelling profiles.Dyslexia has been claimed to be causally related to deficits in visuo-spatial attention. In particular, inefficient shifting of visual attention during spatial cueing paradigms is assumed to be associated with problems in graphemic parsing during sublexical reading. The current study investigated visuo-spatial attention performance in an exogenous cueing paradigm in a large sample (N = 191) of third and fourth graders with different reading and spelling profiles (controls, isolated reading deficit, isolated spelling deficit, combined deficit in reading and spelling). Once individual variability in reaction times was taken into account by means of z-transformation, a cueing deficit (i.e. no significant difference between valid and invalid trials) was found for children with combined deficits in reading and spelling. However, poor readers without spelling problems showed a cueing effect comparable to controls, but exhibited a particularly strong right-over-left advantage (position effect). Isolated poor spellers showed a significant cueing effect, but no position effect. While we replicated earlier findings of a reduced cueing effect among poor nonword readers (indicating deficits in sublexical processing), we also found a reduced cueing effect among children with particularly poor orthographic spelling (indicating deficits in lexical processing). Thus, earlier claims of a specific association with nonword reading could not be confirmed.

A longitudinal study investigating neural processing of speech envelope modulation rates in children with (a family risk for) Dyslexia_HP.Recent evidence suggests that a fundamental deficit in the synchronization of neural oscillations to temporal information in speech may underlie phonological processing problems in Dyslexia_HP. Since previous studies were performed cross-sectionally in school-aged children or adults, developmental aspects of neural auditory processing in relation to reading acquisition and Dyslexia_HP remain to be investigated. The present longitudinal study followed 68 children during development from pre-reader (5 years old) to beginning reader (7 years old) and more advanced reader (9 years old). Thirty-six children had a family risk for Dyslexia_HP and 14 children eventually developed Dyslexia_HP. EEG recordings of auditory steady-state responses to 4 and 20 Hz modulations, corresponding to syllable and phoneme rates, were collected at each point in time. Our results demonstrate an increase in neural synchronization to phoneme-rate modulations around the Onset_HP of reading acquisition. This effect was negatively correlated with later reading and phonological skills, indicating that children who exhibit the largest increase in neural synchronization to phoneme rates, develop the poorest reading and phonological skills. Accordingly, neural synchronization to phoneme-rate modulations was found to be significantly higher in beginning and more advanced readers with Dyslexia_HP. We found no developmental effects regarding neural synchronization to syllable rates, nor any effects of a family risk for Dyslexia_HP. Altogether, our findings suggest that the Onset_HP of reading instruction coincides with an increase in neural responsiveness to phoneme-rate modulations, and that the extent of this increase is related to (the outcome of) reading development. Hereby, dyslexic children persistently demonstrate atypically high neural synchronization to phoneme rates from the beginning of reading acquisition onwards.

Reading deficits in Schizophrenia_HP and their relationship to developmental Dyslexia_HP: A review.Although Schizophrenia_HP and developmental Dyslexia_HP are considered distinct disorders in terms of clinical presentation and functional outcome, they both involve disruption in the processes that support skilled reading, including language, auditory perception, Visual_Perception_ASDPTO, oculomotor control, and Executive_Function_ASDPTO. Further, recent work has proposed a common neurodevelopmental basis for the two disorders, as suggested by genetic and pathophysiological overlap. Thus, these lines of research suggest that reading may be similarly impacted in Schizophrenia_HP and Dyslexia_HP. In this review, we survey research on reading abilities in individuals with Schizophrenia_HP, and review the potential mechanisms underlying reading deficits in Schizophrenia_HP that may be shared with those implicated in Dyslexia_HP. Elucidating the relationship between reading impairment in Schizophrenia_HP and Dyslexia_HP could allow for a better understanding of the pathophysiological underpinnings of Schizophrenia_HP, and could facilitate remediation of Cognitive_impairment_HP that impact day-to-day functioning.

Alexia_HP Without Agraphia: A Rare Entity.Pure Alexia_HP refers to an acquired disorder associated with the damage to medial occipitotemporal gyrus in the dominant hemisphere, which is also known as visual word form area (VWFA). VWFA is involved in rapid word recognition and fluent reading. Alexia_HP without agraphia is a disconnection syndrome that occurs when the splenium is also damaged with the occipital lobe on a dominant side. We report a case of a 72-year-old Right_HP-handed male who presented with Alexia_HP without agraphia accompanied by Right_HP Homonymous_Hemianopia_HP resulting from Acute_HP infarct of the Left_HP occipital lobe, the splenium of the corpus callosum and posterior thalamus that probably occurred on the previous day. During the evaluation, he exhibited marked impairment in the ability to read with the vision being grossly normal. Magnetic resonant imaging (MRI) revealed an Acute_HP infarct of the Left_HP occipital lobe, the splenium of the corpus callosum and posterior thalamus. A computerized tomography angiogram (CTA) revealed Left_HP posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory infarct without any evidence of hemorrhagic conversion. Infarction of the occipital lobe on the dominant side (Left_HP) in a Right_HP-handed individual may cause a disruption in the visual word form area and is manifested by an inability to read with no abnormalities in visual acuity.

Exploring the Link between Visual_Perception_ASDPTO, Visual-Motor Integration, and Reading in Normal Developing and Impaired Children using DTVP-2.Reading is known to be primarily a linguistic task. However, to successfully decode written words, children also need to develop good visual-perception skills. Furthermore, Motor_Skills_ASDPTO are implicated in letter recognition and reading acquisition. Three studies have been designed to determine the link between reading, Visual_Perception_ASDPTO, and visual-motor integration using the Developmental Test of Visual_Perception_ASDPTO version 2 (DTVP-2). Study 1 tests how Visual_Perception_ASDPTO and visual-motor integration in kindergarten predict reading outcomes in Grade 1, in typical developing children. Study 2 is aimed at finding out if these skills can be seen as clinical markers in dyslexic children (DD). Study 3 determines if visual-motor integration and motor-reduced Visual_Perception_ASDPTO can distinguish DD children according to whether they exhibit or not developmental coordination disorder (DCD). Results showed that phonological awareness and visual-motor integration predicted reading outcomes one year later. DTVP-2 demonstrated similarities and differences in visual-motor integration and motor-reduced Visual_Perception_ASDPTO between children with DD, DCD, and both of these deficits. DTVP-2 is a suitable tool to investigate links between Visual_Perception_ASDPTO, visual-motor integration and reading, and to differentiate cognitive profiles of children with developmental disabilities (i.e. DD, DCD, and comorbid children).

Response to Intervention as a Predictor of Long-Term Reading Outcomes in Children with Dyslexia_HP.The goal of this study was to investigate how growth during a phonics-based intervention, as well as reading levels at baseline testing, predicted long-term reading outcomes of children with Dyslexia_HP. Eighty Dutch children with Dyslexia_HP who had completed a 50-week phonics-based intervention in grade 4 were tested in grade 5 on both word and pseudoword (following regular Dutch orthographic patterns) reading efficiency and compared to 93 typical readers. In grade 5 the children with Dyslexia_HP were still significantly slower in word and pseudoword reading than their typically developing peers. Results showed that long-term pseudoword reading in the group with Dyslexia_HP was predicted by pseudoword reading at pretest and growth in pseudoword reading during the intervention, which was itself predicted by pseudoword reading at pretest. This was not the case for word reading. We found that long-term word reading was directly predicted from pretest word reading, and indirectly via pretest pseudoword reading, via growth in pseudoword and word reading. It can be concluded that pseudoword reading is not only a good indicator of Severity_HP of reading difficulties in children with Dyslexia_HP, it is also an indicator of who will profit from intervention in the long-term.

What Dyslexia_HP? Evidence for Multiple Latent Profiles of Struggling Readers in a Large Russian Sibpair Sample With at Least One Sibling at Risk for Reading Difficulties.In this study, we performed a latent profile analysis of reading and related skills in a large ( n = 733) sibpair sample of Russian readers at risk for reading difficulties. The analysis suggested the presence of seven latent profiles, of which two were characterized by relatively high performance on measures of spelling and reading comprehension and the remaining five included severely as well as moderately Affected_HP readers with deficits in the domains of phonological, orthographic, and morphological processing. The results suggest that the development and manifestation of reading difficulties in Russian is mappable on a complex pattern of interactions between different types and severities of processing deficits. The results point to the psychological reality of multiple different suboptimal patterns of deficits in reading and reading-related skills and support the multifactorial view of the disorder, with intriguing implications for future neurobiological studies.

Reading related white matter structures in adolescents are influenced more by dysregulation of emotion than behavior.Mood_ASDPTO_Disorders_ASDPTO and behavioral are broad psychiatric diagnostic categories that have different symptoms and neurobiological mechanisms, but share some neurocognitive similarities, one of which is an elevated risk for reading deficit. Our aim was to determine the influence of Mood_ASDPTO versus behavioral dysregulation on reading ability and neural correlates supporting these skills in youth, using diffusion tensor imaging in 11- to 17-year-old children and youths with Mood_ASDPTO_Disorders_ASDPTO or Behavioral_abnormality_HP and age-matched Healthy_HP controls. The three groups differed only in phonological processing and passage comprehension. Youth with Mood_ASDPTO_Disorders_ASDPTO scored higher on the phonological test but had lower comprehension scores than children with Behavioral_abnormality_HP and controls; control participants scored the highest. Correlations between fractional anisotropy and phonological processing in the Left_HP Arcuate Fasciculus showed a significant difference between groups and were strongest in Behavioral_abnormality_HP, intermediate in Mood_ASDPTO_Disorders_ASDPTO, and lowest in controls. Correlations between these measures in the Left_HP Inferior Longitudinal Fasciculus were significantly greater than in controls for Mood_ASDPTO but not for Behavioral_abnormality_HP. Youth with Mood_ASDPTO_Disorders_ASDPTO share a deficit in the executive-limbic pathway (Arcuate Fasciculus) with behavioral-disordered youth, suggesting reduced capacity for engaging frontal regions for phonological processing or passage comprehension tasks and increased reliance on the ventral tract (e.g., the Inferior Longitudinal Fasciculus). The low passage comprehension scores in Mood_ASDPTO disorder may result from engaging the Left_HP hemisphere. Neural pathways for reading differ mainly in executive-limbic circuitry. This new insight may aid clinicians in providing appropriate intervention for each disorder.

Developmental surface and phonological Dyslexia_HP in both Greek and English.The hallmark of developmental surface Dyslexia_HP in English and French is inaccurate reading of words with atypical spelling-sound correspondences. According to Douklias, Masterson and Hanley (2009), surface Dyslexia_HP can also be observed in Greek (a transparent orthography for reading that does not contain words of this kind). Their findings suggested that surface Dyslexia_HP in Greek can be characterized by slow reading of familiar words, and by inaccurate spelling of words with atypical sound-spelling correspondences (Greek is less transparent for spelling than for reading). In this study, we report seven adult cases whose slow reading and impaired spelling accuracy satisfied these criteria for Greek surface Dyslexia_HP. When asked to read words with atypical grapheme-phoneme correspondences in English (their second language), their accuracy was severely impaired. A co-occurrence was also observed between impaired spelling of words with atypical phoneme-grapheme correspondences in English and Greek. These co-occurrences provide strong evidence that surface Dyslexia_HP genuinely exists in Greek and that slow reading of real words in Greek reflects the same underlying impairment as that which produces inaccurate reading of atypical words in English. Two further individuals were observed with impaired reading and spelling of nonwords in both languages, consistent with developmental phonological Dyslexia_HP. Neither of the phonological dyslexics read words slowly. In terms of computational models of reading aloud, these findings suggest that slow reading by dyslexics in transparent orthographies is the consequence of a developmental impairment of the lexical (Coltheart, Rastle, Perry, Langdon, & Zeigler, 2001; Perry, Ziegler, & Zorzi, 2010) or semantic reading route (Plaut, McClelland, Seidenberg, & Patterson, 1996). This outcome provides evidence that the neurophysiological substrate(s) that support the lexical/semantic and the phonological pathways that are involved in reading and spelling are the same in both Greek and English.

Procedural learning in Parkinson's disease, specific Language_impairment_HP, Dyslexia_HP, Schizophrenia_HP, developmental coordination disorder, and Autistic_behavior_HP: A second-order meta-analysis.The serial reaction time task (SRTT) has been used to study procedural learning in clinical populations. In this report, second-order meta-analysis was used to investigate whether disorder type moderates performance on the SRTT. Using this approach to quantitatively summarise past research, it was tested whether Autistic_behavior_HP, developmental coordination disorder, Dyslexia_HP, Parkinson's disease, Schizophrenia_HP, and specific Language_impairment_HP differentially Affect_ASDPTO procedural learning on the SRTT. The main analysis revealed disorder type moderated SRTT performance (p=0.010). This report demonstrates comparable levels of procedural learning impairment in developmental coordination disorder, Dyslexia_HP, Parkinson's disease, Schizophrenia_HP, and specific Language_impairment_HP. However, in Autism_HP, procedural learning is spared.

Cortical responses to tone and phoneme mismatch as a predictor of Dyslexia_HP? A systematic review.Evidence from event-related-potential (ERP) studies has repeatedly shown differences in the perception and processing of auditory stimuli in children with Dyslexia_HP compared to control children. The mismatch negativity (MMN) - an ERP component reflecting passive auditory change detection ability - has been found to be reduced, not only in children with a Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Dyslexia_HP, but also in infants and preschool children at risk of developing Dyslexia_HP. However, the results are controversial due to the different methods, age of the children and stimuli used. The aim of the present review is to summarize and evaluate the MMN research about at-risk children in order to identify risk factors that discriminate between children with and without Dyslexia_HP risk and to analyze if the MMR (the abbreviation refers to positive and negative mismatch responses) correlates with later reading and spelling ability. A literature search yielded 17 studies reporting MMR to speech or non-speech stimuli in children at risk of Dyslexia_HP. The results of the studies were inconsistent. Studies measuring speech MMR often found attenuated amplitudes in the at-risk group, but mainly in very young children. The results for older children (6-7years) and for non-speech stimuli are more Heterogeneous_HP A Moderate_HP positive correlation of MMR amplitude size with later reading and spelling abilities was consistently found. Overall, the findings of this review indicate that the MMR can be a valuable part of early Dyslexia_HP identification, which can enable efficient support and intervention for a child before the first problems appear.

Reading network in Dyslexia_HP: Similar, yet different.Dyslexia_HP is a developmental disorder characterized by reading and phonological difficulties, yet important questions remain regarding its underlying neural correlates. In this study, we used partial least squares (PLS), a multivariate analytic technique, to investigate the neural networks used by dyslexics while performing a word-rhyming task. Although the overall reading network was largely similar in dyslexics and typical readers, it did not correlate with behavior in the same way in the two groups. In particular, there was a positive association between reading performance and both Right_HP superior temporal gyrus and Bilateral_HP insula activation in dyslexic readers but a negative correlation in typical readers. Together with differences in lateralization unique to dyslexics, this suggests that the combination of poor reading performance with high insula activity and atypical Laterality_HP is a consistent marker of Dyslexia_HP. These findings emphasize the importance of understanding Right_HP-hemisphere activation in Dyslexia_HP and provide promising directions for the remediation of reading disorders.

In this study, we used partial least squares (PLS), a multivariate analytic technique, to investigate the neural networks used by dyslexics while performing a word-rhyming task. Although the overall reading network was largely similar in dyslexics and typical readers, it did not correlate with behavior in the same way in the two groups. In particular, there was a positive association between reading performance and both right superior temporal gyrus and bilateral insula activation in dyslexic readers but a negative correlation in typical readers. Together with differences in lateralization unique to dyslexics, this suggests that the combination of poor reading performance with high insula activity and atypical laterality is a consistent marker of dyslexia. These findings emphasize the importance of understanding right-hemisphere activation in dyslexia and provide promising directions for the remediation of reading disorders.

Neural stability: A reflection of automaticity in reading.Automaticity, the ability to perform a task rapidly with minimal effort, plays a key role in reading fluency and is indexed by rapid automatized naming (RAN) and processing speed. Yet little is known about automaticity's neurophysiologic underpinnings. The more efficiently sound is encoded, the more automatic sound processing can be. In turn, this automaticity could free up cognitive resources such as attention and Working_Memory_ASDPTO to help build an integrative reading network. Therefore, we hypothesized that automaticity and reading fluency correlate with Stable_HP neural representation of sounds, given a larger body of literature suggesting the close relationship between neural stability and the integrative function in the Central_HP auditory system. To test this hypothesis, we recorded the Frequency_HP-following responses (FFR) to speech syllables and administered cognitive and reading measures to school-aged children. We show that the stability of neural responses to speech correlates with RAN and processing speed, but not phonological awareness. Moreover, the link between neural stability and RAN mediates the previously-determined link between neural stability and reading ability. Children with a RAN deficit have especially unStable_HP neural responses. Our neurophysiological approach illuminates a potential neural mechanism specific to RAN, which in turn indicates a relationship between synchronous neural firing in the auditory system and automaticity critical for reading fluency.

The DCDC2 deletion is not a risk factor for Dyslexia_HP.Dyslexia_HP is a specific impairment in learning to read and has strong heritability. An intronic deletion within the DCDC2 gene, with ~8% Frequency_HP in European populations, is increasingly used as a marker for Dyslexia_HP in neuroimaging and behavioral studies. At a mechanistic level, this deletion has been proposed to influence sensory processing capacity, and in particular sensitivity to visual coherent motion. Our re-assessment of the literature, however, did not reveal strong support for a role of this specific deletion in Dyslexia_HP. We also analyzed data from five distinct cohorts, enriched for individuals with Dyslexia_HP, and did not identify any signal indicative of associations for the DCDC2 deletion with reading-related measures, including in a combined sample analysis (N=526). We believe we conducted the first replication analysis for a proposed deletion effect on visual motion perception and found no association (N=445 siblings). We also report that the DCDC2 deletion has a Frequency_HP of 37.6% in a cohort representative of the general population recruited in Hong Kong (N=220). This figure, together with a lack of association between the deletion and reading abilities in this cohort, indicates the low likelihood of a direct deletion effect on reading skills. Therefore, on the basis of multiple strands of evidence, we conclude that the DCDC2 deletion is not a strong risk factor for Dyslexia_HP. Our analyses and literature re-evaluation are important for interpreting current developments within multidisciplinary studies of Dyslexia_HP and, more generally, contribute to current discussions about the importance of reproducibility in science.

Slowing in reading and picture naming: the effects of aging and developmental Dyslexia_HP.We examined the slowing in vocal reaction times shown by dyslexic (compared to control) children with that of older (compared to younger) adults using an approach focusing on the detection of global, non-task-specific components. To address this aim, data were analyzed with reference to the difference engine (DEM) and rate and amount (RAM) models. In Experiment 1, typically developing children, children with Dyslexia_HP (both attending sixth grade), younger adults and older adults read words and non-words and named pictures. In Experiment 2, word and picture conditions were presented to dyslexic and control children attending eighth grade. In both experiments, dyslexic children were delayed in reading conditions, while they were unimpaired in naming pictures (a finding which indicates spared access to the phonological lexicon). The reading difficulty was well accounted for by a single multiplicative factor while only the residual effect of length (but not Frequency_HP and lexicality) was present after controlling for over-additivity using a linear mixed effects model with random slopes on critical variables. Older adults were slower than younger adults across reading and naming conditions. This deficit was well described by a single multiplicative factor. Thus, while slowing of information processing is limited to orthographic stimuli in dyslexic children, it cuts across verbal tasks in older adults. Overall, speed differences in groups such as dyslexic children and older adults can be effectively described with reference to deficits in domains encompassing a variety of experimental conditions rather than deficits in single specific task/conditions. The DEM and RAM prove effective in teasing out global vs. specific components of performance.

A Three-Year Longitudinal Study of Reading and Spelling Difficulty in Chinese Developmental Dyslexia_HP: The Matter of Morphological Awareness.In the present study, we used a three-time point longitudinal design to investigate the associations of morphological awareness to word reading and spelling in a small group of those with and without Dyslexia_HP taken from a larger sample of 164 Hong Kong Chinese children who remained in a longitudinal study across ages 6, 7 and 8. Among those 164 children, 15 had been diagnosed as having Dyslexia_HP by professional psychologists, and 15 other children manifested average reading ability and had been randomly selected from the sample for comparison. All children were administered a battery of tasks including Chinese character recognition, word dictation, morphological awareness, phonological awareness and rapid automatized naming. Multivariate analysis of variance and predictive discriminate analysis were performed to examine whether the dyslexic children showed differences in the cognitive-linguistic tasks in comparison with controls. Results suggested that the dyslexic groups had poorer performance in morphological awareness and RAN across all 3 years. However, phonological awareness was not Stable_HP in distinguishing the groups. Findings suggest that morphological awareness is a relatively strong correlate of spelling difficulties in Chinese, but phonological awareness is not. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Socially Desirable Responding and College Students with Dyslexia_HP: Implications for the Assessment of Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP and Depression_ASDPTO.We investigated self-reported depressive and Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP-related symptoms among college students with Dyslexia_HP, with emphasis on the role of socially desirable responding (SDR) in understanding these reports. Analyses included examination of differences in self-reported depressive symptoms, Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP-related symptoms, and SDR. We also examined the relationships among SDR, depressive symptoms, Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP-related symptoms, and reading skills. Participants with Dyslexia_HP demonstrated significantly higher SDR than did participants without Dyslexia_HP, and higher SDR was significantly associated with lower self-reported depressive and Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP-related symptoms. Moreover, higher SDR was significantly associated with lower reading skills. There was no group difference on Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP-related symptoms, but participants with Dyslexia_HP had higher depressive symptoms than did participants without Dyslexia_HP when SDR was controlled. Implications for the assessment of Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP and Depression_ASDPTO among college students with Dyslexia_HP are discussed. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Neural Entrainment and Sensorimotor Synchronization to the Beat in Children with Developmental Dyslexia_HP: An EEG Study.Tapping in time to a metronome beat (hereafter beat synchronization) shows considerable variability in child populations, and individual differences in beat synchronization are reliably related to reading development. Children with developmental Dyslexia_HP show impairments in beat synchronization. These impairments may reflect deficiencies in auditory perception of the beat which in turn Affect_ASDPTO auditory-motor mapping, or may reflect an independent motor deficit. Here, we used a new methodology in EEG based on measuring beat-related steady-state evoked potentials (SS-EPs, Nozaradan et al., 2015) in an attempt to disentangle neural sensory and motor contributions to behavioral beat synchronization in children with Dyslexia_HP. Children tapped with both their Left_HP and Right_HP hands to every second beat of a metronome pulse delivered at 2.4 Hz, or listened passively to the beat. Analyses of preferred phase in EEG showed that the children with Dyslexia_HP had a significantly different preferred phase compared to control children in all conditions. Regarding SS-EPs, the groups differed significantly for the passive Auditory listening condition at 2.4 Hz, and showed a trend toward a difference in the Right_HP hand tapping condition at 3.6 Hz (sensorimotor integration measure). The data suggest that neural rhythmic entrainment is atypical in children with Dyslexia_HP for both an auditory beat and during sensorimotor coupling (tapping). The data are relevant to a growing literature suggesting that rhythm-based interventions may help language processing in children with developmental disorders of language learning.

Who Will Help My Son?: A Family's Journey with Dyslexia_HP.It may seem unusual for a nurse to intervene and assist a child with a learning disability, but a mental health nurse who knows the warning signs of Dyslexia_HP is able to help families who are going through a difficult time. The current article details the author's experience regarding her son's Dyslexia_HP Diagnosis_ASDPTO. For her family, a nurse was a valuable resource. The impact the struggle had not only on her son, but also her family, and the changes brought about by getting a Diagnosis_ASDPTO and treatment, demonstrate the impact that nurses can have when family-focused care is provided.

What role for prism adaptation in the rehabilitation of pure neglect Dyslexia_HP?Prism adaptation (PA) has been successfully applied in the rehabilitation of spatial neglect, with significant transfer to classic neglect tests and activities of daily living. However, well-controlled studies were unable to replicate these findings, and recent reports suggest that PA may Affect_ASDPTO selectively visuo-motor symptoms. Here, a patient with pure Left_HP neglect Dyslexia_HP was tested before, immediately after, and 24 h after PA. Despite a significant adaptation aftereffect adaptation had no effect omissions, substitutions and letter-based errors. PA does not Affect_ASDPTO pure neglect Dyslexia_HP and should therefore be reserved for the rehabilitation of motor-intentional, rather than visual-attentional symptoms.

Neurobiological bases of reading disorder Part I: Etiological investigations.While many studies have focused on identifying the neural and behavioral characteristics of decoding-based reading disorder (RD, aka developmental Dyslexia_HP), the etiology of RD remains largely unknown and understudied. Because the brain plays an intermediate role between genetic factors and behavioral outcomes, it is promising to address causality from a neural perspective. In the current, Part I of the two-part review, we discuss neuroimaging approaches to addressing the causality issue and review the results of studies that have employed these approaches. We assume that if a neural signature were associated with RD etiology, it would (a) manifest across comparisons in different languages, (b) be experience independent and appear in comparisons between RD and reading-matched controls, (c) be present both pre- and post-intervention, (d) be found in at-risk, pre-reading children and (e) be associated with genetic risk. We discuss each of these five characteristics in turn and summarize the studies that have examined each of them. The available literature provides evidence that anomalies in Left_HP temporo-parietal cortex, and possibly occipito-temporal cortex, may be closely related to the etiology of RD. Improved understanding of the etiology of RD can help improve the accuracy of early detection and enable targeted intervention of cognitive processes that are amenable to change, leading to improved outcomes in at-risk or Affected_HP populations.

Reading on the Right_HP when there's nothing Left_HP? Probabilistic tractography reveals hemispheric asymmetry in pure Alexia_HP.We present a patient with reading inexpertise and Right_HP Hemianopia_HP following Left_HP posterior cerebral artery (PCA) Stroke_HP. We examine the extent of disruption to reading performance and the extent of white matter tract damage relative to a patient with more limited PCA infarction and isolated Right_HP Hemianopia_HP. We show white matter disconnection of the temporal occipital fusiform cortex in our pure Alexia_HP patient. Connectivity-based Laterality_HP indices revealed Right_HP hemisphere Laterality_HP in the Alexia_HP patient; this was not associated with improved reading function. We speculate that the degree of premorbid Laterality_HP may be a critical factor affecting the extent of reading dysfunction in Alexia_HP.

Neuroanatomy of developmental Dyslexia_HP: Pitfalls and promise.Investigations into the neuroanatomical bases of developmental Dyslexia_HP have now spanned more than 40 years, starting with the post-mortem examination of a few individual brains in the 60s and 70s, and exploding in the 90s with the widespread use of MRI. The time is now ripe to reappraise the considerable amount of data gathered with MRI using different types of sequences (T1, diffusion, spectroscopy) and analysed using different methods (manual, voxel-based or surface-based morphometry, fractional anisotropy and tractography, multivariate analyses…). While selective reviews of mostly small-scale studies seem to provide a coherent view of the brain disruptions that are typical of Dyslexia_HP, involving Left_HP perisylvian and occipito-temporal regions, we argue that this view may be deceptive and that meta-analyses and large-scale studies rather highlight many inconsistencies and limitations. We discuss problems inherent to small sample size as well as methodological difficulties that still undermine the discovery of reliable neuroanatomical bases of Dyslexia_HP, and we outline some recommendations to further improve this research area.

Characteristics of Chinese-English bilingual Dyslexia_HP in Right_HP occipito-temporal lesion.Current literature suggests that Right_HP hemisphere lesions produce predominant spatial-related dyslexic error in English speakers. However, little is known regarding such lesions in Chinese speakers. In this paper, we describe the dyslexic characteristics of a Chinese-English bilingual patient with a Right_HP posterior cortical lesion. He was found to have Profound_HP spatial-related errors during his English word reading, in both real and non-words. During Chinese word reading, there was significantly less error compared to English, probably due to the ideographic nature of the Chinese language. He was also found to commit phonological-like visual errors in English, characterized by error responses that were visually similar to the actual word. There was no significant difference in visual errors during English word reading compared with Chinese. In general, our patient's performance in both languages appears to be consistent with the current literature on Right_HP posterior hemisphere lesions. Additionally, his performance also likely suggests that the Right_HP posterior cortical region participates in the visual analysis of orthographical word representation, both in ideographical and alphabetic languages, at least from a bilingual perspective. Future studies should further examine the role of the Right_HP posterior region in initial visual analysis of both languages.

RADAR: A novel fast-screening method for reading difficulties with special focus on Dyslexia_HP.Dyslexia_HP is a developmental learning disorder of single word reading accuracy and/or fluency, with compelling research directed towards understanding the contributions of the visual system. While Dyslexia_HP is not an oculomotor disease, readers with Dyslexia_HP have shown different eye movements than typically developing students during text reading. Readers with Dyslexia_HP exhibit longer and more Frequent_HP fixations, shorter saccade lengths, more backward refixations than typical readers. Furthermore, readers with Dyslexia_HP are known to have difficulty in reading long words, lower skipping rate of short words, and high gaze duration on many words. It is an open question whether it is possible to harness these distinctive oculomotor scanning patterns observed during reading in order to develop a screening tool that can reliably identify struggling readers, who may be candidates for Dyslexia_HP. Here, we introduce a novel, fast, objective, non-invasive method, named Rapid Assessment of Difficulties and Abnormalities in Reading (RADAR) that screens for features associated with the aberrant visual scanning of reading text seen in Dyslexia_HP. Eye tracking parameter measurements that are Stable_HP under retest and have high discriminative power, as indicated by their ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curves, were obtained during silent text reading. These parameters were combined to derive a total reading score (TRS) that can reliably separate readers with Dyslexia_HP from typical readers. We tested TRS in a group of school-age children ranging from 8.5 to 12.5 years of age. TRS achieved 94.2% correct classification of children tested. Specifically, 35 out of 37 control (specificity 94.6%) and 30 out of 32 readers with Dyslexia_HP (sensitivity 93.8%) were classified correctly using RADAR, under a circular validation condition (see section Results/Total Reading Score) where the individual evaluated was not included in the test construction group. In conclusion, RADAR is a novel, automated, fast and reliable way to identify children at high risk of Dyslexia_HP that is amenable to large-scale screening. Moreover, analysis of eye movement parameters obtained with RADAR during reading will likely be useful for implementing individualized treatment strategies and for monitoring objectively the success of chosen interventions. We envision that it will be possible to use RADAR as a sensitive, objective, and quantitative first pass screen to identify individuals with reading disorders that manifest with abnormal oculomotor reading strategies, like Dyslexia_HP.

Improvements in reading accuracy as a result of increased interletter spacing are not specific to children with Dyslexia_HP.Recently, increased interletter spacing (LS) has been studied as a way to enhance reading fluency. It is suggested that increased LS improves reading performance, especially in poor readers. Theoretically, these findings are well substantiated as a result of diminished crowding effects. Empirically, however, findings on LS are inconclusive. In two experiments, we examined whether effects of increased LS are specific to children with Dyslexia_HP and whether increased LS Affect_ASDPTOs word or sentence processing. In the first experiment, 30 children with Dyslexia_HP and 30 controls (mean age=9years 11months) read sentences in standard and increased LS conditions. In the second experiment, these sentences were read by an unselected sample of 189 readers (mean age=9years 3months) in either a sentence or word-by-word reading condition. The first experiment showed that increased LS Affect_ASDPTOed_HP children with Dyslexia_HP and controls in similar ways. Participants made fewer errors in the increased LS condition than in the standard LS condition. Reading rates were not Affect_ASDPTOed_HP. There were no indications that the effect of LS was related to reading ability, not even for a subgroup of readers. Findings of the second experiment were similar. Increased LS resulted in fewer errors, not faster reading rates. This was found only when complete sentences were presented, not when sentences were read word by word. Three main conclusions can be drawn. First, increased LS appears to Affect_ASDPTO reading accuracy only. Second, the findings do not support claims that increased LS specifically Affect_ASDPTOs poor readers. And third, the effect of LS seems to occur at the interword level. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.

A Preliminary Comparison of Reading Subtypes in a Clinical Sample of Children With Specific Language_impairment_HP.The purpose of this preliminary study was to (a) compare the pattern of reading subtypes among a clinical sample of children with specific Language_impairment_HP (SLI) and children with typical language and (b) evaluate phonological and nonphonological language deficits within each reading impairment subtype.

Early dynamics of white matter deficits in children developing Dyslexia_HP.Neural anomalies have been demonstrated in Dyslexia_HP. Recent studies in pre-readers at risk for Dyslexia_HP and in pre-readers developing poor reading suggest that these anomalies might be a cause of their reading impairment. Our study goes one step further by exploring the neurodevelopmental trajectory of white matter anomalies in pre-readers with and without a familial risk for Dyslexia_HP (n=61) of whom a strictly selected sample develops Dyslexia_HP later on (n=15). We collected longitudinal diffusion MRI and behavioural data until grade 3. The results provide evidence that children with Dyslexia_HP exhibit pre-reading white matter anomalies in Left_HP and Right_HP long segment of the arcuate fasciculus (AF), with predictive power of the Left_HP segment above traditional cognitive measures and familial risk. Whereas white matter differences in the Left_HP AF seem most strongly related to the development of Dyslexia_HP, differences in the Left_HP IFOF and in the Right_HP AF seem driven by both familial risk and later reading ability. Moreover, differences in the Left_HP AF appeared to be dynamic. This study supports and expands recent insights into the neural basis of Dyslexia_HP, pointing towards pre-reading anomalies related to Dyslexia_HP, as well as underpinning the dynamic character of white matter.

Acquired epileptic opercular syndrome related to a heterozygous deleterious substitution in GRIN2A.Epileptic encephalopathies with continuous spike-and-waves during sleep (Continuous_spike_and_waves_during_slow_sleep_HP) are characterized by cognitive or Language_impairment_HP, and are occasionally associated with pathogenic variants of the GRIN2A gene. In these disorders, speech dysfunction could be either related to cerebral dysfunction caused by the GRIN2A deleterious variant or intense interictal epileptic activity. Here, we present a patient with Speech_Apraxia_HP, clearly linked to Severity_HP of Epilepsy_ASDPTO, carrying a GRIN2A variant. A 6-year-old boy developed Acute_HP regression of Expressive_Language_ASDPTO following epileptic Seizures_ASDPTO_HP, leading to complete Mutism_HP, at which time EEG revealed Continuous_spike_and_waves_during_slow_sleep_HP. MEG showed Bilateral_HP superior parietal and opercular independent Continuous_spike_and_waves_during_slow_sleep_HP onsets and PET with fluorodeoxyglucose demonstrated significant increase in relative glucose metabolism in Bilateral_HP superior parietal regions. Corticosteroids induced a regression of Continuous_spike_and_waves_during_slow_sleep_HP together with impressive improvement in speech abilities. This case supports the hypothesis of a triggering role for epileptic discharges in speech deterioration observed in children carrying a deleterious variant of GRIN2A. When classic antiepileptic drugs fail to control epileptic activity, corticosteroids should be considered. Multimodal functional neuroimaging suggests a role for opercular and superior parietal areas in acquired epileptic opercular syndrome. [Published with video sequences on www.epilepticdisorders.com].

Visual motion and rapid auditory processing are solid endophenotypes of developmental Dyslexia_HP.Although a genetic component is known to have an important role in the etiology of developmental Dyslexia_HP (DD), we are far from understanding the molecular etiopathogenetic pathways. Reduced measures of neurobiological functioning related to reading (dis)ability, i.e. endophenotypes (EPs), are promising targets for gene finding and the elucidation of the underlying mechanisms. In a sample of 100 nuclear families with DD (229 offspring) and 83 unrelated typical readers, we tested whether a set of well-established, cognitive phenotypes related to DD [i.e. rapid auditory processing (RAP), rapid automatized naming (RAN), multisensory nonspatial attention and visual motion processing] fulfilled the criteria of the EP construct. Visual motion and RAP satisfied all testable criteria (i.e. they are heritable, associate with the disorder, co-segregate with the disorder within a family and represent reproducible measures) and are therefore solid EPs of DD. Multisensory nonspatial attention satisfied three of four criteria (i.e. it associates with the disorder, co-segregates with the disorder within a family and represents a reproducible measure) and is therefore a potential EP for DD. Rapid automatized naming is heritable but does not meet other criteria of the EP construct. We provide the first evidence of a methodologically and statistically sound approach for identifying EPs for DD to be exploited as a solid alternative basis to clinical phenotypes in neuroscience.

Visual_Agnosia_HP and Focal_HP brain injury.Visual_Agnosia_HP encompasses all disorders of visual recognition within a selective visual modality not due to an impairment of elementary visual processing or other cognitive deficit. Based on a sequential dichotomy between the perceptual and memory systems, two different categories of visual object Agnosia_HP are usually considered: 'apperceptive Agnosia_HP' and 'associative Agnosia_HP'. Impaired visual recognition within a single category of stimuli is also reported in: (i) visual object Agnosia_HP of the ventral pathway, such as prosopAgnosia_HP (for faces), pure Alexia_HP (for words), or topographAgnosia_HP (for landmarks); (ii) visual spatial Agnosia_HP of the dorsal pathway, such as cerebral akinetopsia (for movement), or orientation Agnosia_HP (for the placement of objects in space). Focal_HP brain injuries provide a unique opportunity to better understand regional brain function, particularly with the use of effective statistical approaches such as voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM). The aim of the present work was twofold: (i) to review the various Agnosia_HP categories according to the traditional visual dual-pathway model; and (ii) to better assess the anatomical network underlying visual recognition through lesion-mapping studies correlating neuroanatomical and clinical outcomes.

From word reading to multisentence comprehension: Improvements in brain activity in children with Autism_HP after reading intervention.Children with Autistic_behavior_HP show a unique reading profile characterized by decoding abilities equivalent to verbal abilities, but with lower comprehension skills. Neuroimaging studies have found recruitment of regions primarily associated with visual processing (e.g., fusiform gyrus and medial parietal cortex), but reduced activation in frontal and temporal regions, when reading in adults with Autistic_behavior_HP. The purpose of this study was to assess neural changes associated with an intense reading intervention program in children with Autistic_behavior_HP using three fMRI tasks of reading.

Subgroups in language trajectories from 4 to 11 years: the nature and predictors of Stable_HP, improving and decreasing language trajectory groups.Little is known about the nature, range and prevalence of different subgroups in language trajectories extant in a population from 4 to 11 years. This hinders strategic targeting and design of interventions, particularly targeting those whose difficulties will likely persist.

Enrichment of putatively damaging rare variants in the DYX2 locus and the reading-related genes CCDC136 and FLNC.Eleven loci with prior evidence for association with reading and language phenotypes were sequenced in 96 unrelated subjects with significant impairment in reading performance drawn from the Colorado Learning Disability Research Center collection. Out of 148 total individual missense variants identified, the chromosome 7 genes CCDC136 and FLNC contained 19. In addition, a region corresponding to the well-known DYX2 locus for RD contained 74 missense variants. Both allele sets were filtered for a minor allele Frequency_HP ≤0.01 and high Polyphen-2 scores. To determine if observations of these alleles are occurring more frequently in our cases than expected by chance in aggregate, counts from our sample were compared to the number of observations in the European subset of the 1000 Genomes Project using Fisher's exact test. Significant P values were achieved for both CCDC136/FLNC (P = 0.0098) and the DYX2 locus (P = 0.012). Taken together, this evidence further supports the influence of these regions on reading performance. These results also support the influence of rare variants in Dyslexia_HP.

Pediatric ophthalmology and childhood reading difficulties: Amblyopia_HP and slow reading.Reading is a major life activity, as recognized by the US Congress in the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008, and the education code of most US states requires schools to evaluate reading and implement reading programs to addresses students' reading difficulties. Currently, such legislation is employed to identify accommodations needed for children with Bilateral_HP Visual_impairment_HP and for children with Dyslexia_HP and/or related learning disabilities. Yet recent research has shown that children with the most common form of monocular Visual_impairment_HP-Amblyopia_HP-read slowly. Slow reading can be detrimental to academic performance and learning, which in turn may Affect_ASDPTO self-esteem. Parents and educators can work together to implement accommodations (eg, extra time) to help amblyopic students succeed in their daily school tasks, and improve their performance on the timed, standardized tests that are critical for promotion and admission to magnet schools, TAG programs, high schools, and colleges. Children with other visual disorders that cause Visual_impairment_HP in one eye (eg, Glaucoma_HP, Cataract_HP, trauma, etc) should also be considered for academic accommodations.

Children with other visual disorders that cause visual impairment in one eye (eg, glaucoma, cataract, trauma, etc) should also be considered for academic accommodations.

Pediatric ophthalmology and childhood reading difficulties: Impaired_convergence_HP: relationship to reading and academic performance.Patients with Impaired_convergence_HP (CI) are often symptomatic during activities that require near fixation, such as reading. Indeed, CI has been associated with reading impairment and poor academic performance. However, these associations do not prove a causal relationship between these conditions. The current evidence regarding the relationship between CI and its treatment, reading ability, and academic performance is discussed.

Pediatric ophthalmology and childhood reading difficulties: Overview of reading development and assessments for the pediatric ophthalmologist.Reading difficulties are common in the pediatric population, and large socioeconomic disparities exist. In the United States 46% of white children achieved expected reading proficiency by the end of fourth grade, while only 21% of Hispanic and 18% of African American children were reading at the expected level. Reading is an involved cognitive process with many subskills; likewise, development of reading proficiency is a complex and continuous process. Failure to achieve reading proficiency or even early difficulty with reading can Affect_ASDPTO a child's academic performance for years to come. Some studies suggest reading proficiency may be related to later success in life. Although many problems with reading are not related to vision, a vision assessment is recommended for children with reading difficulties and a suspected vision problem. The process of reading development as well as the varied educational assessments of reading are presented here for pediatric ophthalmologists.

Data-Driven Topological Filtering Based on Orthogonal Minimal Spanning Trees: Application to Multigroup Magnetoencephalography Resting-State Connectivity.In the present study, a novel data-driven topological filtering technique is introduced to derive the backbone of functional brain networks relying on orthogonal minimal spanning trees (OMSTs). The method aims to identify the essential functional connections to ensure optimal information flow via the objective criterion of global efficiency minus the cost of surviving connections. The OMST technique was applied to multichannel, resting-state neuromagnetic recordings from four groups of participants: Healthy_HP adults (n = 50), adults who have suffered Mild_HP traumatic brain injury (n = 30), typically developing children (n = 27), and reading-disabled children (n = 25). Weighted interactions between network nodes (sensors) were computed using an integrated approach of dominant intrinsic coupling modes based on two alternative metrics (symbolic mutual information and phase lag index), resulting in excellent discrimination of individual cases according to their group membership. Classification results using OMST-derived functional networks were clearly superior to results using either relative power spectrum features or functional networks derived through the conventional minimal spanning tree algorithm.

Lexical decision performance in developmental surface Dysgraphia_HP: Evidence for a unitary orthographic system that is used in both reading and spelling.The relationship between spelling, written word recognition, and picture naming is investigated in a study of seven bilingual adults who have developmental surface Dysgraphia_HP in both Greek (their first language) and English (their second language). Four of the cases also performed poorly at orthographic lexical decision in both languages. This finding is consistent with similar results in Italian that have been taken as evidence of a developmental impairment to a single orthographic system that is used for both reading and spelling. The remaining three participants performed well at orthographic lexical decision. At first sight, preserved lexical decision in surface Dysgraphia_HP is less easy to explain in terms of a shared orthographic system. However, the results of subsequent experiments showed clear parallels between the nature of the reading and spelling difficulties that these three individuals experienced, consistent with the existence of a single orthographic system. The different patterns that were observed were consistent with the claims of Friedmann and Lukov (2008. Developmental surface Dyslexia_HP. Cortex, 44, 1146-1160) that several distinct sub-types of developmental surface Dyslexia_HP exist. We show that individual differences in spelling in surface Dysgraphia_HP are also consistent with these sub-types; there are different developmental deficits that can give rise, in an individual, to a combination of surface Dyslexia_HP and Dysgraphia_HP. Finally, we compare the theoretical framework used by Friedmann and her colleagues that is based upon the architecture of the DRC model with an account that relies instead upon the Triangle model of reading].

Morphology and Spelling in French: A Comparison of At-Risk Readers and Typically Developing Children.We present two studies that examine the role of morphology in French spelling. In Study 1, we examined the concurrent and longitudinal relationships between inflectional awareness and derivational awareness and spelling within a sample of 77 children in a French immersion programme in Canada. Children completed a non-verbal Reasoning_ASDPTO measure and French measures of phonological awareness, word reading, vocabulary, morphological awareness, and spelling. Results showed that inflectional morphological awareness in Grade 3 was a predictor of spelling in the same grade. Inflectional awareness in Grade 2 predicted Grade 3 spelling, controlling for reading-related skills and spelling at Grade 2. These analyses support the role of inflectional morphological awareness in the development of spelling of children of a range of reading and spelling abilities. In contrast, derivational awareness in Grades 2 and 3 did not predict spelling concurrently in both grades respectively. Study 2 contrasted the morphological errors in the spellings of six children at risk for reading difficulties with those of six chronological age-matched and six reading level-matched children. Analyses showed that at-risk children exhibited more difficulties with spelling roots and suffixes in words as compared with their age-matched peers, although they performed similarly to children matched on reading level.

What can Parents' Self-report of Reading Difficulties Tell Us about Their Children's Emergent Literacy at School Entry?Research has linked family risk (FR) of reading difficulties (RD) with children's difficulties in emergent literacy development. This study is the first to apply parents' self-report of RD as a proxy for FR in a large sample (n = 1171) in order to test group differences in children's emergent literacy. Emergent literacy, the home literacy environment and children's interest in literacy and letters were compared across different groups of FR children around the school entry. The FR children performed lower in emergent literacy compared with not-FR children. Furthermore, when comparing FR children with one parent reporting RD and children with both parents reporting RD, Moderate_HP group differences were found in Emergent Literacy. Finally, parents' self-report of RD was a significant contributor of emergent literacy after controlling for the home literacy environment, children's gender, their interest in literacy and letters, months in kindergarten, vocabulary and parents' education. Our findings suggest that schools should monitor the reading development of children with parents self-reporting RD closely - especially if both parents self-report RD. © 2017 The Authors.

Towards identifying Dyslexia_HP in Standard Indonesian: the development of a reading assessment battery.With its transparent orthography, Standard Indonesian is spoken by over 160 million inhabitants and is the primary language of instruction in education and the government in Indonesia. An assessment battery of reading and reading-related skills was developed as a starting point for the Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Dyslexia_HP in beginner learners. Founded on the International Dyslexia_HP Association's definition of Dyslexia_HP, the test battery comprises nine empirically motivated reading and reading-related tasks assessing word reading, pseudoword reading, arithmetic, rapid automatized naming, phoneme deletion, forward and backward digit span, verbal fluency, orthographic choice (spelling), and writing. The test was validated by computing the relationships between the outcomes on the reading-skills and reading-related measures by means of correlation and factor analyses. External variables, i.e., school grades and teacher ratings of the reading and learning abilities of individual students, were also utilized to provide evidence of its construct validity. Four variables were found to be significantly related with reading-skill measures: phonological awareness, rapid naming, spelling, and digit span. The current study on reading development in Standard Indonesian confirms findings from other languages with transparent orthographies and suggests a test battery including preliminary norm scores for screening and assessment of elementary school children learning to read Standard Indonesian.

Face and Word Recognition Can Be Selectively Affected_HP by Brain Injury or Developmental Disorders.Face and word recognition have traditionally been thought to rely on highly specialised and relatively independent cognitive processes. Some of the strongest evidence for this has come from patients with seemingly category-specific visual perceptual deficits such as pure Prosopagnosia_HP, a selective face recognition deficit, and pure Alexia_HP, a selective word recognition deficit. Together, the patterns of impaired reading with preserved face recognition and impaired face recognition with preserved reading constitute a double dissociation. The existence of these selective deficits has been questioned over the past decade. It has been suggested that studies describing patients with these pure deficits have failed to measure the supposedly preserved functions using sensitive enough measures, and that if tested using sensitive measurements, all patients with deficits in one visual category would also have deficits in the other. The implications of this would be immense, with most textbooks in cognitive neuropsychology requiring drastic revisions. In order to evaluate the evidence for dissociations, we review studies that specifically investigate whether face or word recognition can be selectively Affected_HP by acquired brain injury or developmental disorders. We only include studies published since 2004, as comprehensive reviews of earlier studies are available. Most of the studies assess the supposedly preserved functions using sensitive measurements. We found convincing evidence that reading can be preserved in acquired and developmental Prosopagnosia_HP and also evidence (though weaker) that face recognition can be preserved in acquired or developmental Dyslexia_HP, suggesting that face and word recognition are at least in part supported by independent processes.

Psychometric Properties of Language Assessments for Children Aged 4-12 Years: A Systematic Review. Standardized assessments are widely used by speech pathologists in clinical and research settings to evaluate the language abilities of school-aged children and inform decisions about Diagnosis_ASDPTO, eligibility for services and intervention. Given the significance of these decisions, it is important that assessments have sound psychometric properties.

Relationships between Eye Movements during Sentence Reading Comprehension, Word Spelling and Reading, and DTI and fmri Connectivity In Students with and without Dysgraphia_HP or Dyslexia_HP.While eye movements were recorded and brains scanned, 29 children with and without specific learning disabilities (SLDs) decided if sentences they read (half with only correctly spelled words and half with homonym foils) were meaningful. Significant main effects were found for diagnostic groups (non-SLD control, Dysgraphia_HP control, and Dyslexia_HP) in total fixation (dwell) time, total number of fixations, and total regressions in during saccades; the Dyslexia_HP group had longer and more fixations and made more regressions in during saccades than either control group. The Dyslexia_HP group also differed from both control groups in (a) fractional anisotropy in Left_HP optic radiation and (b) silent word reading fluency on a task in which surrounding letters can be distracting, consistent with Rayner's selective attention Dyslexia_HP model. Different profiles for non-SLD control, Dysgraphia_HP, and Dyslexia_HP groups were identified in correlations between total fixation time, total number of fixations, regressions in during saccades, magnitude of gray matter connectivity during the fMRI sentence reading comprehension from Left_HP occipital temporal cortex seed with Right_HP BA44 and from Left_HP inferior frontal gyrus with Right_HP inferior frontoccipital fasciculus, and normed word-specific spelling and silent word reading fluency measures. The Dysgraphia_HP group was more likely than the non-SLD control or Dyslexia_HP groups to show negative correlations between eye movement outcomes and sentences containing incorrect homonym foils. Findings are discussed in reference to a systems approach in future sentence reading comprehension research that integrates eye movement, brain, and literacy measures.

Identifying Dyslexia_HP Risk in Student-Athletes: A Preliminary Protocol for Concussion Management.Learning disability (LD) has been identified as a potential risk factor for a sport-related concussion, yet students with LD are rarely included in concussion research. Here, we draw special attention to Dyslexia_HP, a common but often underdiagnosed LD. Reading and learning problems commonly associated with Dyslexia_HP are often masked by protective factors, such as high verbal ability or general intelligence. Hence, high-achieving individuals with Dyslexia_HP may not be identified as being in a high-risk category. To ensure that students with Dyslexia_HP are included in LD concussion research and identified as LD in baseline testing, we provide athletic trainers with an overview of Dyslexia_HP and a preliminary screening protocol that is sensitive to Dyslexia_HP, even among academically high-achieving students in secondary school and college.

Do prereaders' auditory processing and speech perception predict later literacy?Developmental Dyslexia_HP has frequently been linked to deficits in auditory processing and speech perception. However, the presence and precise nature of these deficits and the direction of their relation with reading, remains debated. In this longitudinal study, 87 five-year-olds at high and low family risk for Dyslexia_HP were followed before and during different stages of reading acquisition. The processing of different auditory cues was investigated, together with performance on speech perception and phonology and reading. Results show no effect of family risk for Dyslexia_HP on prereading auditory processing and speech perception skills. However, a relation is present between the performance on these skills in kindergarten and later phonology and literacy. In particular, links are found with the auditory processing of cues characteristic for the temporal speech amplitude envelope, rather than with other auditory cues important for speech intelligibility. Hereby, cues embedded in the speech amplitude envelope show to be related to a broad range of phonological precursors for reading. In addition, speech-in-noise perception demonstrates to operate as the most contributing factor for later phonological awareness and to be a predictor for reading mediated by the association with phonology. This study provides behavioral support for the link between prereading speech amplitude envelope processing and speech perception for future phonology and reading.
Do prereaders' auditory processing and speech perception predict later literacy?Developmental dyslexia has frequently been linked to deficits in auditory processing and speech perception. However, the presence and precise nature of these deficits and the direction of their relation with reading, remains debated. In this longitudinal study, 87 five-year-olds at high and low family risk for dyslexia were followed before and during different stages of reading acquisition. The processing of different auditory cues was investigated, together with performance on speech perception and phonology and reading. Results show no effect of family risk for dyslexia on prereading auditory processing and speech perception skills. However, a relation is present between the performance on these skills in kindergarten and later phonology and literacy. In particular, links are found with the auditory processing of cues characteristic for the temporal speech amplitude envelope, rather than with other auditory cues important for speech intelligibility. Hereby, cues embedded in the speech amplitude envelope show to be related to a broad range of phonological precursors for reading. In addition, speech-in-noise perception demonstrates to operate as the most contributing factor for later phonological awareness and to be a predictor for reading mediated by the association with phonology. This study provides behavioral support for the link between prereading speech amplitude envelope processing and speech perception for future phonology and reading.
Reading difficulties and the pediatric ophthalmologist.Approximately 20% of children have Dyslexia_HP, a language-based Dyslexia_HP. A variation in language processing in the brain leads to a deficit in phonological (auditory) processing, which leads to problems in learning to read, write, and spell. Myths continue to exist regarding Dyslexia_HP and vision, and although eye and vision problems may coexist with Dyslexia_HP, they are not more prevalent than in the general population. Rarely vision problems may make reading at near very difficult and may masquerade as a learning problem or Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_HP/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_HP Hyperactivity_HP disorder. The pediatric ophthalmologist can play a valuable role in determining whether any eye or vision problems exist that might interfere with learning or reading. Treatments to improve these eye conditions may help make reading more comfortable, but they are not a therapy for coexisting Dyslexia_HP. The use of vision therapy has never been shown scientifically to be effective and may prevent the application of effective interventions during the critical period of development when reading disorders can best be remediated. The pediatric ophthalmologist should educate parents about reading and Dyslexia_HP and provide prompt referral to professionals who have expertise in evaluating and treating learning disabilities.

Slow reading in children with anisometropic Amblyopia_HP is associated with fixation instability and increased saccades.Previous studies show slow reading in strabismic Amblyopia_HP. We recently identified Amblyopia_HP, not Strabismus_HP, as the key factor in slow reading in children. No studies have focused on reading in amblyopic children without Strabismus_HP. We examined reading in anisometropic children and evaluated whether slow reading was associated with ocular motor dysfunction in children with Amblyopia_HP.

Six factors of adult Dyslexia_HP assessed by cognitive tests and self-report questions: Very high predictive validity.The Multiple Diagnostic Digital Dyslexia_HP Test for Adults (MDDDT-A) consists of 12 newly developed tests and self-report questions in the Dutch language. Predictive validity and construct validity were investigated and compared with validity of a standard test battery of Dyslexia_HP (STB) in a sample of 154 students. There are three main results. First, various analyses of principal components showed that six or more factors of Dyslexia_HP can be distinguished (rapid naming, spelling, reading, short-term memory, Confusion_HP, phonology, attention, complexity). All factors are represented by the MDDDT-A. Second, various discriminant analyses showed good predictive validity for both the tests of the MDDDT-A (90%) and the STB (90%). However, predictive validity of the questionnaire was highest (97%). Third, we analysed the best predictors of Dyslexia_HP and found that predictive validity is higher when construct validity is high, that is when a set of predictors represents many characteristics of Dyslexia_HP. The main conclusion is that a digital test battery can be a reliable screening instrument for Dyslexia_HP in students, especially when it is accompanied by self-report questions. A theoretical conclusion is that Dyslexia_HP is characterized by at least six cognitive impairments in a complex way. In students, this structure may be modulated by high intelligence and good schooling through various compensation strategies. It is therefore recommended to include assessments of all characteristics of Dyslexia_HP to achieve the most reliable diagnoses in different samples and in different countries.

Knockout Mice for Dyslexia_HP Susceptibility Gene Homologs KIAA0319 and KIAA0319L have UnAffect_ASDPTOed_HP Neuronal Migration but Display Abnormal Auditory Processing.Developmental Dyslexia_HP is a neurodevelopmental disorder that Affect_ASDPTOs reading ability caused by genetic and non-genetic factors. Amongst the susceptibility genes identified to date, KIAA0319 is a prime candidate. RNA-interference experiments in rats suggested its involvement in cortical migration but we could not confirm these findings in Kiaa0319-mutant mice. Given its homologous gene Kiaa0319L (AU040320) has also been proposed to play a role in neuronal migration, we interrogated whether absence of AU040320 alone or together with KIAA0319 Affect_ASDPTOs migration in the developing brain. Analyses of AU040320 and double Kiaa0319;AU040320 knockouts (dKO) revealed no evidence for impaired cortical lamination, neuronal migration, neurogenesis or other anatomical abnormalities. However, dKO mice displayed an auditory deficit in a behavioral gap-in-noise detection task. In addition, recordings of click-evoked auditory brainstem responses revealed suprathreshold deficits in wave III amplitude in AU040320-KO mice, and more general deficits in dKOs. These findings suggest that absence of AU040320 disrupts firing and/or synchrony of activity in the auditory brainstem, while loss of both proteins might Affect_ASDPTO both Peripheral_HP and Central_HP auditory function. Overall, these results stand against the proposed role of KIAA0319 and AU040320 in neuronal migration and outline their relationship with deficits in the auditory system.

Left_HP-Right_HP asymmetry of the Maxwell spot centroids in adults without and with Dyslexia_HP.In human vision, the brain has to select one view of the world from our two eyes. However, the existence of a clear anatomical asymmetry providing an initial Postural_instability_HP for normal neural development is still not understood. Using a so-called foveascope, we found that for a cohort of 30 normal adults, the two blue cone-free areas at the centre of the foveas are asymmetrical. The noise-stimulated afterimage dominant eye introduced here corresponds to the circular blue cone-free area, while the non-dominant eye corresponds to the Diffuse_HP and irregular elliptical outline. By contrast, we found that this asymmetry is absent or frustrated in a similar cohort of 30 adults with normal ocular status, but with Dyslexia_HP, i.e. with visual and phonological deficits. In this case, our results show that the two Maxwell centroid outlines are both circular but lead to an undetermined afterimage dominance with a coexistence of primary and mirror images. The interplay between the lack of asymmetry and the development in the neural maturation of the brain pathways suggests new implications in both fundamental and biomedical sciences.

A New Dyslexia_HP Reading Method and Visual Correction Position_HP Method.Pediatricians and educators may interact daily with several dyslexic patients or students. One dyslexic author accidently developed a personal, effective, corrective reading method. Its effectiveness was evaluated in 3 schools. One school utilized 8 demonstration special education students. Over 3 months, one student grew one third year, 3 grew 1 year, and 4 grew 2 years. In another school, 6 sixth-, seventh-, and eighth-grade classroom teachers followed 45 treated dyslexic students. They all excelled and progressed beyond their classroom peers in 4 months. Using cyclovergence upper gaze, dyslexic reading problems disappeared at one of the Position_HPal Reading Arc positions of 30°, 60°, 90°, 120°, or 150° for 10 dyslexics. Position_HPal Reading Arc on 112 students of the second through eighth grades showed words read per minute, reading errors, and comprehension improved. Dyslexia_HP was visually corrected by use of a new reading method and Position_HPal Reading Arc positions.

Lexical processing and distributional knowledge in sound-spelling mapping in a consistent orthography: A longitudinal study of reading and spelling in dyslexic and typically developing children.This study examined the ability to master lexical processing and use knowledge of the relative Frequency_HP of sound-spelling mappings in both reading and spelling. Twenty-four dyslexic and dysgraphic children and 86 typically developing readers were followed longitudinally in 3rd and 5th grades. Effects of word regularity, word Frequency_HP, and probability of sound-spelling mappings were examined in two experimental tasks: (a) spelling to dictation; and (b) orthographic judgment. Dyslexic children showed larger regularity and Frequency_HP effects than controls in both tasks. Sensitivity to distributional information of sound-spelling mappings was already detected by third grade, indicating early acquisition even in children with Dyslexia_HP. Although with notable differences, knowledge of the relative frequencies of sound-spelling mapping influenced both reading and spelling. Results are discussed in terms of their theoretical and empirical implications.

Dyslexic Characteristics of Chinese-Speaking Semantic Variant of Primary Progressive_HP Aphasia_HP.Reading disorder is a recognized feature in primary Progressive_HP Aphasia_HP (PPA). Surface Dyslexia_HP, characterized by regularization errors, is typically seen in the English-speaking semantic variant of PPA (svPPA). However, dyslexic characteristics of other languages, particularly logographical languages such as Chinese, remain sparse in the literature. This study aims to characterize and describe the dyslexic pattern in this group of patients by comparing an English-speaking svPPA group with a Chinese-speaking svPPA group. The authors hypothesized that Chinese-speaking individuals with svPPA would likely commit fewer surface dyslexic errors. By accessing the database of Singapore's National Neuroscience Institute and the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center of the United States, the authors identified three Chinese-speaking and 18 English-speaking patients with svPPA, respectively, for comparison. The results suggest that, instead of surface Dyslexia_HP, svPPA in Chinese-speaking individuals is characterized by a Profound_HP deep dyslexic error. Based on current evidence suggesting the role of the temporal pole as a semantic convergence center, the authors conclude that this region also mediates and converges lexical-semantic significance in logographical languages.

L1 and L2 reading skills in Dutch adolescents with a familial risk of Dyslexia_HP.The present study investigated differences in reading and spelling outcomes in Dutch and English as a second language (ESL) in adolescents with a high familial risk of Dyslexia_HP, of whom some have developed Dyslexia_HP (HRDys) while others have not (HRnonDys), in comparison to a low familial risk control group without Dyslexia_HP (LRnonDys). This allowed us to investigate the persistence of Dyslexia_HP in the first language (L1) and the effect of Dyslexia_HP on the second language (L2), which has, in this case, a lower orthographic transparency. Furthermore, the inclusion of the HRnonDys group allowed us to investigate the continuity of the familial risk of Dyslexia_HP, as previous studies observed that the HRnonDys group often scores in between the HRDys and LRnonDys group, and whether these readers without reading deficits in Dutch, have more reading difficulties in ESL.

The role of READ1 and KIAA0319 genetic variations in developmental Dyslexia_HP: testing main and interactive effects.Developmental Dyslexia_HP (DD) is a complex heritable condition characterized by impaired reading abilities. Two well-replicated candidate risk factors are as follows: (1) regulatory element associated with Dyslexia_HP 1 (READ1), which is located in intron 2 of DCDC2 and acts as a binding site for protein regulation of DCDC2 expression; and (2) a three-single-nucleotide polymorphism risk haplotype spanning KIAA0319. Phylogenetically similar READ1 variants showed synergistic effects with the KIAA0319 risk haplotype on reading-related phenotypes in a general population sample. Here we examine the association between different allele classes in READ1, the KIAA0319 risk haplotype and reading-related traits in a cohort of 368 Italian children with DD and their siblings (n=266) by testing both main and non-additive effects. We replicated the deleterious main effects upon both reading accuracy and speed exerted by the longer READ1 alleles. We further supported the interdependence through non-additive, possibly antagonistic, effects between READ1 and the KIAA0319 risk haplotype on reading accuracy. By suggesting the presence of common biological processes underlying reading (dis)ability, these findings represent initial support for a generalist effect of the non-additive interdependence between READ1 and the KIAA0319 risk haplotype. Moreover, our results confirm that using as much information as possible about genetic interdependence among Dyslexia_HP-candidate genes can help in clinically assessing the individual risk for DD.

Genetic and environmental risk factors for developmental Dyslexia_HP in children: systematic review of the last decade.Despite advances in the characterization of developmental Dyslexia_HP (DD), several questions regarding the interplay between DD-susceptibility genes and environmental risk factors remain open. This systematic review aimed at answering the following questions: What has been the impact of new resources on the knowledge about DD? Which questions remain open? What is the investigative agenda for the short term? Forty-six studies were analyzed. Despite the growing literature on DD candidate genes, most studies have not been replicated. We found large effects on causative genes and smaller environmental contributions, involving maternal Smoking_ASDPTO during pregnancy, SES and the DYX1C1-1259C/G marker. Implications are discussed.

Using neurostimulation to understand the impact of pre-morbid individual differences on post-lesion outcomes.Neuropsychological data have proven invaluable in advancing our understanding of higher cognition. The interpretation of such data is, however, complicated by the fact that post-lesion behavioral abnormalities could reflect pre-morbid individual differences in the cognitive domain of interest. Here we exploited the virtual lesion methodology offered by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to explore the impact of pre-morbid individual differences on post-lesion performance. We applied this approach to the domain of reading, a crucial ability in which there are known to be considerable individual differences in the normal population. As predicted by neuropsychological studies of surface Dyslexia_HP in Semantic_Dementia_HP and the connectionist triangle model of reading, previous empirical work has shown that Healthy_HP participants vary in their reliance on meaning for reading words with atypical correspondences between spelling and sound. We therefore selected participants who varied along this dimension and applied a virtual lesion to the Left_HP anterior temporal lobe. As expected, we observed a significant three-way interaction between "pre-morbid" reading status, stimulation, and word type, such that TMS increased the disadvantage for spelling-sound atypical words more for the individuals with stronger semantic reliance. This successful test-case study provides an approach to understanding the impact of pre-morbid individual variation on post-lesion outcomes that could be fruitfully applied to a variety of cognitive domains.

We applied this approach to the domain of reading, a crucial ability in which there are known to be considerable individual differences in the normal population. As predicted by neuropsychological studies of surface dyslexia in semantic dementia and the connectionist triangle model of reading, previous empirical work has shown that healthy participants vary in their reliance on meaning for reading words with atypical correspondences between spelling and sound. We therefore selected participants who varied along this dimension and applied a virtual lesion to the left anterior temporal lobe. As expected, we observed a significant three-way interaction between "pre-morbid" reading status, stimulation, and word type, such that TMS increased the disadvantage for spelling-sound atypical words more for the individuals with stronger semantic reliance. This successful test-case study provides an approach to understanding the impact of pre-morbid individual variation on post-lesion outcomes that could be fruitfully applied to a variety of cognitive domains.
Association between Fine_Motor_Skills_ASDPTO and binocular visual function in children with reading difficulties.Performance of Fine_Motor_Skills_ASDPTO (FMS) assessed by a clinical test battery has been associated with reading achievement in school-age children. However, the nature of this association remains to be established. The aim of this study was to assess FMS in children with reading difficulties using two experimental tasks, and to determine if performance is associated with reduced binocular function. We hypothesized that in comparison to an age- and sex-matched control group, children identified with reading difficulties will perform worse only on a motor task that has been shown to rely on binocular input. To test this hypothesis, motor performance was assessed using two tasks: bead-threading and peg-board in 19 children who were reading below expected grade and age-level. Binocular vision assessment included tests for stereoacuity, fusional vergence, amplitude of accommodation, and accommodative facility. In comparison to the control group, children with reading difficulties performed significantly worse on the bead-threading task. In contrast, performance on the peg-board task was similar in both groups. Accommodative facility was the only measure of binocular function significantly associated with motor performance. Findings from our exploratory study suggest that normal binocular vision may provide an important sensory input for the optimal development of FMS and reading. Given the small sample size tested in the current study, further investigation to assess the contribution of binocular vision to the development and performance of FMS and reading is warranted.

Familial history of reading difficulty is associated with diffused Bilateral_HP brain activation during reading and greater association with visual attention abilities.Reading difficulty (RD; or Dyslexia_HP) is a heritable condition characterized by slow, inaccurate reading accompanied by executive dysfunction, specifically with respect to visual attention. The current study was designed to examine the effect of familial history of RD on the relationship between reading and visual attention abilities in children with RD using a functional MRI reading task. Seventy-one children with RD participated in the study. Based on parental reports of the existence of RD in one or both of each child's parents, children with RD were divided into two groups: (1) those with a familial history of RD and (2) those without a familial history of RD. Reading and visual attention measures were collected from all participants. Functional MRI data during word reading was acquired in 30 participants of the entire cohort. Children with or without a familial history of RD demonstrated below-average reading and visual attention scores, with greater interaction between these measures in the group with a familial history of RD. Greater Bilateral_HP and diffused activation during word reading also were found in this group. We suggest that a familial history of RD is related to greater association between lower reading abilities and visual attention abilities. Parental history of RD therefore may be an important preschool screener (before reading age) to prompt early intervention focused on executive functions and reading-related skills.

How many deficits in the same dyslexic brains? A behavioural and fMRI assessment of comorbidity in adult dyslexics.Dyslexia_HP can have different manifestations: this has motivated different theories on its nature, on its underlying brain bases and enduring controversies on how to best treat it. The relative weight of the different manifestations has never been evaluated using both behavioural and fMRI measures, a challenge taken here to assess the major systems called into play in Dyslexia_HP by different theories. We found that adult well-compensated dyslexics were systematically impaired only in reading and in visuo-phonological tasks, while deficits for other systems (e.g., motor/cerebellar, visual magnocellular/motion perception) were only very Occasional_HP. In line with these findings, fMRI showed a reliable hypoactivation only for the task of reading, in the Left_HP occipito-temporal cortex (l-OTC). The l-OTC, normally a crossroad between the reading system and other systems, did not show the same level of intersection in dyslexics; yet, it was not totally silent because it responded, in segregated parts, during auditory phonological and visual motion perception tasks. This minimal behavioural and functional anatomical comorbidity demonstrates that a specific deficit of reading is the best description for developmental Dyslexia_HP, at least for adult well-compensated cases, with clear implications for rehabilitation strategies. The reduced intersection of multiple systems in the l-OTC suggests that dyslexics suffer from a coarser connectivity, leading to disconnection between the multiple domains that normally interact during reading.

Holistic word processing in Dyslexia_HP.People with Dyslexia_HP have difficulty learning to read and many lack fluent word recognition as adults. In a novel task that borrows elements of the 'word superiority' and 'word inversion' paradigms, we investigate whether holistic word recognition is impaired in Dyslexia_HP. In Experiment 1 students with Dyslexia_HP and controls judged the similarity of pairs of 6- and 7-letter words or pairs of words whose letters had been partially jumbled. The stimuli were presented in both upright and inverted form with orthographic regularity and orientation randomized from trial to trial. While both groups showed sensitivity to orthographic regularity, both word inversion and letter jumbling were more detrimental to skilled than dyslexic readers supporting the idea that the latter may read in a more analytic fashion. Experiment 2 employed the same task but using shorter, 4- and 5-letter words and a design where orthographic regularity and stimuli orientation was held constant within experimental blocks to encourage the use of either holistic or analytic processing. While there was no difference in reaction time between the dyslexic and control groups for inverted stimuli, the students with Dyslexia_HP were significantly slower than controls for upright stimuli. These findings suggest that holistic word recognition, which is largely based on the detection of orthographic regularity, is impaired in Dyslexia_HP.

Saccade adaptation deficits in developmental Dyslexia_HP suggest disruption of cerebellar-dependent learning.Estimates of the prevalence of developmental Dyslexia_HP in the general population range from 5% to as many as 10%. Symptoms include reading, writing, and language deficits, but the Severity_HP and mix of symptoms can vary widely across individuals. In at least some people with Dyslexia_HP, the structure and function of the cerebellum may be disordered. Saccadic adaptation requires proper function of the cerebellum and brainstem circuitry and might provide a simple, noninvasive assay for early identification and sub-phenotyping in populations of children who may have Dyslexia_HP.

Accident ahead? Difficulties of drivers with and without reading impairment recognising words and pictograms in variable message signs.A timely and accurate acquisition of the information provided by variable message signs (VMS) can be crucial while driving. In the current study, we assess the difficulties of adults with Dyslexia_HP acquiring the information shown in VMS and provide evidence to discuss the controversial use of pictograms as potential countermeasures. Twenty-two adults with Dyslexia_HP and 22 matched controls completed a simulated driving session. The legibility of 12 VMS was assessed, including six text messages (e.g. "ACCIDENT") and six single pictograms (e.g. the icon for "accident ahead"). On average, participants with Dyslexia_HP started reading text messages when they were closer to the VMS. In addition, while approaching text VMS, they dedicated more gazes and manifested worse control of speed. Regarding pictogram VMS, we observed no differences in response distance, accuracy, response duration, or number of gazes. To sum up, the evidence provided reveals that adults with Dyslexia_HP, despite potential compensation effects, may still find difficulties reading text messages in VMS (shorter legibility distances, longer reading times, and increased cognitive effort), whereas we found no such differences in the recognition of pictograms (only some difficulties keeping a steady speed). Research on inclusive measures to improve reading in low-skilled or dyslexic drivers must be encouraged.

Take Flight: the evolution of an Orton Gillingham-based curriculum.Thirty years ago in this journal, Aylett Royall Cox reported on the development of Alphabetic Phonics, a revision of the existing Orton Gillingham treatment for children with Dyslexia_HP. This paper continues that discussion and reports on the evolution of that curriculum as it is represented in a comprehensive Dyslexia_HP treatment program informed by intervention research. The paper describes the curriculum and reports data from a hospital-based learning disabilities clinic that provides qualified support for treatment efficacy and the value of added comprehension instruction. The results are then discussed in the context of current and future issues in Dyslexia_HP intervention.

False memory for orthographically versus semantically similar words in adolescents with Dyslexia_HP: a fuzzy-trace theory perspective.The presented research was conducted in order to investigate the connections between developmental Dyslexia_HP and the functioning of verbatim and Gastrointestinal_stroma_tumor_HP memory traces-assumed in the fuzzy-trace theory. The participants were 71 high school students (33 with Dyslexia_HP and 38 without learning difficulties). The modified procedure and multinomial model of Stahl and Klauer (simplified conjoint recognition model) was used to collect and analyze data. Results showed statistically significant differences in four of the model parameters: (a) the probability of verbatim trace recollection upon presentation of orthographically similar stimulus was higher in the control than Dyslexia_HP group, (b) the probability of verbatim trace recollection upon presentation of semantically similar stimulus was higher in the control than Dyslexia_HP group, (c) the probability of Gastrointestinal_stroma_tumor_HP trace retrieval upon presentation of semantically similar stimulus was higher in the Dyslexia_HP than control group, and (d) the probability of Gastrointestinal_stroma_tumor_HP trace retrieval upon target stimulus presentation (in the semantic condition) was higher in the control than Dyslexia_HP group. The obtained results suggest differences of memory functioning in terms of verbatim and Gastrointestinal_stroma_tumor_HP trace retrieval between people with and without Dyslexia_HP on specific, elementary cognitive processes postulated by the fuzzy-trace theory. These can indicate new approaches in the education of persons with developmental Dyslexia_HP, focused on specific impairments and the strengths of their memory functioning.

Inflectional morphology and Dyslexia_HP: Italian children's performance in a nonword pluralization task.In this study, we present the results of an original experimental protocol designed to assess the performance in a pluralization task of 52 Italian children divided into two groups: 24 children with developmental Dyslexia_HP (mean age 10.0 years old) and 28 typically developing children (mean age 9.11 years old). Our task, inspired by Berko's Wug Test, had the aim of testing the subjects' ability to apply pluralization rules to nonwords in the morphologically complex context of Italian nominal inflection. Results demonstrate that dyslexics display poorer morphological skills in comparison to controls, showing lower accuracy in the task. Furthermore, the dissimilar performances reported by the subjects in the different conditions indicate that the ability to inflect nonwords depends on factors such as the rule's productivity, Frequency_HP, and opacity with respect to gender. Finally, the children's performance in this task was significantly related to their reading proficiency, and it could predict accuracy in word reading independently of phonological awareness and Working_Memory_ASDPTO.

Evaluating the impact of Dyslexia_HP laws on the identification of Specific_learning_disability_HP and Dyslexia_HP.Dyslexia_HP is a Specific_learning_disability_HP that impacts word reading accuracy and/or reading fluency. Over half of the states in the USA have passed legislation intended to promote better identification of individuals with Dyslexia_HP. To date, no study has been conducted to investigate the potential impact of state laws on the identification of Specific_learning_disability_HP (SLD), and limited data has been presented on the rate at which students in public school settings are identified with Dyslexia_HP. The first aim of the current study was to determine if any detectable changes in the identification rates of SLD have occurred in states implementing Dyslexia_HP laws because most states do not report number of students identified as dyslexic but rather those students identified with an SLD. The second aim of the study was to characterize the rate of identifying Dyslexia_HP in the two states (Texas and Arkansas) that require public schools to report the number of students identified with Dyslexia_HP. The third aim was to characterize the identification rate across first to 12th grades. Current SLD rates range from 3.2 to 8.5% in all 50 states. Analysis of SLD prevalence rates did not vary between states with and without Dyslexia_HP laws in place. Moreover, there was no change in the identification of SLD once states had implemented these laws. Rates of Dyslexia_HP in Arkansas and Texas were less than 5%. Given the persistent levels indicating lack of reading proficiency, our review of data suggests that overall students with Dyslexia_HP are being underidentified.

The role of feedback in implicit and explicit artificial grammar learning: a comparison between dyslexic and non-dyslexic adults.The importance of feedback for learning has been firmly established over the past few decades. The question of whether feedback plays a significant role in the statistical learning abilities of adults with Dyslexia_HP, however, is currently unresolved. Here, we examined the role of feedback in grammaticality judgment, type of structural knowledge, and confidence rating in both typically developed and dyslexic adults. We implemented two artificial grammar learning experiments: implicit and explicit. The second experiment was directly analogous to the first experiment in all respects except training format: the standard memorization instruction was replaced with an explicit rule-search instruction. Each experiment was conducted with and without performance feedback. While both groups showed significantly improved learning in the feedback-based explicit artificial grammar learning task, only the typically developed adults demonstrated higher levels of conscious structural knowledge. The present study demonstrates that the basis for the grammaticality judgment of adults with Dyslexia_HP differs from that of typically developed adults, regardless of increase in the level of explicitness.

Length effects in pseudo-word spelling: stronger in dyslexic than in non-dyslexic students.It is often discussed whether dyslexics show a deviant pattern of reading and spelling development when compared to typically developing students, or whether they follow the same pattern as other students, only at markedly slower rate. The present cross-sectional study investigated phonological encoding skills in dyslexic Danish students. We compared dyslexic and non-dyslexic students from grades 3, 5, 7, and 9 and examined whether effects of item length were stronger in the dyslexic groups. Mixed between-within subjects analyses of variance revealed significant interactions between Dyslexia_HP status and item length as the dyslexics at all grade levels were more Affected_HP by item length than their non-dyslexic peers. A marked Global_developmental_delay_HP was apparent as the dyslexic group from grade 9 performed on approximately the same level as the non-dyslexic group from grade 3. Although the overall difference between these two groups was not significant, a significant interaction between Dyslexia_HP status and item length remained because the grade 9 dyslexics were more Affected_HP by item length than the younger non-dyslexic students. This difference in error profiles suggests a difference in the developmental patterns of dyslexic vs. non-dyslexic students.

Language and social-emotional and behavioural wellbeing from 4 to 7 years: a community-based study.Language_impairment_HP (LD) and social-emotional and behavioural (SEB) difficulties are common childhood problems that often co-occur. While there is clear evidence of these associations from clinical samples, less is known about community samples. This paper examines these associations in children aged 4-7 years from a community-based longitudinal study. 771 families provided questionnaire and assessment data at 4, 5 and 7 years. Parent-reported SEB difficulties were measured at each point (SDQ). Child language was directly assessed at 4 (CELF-P2), 5 and 7 years (CELF-4). Linear regression analysis was used to compare cross-sectional differences in mean SDQ scores between children with and without LD at each time point. Linear regression was then used to examine how patterns of Language_Development_ASDPTO (language disordered at three time points; never disordered; disordered at one or two time points, i.e. 'unstable' group) related to SEB difficulties at each age, adjusted for potential confounders, as in the previous analyses. Higher Hyperactivity_HP/inattention scores were associated with LD at each age. In fully adjusted models, there was little difference in mean emotional symptoms scores between children with and without LD. The 'never' LD group had lower mean SDQ scores at each time point than the 'unstable' group. Findings highlight that children with persistent LD from preschool to early primary school may be more likely to have concomitant SEB difficulties, particularly behavioural difficulties. Those with unstable LD may also have co-occurring SEB difficulties, showing a need for education and health professionals to monitor early language and SEB development.
Language and social-emotional and behavioural wellbeing from 4 to 7 years: a community-based study.Language disorder (LD) and social-emotional and behavioural (SEB) difficulties are common childhood problems that often co-occur. While there is clear evidence of these associations from clinical samples, less is known about community samples. This paper examines these associations in children aged 4-7 years from a community-based longitudinal study. 771 families provided questionnaire and assessment data at 4, 5 and 7 years. Parent-reported SEB difficulties were measured at each point (SDQ). Child language was directly assessed at 4 (CELF-P2), 5 and 7 years (CELF-4). Linear regression analysis was used to compare cross-sectional differences in mean SDQ scores between children with and without LD at each time point. Linear regression was then used to examine how patterns of language development (language disordered at three time points; never disordered; disordered at one or two time points, i.e. 'unstable' group) related to SEB difficulties at each age, adjusted for potential confounders, as in the previous analyses. Higher hyperactivity/inattention scores were associated with LD at each age. In fully adjusted models, there was little difference in mean emotional symptoms scores between children with and without LD. The 'never' LD group had lower mean SDQ scores at each time point than the 'unstable' group. Findings highlight that children with persistent LD from preschool to early primary school may be more likely to have concomitant SEB difficulties, particularly behavioural difficulties. Those with unstable LD may also have co-occurring SEB difficulties, showing a need for education and health professionals to monitor early language and SEB development.
Specific effects of Working_Memory_ASDPTO training on the reading skills of Chinese children with developmental Dyslexia_HP.Most research on Working_Memory_ASDPTO (WM) training for children with developmental Dyslexia_HP (DD) has focused on western alphabetical languages. Moreover, most of these studies used a combination of training tasks targeting a variety of WM components, making it difficult to determine whether WM training generates a general improvement in overall reading, or improves specific cognitive skills corresponding to the WM components that are targeted in training. We tested the general and specific effects of WM training on the reading skills of 45 Chinese children with DD, grades 3 to 5. In Experiment 1, the experimental group received a program targeting the verbal WM component; in Experiment 2, the experimental group was trained with a program targeting visuospatial WM. In both experiments the control group played a placebo video game. In Experiment 1, the experimental group outperformed the control group on the visual rhyming task, which is highly correlated with verbal WM. In Experiment 2, the experimental group outperformed the control group on the orthographic awareness test, which is highly correlated with visuospatial WM. Furthermore, in both Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, the experimental groups outperformed the control groups on the fast word naming test, which is highly related to both visuospatial WM and verbal WM. Results indicated that WM training improved specific reading-related cognitive skills that are highly correlated with the specific WM components that were the target of training.

Altered Structural Connectivity of the Left_HP Visual Thalamus in Developmental Dyslexia_HP.Developmental Dyslexia_HP is a highly prevalent reading disorder affecting about 5%-10% of children [1]. It is characterized by slow and/or inaccurate word recognition skills as well as by poor spelling and decoding abilities [2]. Partly due to technical challenges with investigating subcortical sensory structures, current research on Dyslexia_HP in humans by and large focuses on the cerebral cortex [3-7]. These studies found that Dyslexia_HP is typically associated with functional and structural alterations of a distributed Left_HP-hemispheric cerebral cortex network (e.g., [8, 9]). However, findings from animal models and post mortem studies in humans suggest that Dyslexia_HP might also be associated with structural alterations in subcortical sensory pathways [10-14] (reviewed in [7]). Whether these alterations also exist in Dyslexia_HP in vivo and how they relate to Dyslexia_HP symptoms is currently unknown. Here, we used ultra-high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion MRI, and probabilistic tractography to investigate the structural connections of the visual sensory pathway in Dyslexia_HP in vivo. We discovered that individuals with Dyslexia_HP have reduced structural connections in the direct pathway between the Left_HP visual thalamus (Lateral_HP geniculate nucleus [LGN]) and Left_HP middle temporal area V5/MT, but not between the Left_HP LGN and Left_HP primary visual cortex. In addition, Left_HP V5/MT-LGN connectivity strength correlated with rapid naming abilities-a key deficit in Dyslexia_HP [15]. These findings provide the first evidence of specific structural alterations in the connections between the sensory thalamus and cortex in developmental Dyslexia_HP. The results challenge current standard models and provide novel evidence for the importance of cortico-thalamic interactions in explaining Dyslexia_HP.

The impact of developmental Dyslexia_HP and Dysgraphia_HP on movement production during word writing.This study investigated how deficits in orthographic processing Affect_ASDPTO movement production during word writing. Children with Dyslexia_HP and Dysgraphia_HP wrote words and pseudo-words on a digitizer. The words were orthographically regular and irregular of varying Frequency_HP. The group analysis revealed that writing irregular words and pseudo-words increased movement duration and dysfluency. This indicates that the spelling processes were active while the children were writing the words. The impact of these spelling processes was stronger for the children with Dyslexia_HP and Dysgraphia_HP. The analysis of individual performance revealed that most dyslexic/dysgraphic children presented similar writing patterns. However, selective lexical processing deficits Affect_ASDPTOed irregular word writing but not pseudo-word writing. Selective poor sublexical processing Affect_ASDPTOed pseudo-word writing more than irregular word writing. This study suggests that the interaction between orthographic and motor processing constitutes an important cognitive load that may disrupt the graphic outcome of the children with Dyslexia_HP/Dysgraphia_HP.

Longitudinal interactions between brain and cognitive measures on reading development from 6 months to 14 years.Dyslexia_HP is a neurobiological disorder impairing learning to read. Brain responses of infants at genetic risk for Dyslexia_HP are abnormal already at birth, and associations from infant speech perception to preschool cognitive skills and reading in early school years have been documented, but there are no studies showing predicting power until adolescence. Here we show that in at-risk infants, brain activation to pseudowords at Left_HP hemisphere predicts 44% of reading speed at 14 years, and even improves the prediction after taking into account neurocognitive preschool measures of letter naming, phonology, and verbal short-term memory. The association between infant brain responses and reading speed is mediated by preschool rapid automatized naming ability. Therefore, we suggest that rapid naming and reading speed could share a similar cognitive process of automatized access to lexicon via phonological representations, and brain activation to speech sounds in infancy probably acts as an index of deficient development of the same process.

Does the late positive component reflect successful reading acquisition? A longitudinal ERP study.Developmental Dyslexia_HP is a reading disorder that is associated with deficits in phonological processing, where the exact neural basis for those processing deficits remains unclear. In particular, disagreement exists whether degraded phonological representations or an impaired access to the phonological representations causes these deficits. To investigate this question and to trace changes in neurophysiology during the process of reading acquisition, we designed a longitudinal study with event related potentials (ERPs) in children between kindergarten and second grade. We used an explicit word processing task to elicit the late positive component (LPC), which has been shown to reflect phonological processing. A brain-wide analysis of the LPC with an electrode-wise application of mixed effects models showed significantly attenuated amplitudes in the Left_HP temporo-parietal region in dyslexic children. Since these differences were only present in the word and not in the picture (i.e. control) condition, the attenuated amplitudes might reflect impaired access to the phonological representations of words. This was further confirmed by the longitudinal development, which showed a rapid increase in amplitude at the beginning of reading instruction and a decrease with continuing automatization, possibly pointing to a progression from grapheme-phoneme parsing to whole word reading. Our longitudinal study provides the first evidence that it is possible to detect neurophysiological differences in the LPC between children with Dyslexia_HP and control children in both preliterate and very early stages of reading acquisition, providing new insights about the neurophysiological development and a potential marker of later reading problems.

Screening Protocol for Early Identification of Brazilian Children at Risk for Dyslexia_HP.Early identification of students at risk of Dyslexia_HP has been an educational challenge in the past years. This research had two main goals. First, we aimed to develop a screening protocol for early identification of Brazilian children at risk for Dyslexia_HP; second, we aimed to identify the predictive variables of this protocol using Principal Component Analysis. The major step involved in developing this protocol was the selection of variables, which were chosen based on the literature review and linguistic criteria. The screening protocol was composed of seven cognitive-linguistic skills: Letter naming; Phonological Awareness (which comprises the following subtests: Rhyme production, Rhyme identification, Syllabic segmentation, Production of words from a given phoneme, Phonemic Synthesis, and Phonemic analysis); Phonological Working_Memory_ASDPTO, Rapid naming Speed; Silent reading; Reading of words and non-words; and Auditory Comprehension of sentences from pictures. A total of 149 children, aged from 6 years to 6 and 11, of both genders who were enrolled in the 1st grade of elementary public schools were submitted to the screening protocol. Principal Component Analysis revealed four factors, accounting for 64.45% of the variance of the Protocol variables: first factor ("pre-reading"), second factor ("decoding"), third factor ("Reading"), and fourth factor "Auditory processing." The factors found corroborate those reported in the National and International literature and have been described as early signs of Dyslexia_HP and reading problems.

Effects of Phonological Training on the Reading and Reading-Related Abilities of Hong Kong Children with Dyslexia_HP.This study aimed to investigate phonological awareness training by examining outcomes among Chinese children who learn Chinese without phonetic system training. Fifty-six Hong Kong children from the 3rd to 6th grades were recruited. Two-thirds of the children had been officially identified as dyslexic by the local government, and the remainder were considered high risk for Dyslexia_HP. The children were divided equally into a control group and an experimental group, with the groups matched as closely as possible by age and gender. Children in the experimental group were trained by Onset_HP-rime-level phonological training. The training lasted ~3 weeks, with 15 daily sessions lasting ~20 min each. Our results indicated that children in the experimental group made significant improvements in Chinese character reading, Onset_HP awareness, rime awareness, and rapid naming after training. The association between phonological awareness and Chinese character reading, especially the association between rime awareness and Chinese character reading, also changed after training. The benefits of phonological awareness training were more obvious for children younger than 10 years old. The results of the present study can be extended to provide another approach to Chinese learning for children suffering from reading difficulties who are not responding to the usual approach in their region.

Morpheme-Based Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO in Spanish Children with Dyslexia_HP.It has been well documented that morphemic structure (roots and affixes) have an impact in reading, but effects seem to depend on the reading experience of readers and lexical characteristics of the stimuli. Specifically, it has been reported that morphemes constitute reading units for developing readers and children with Dyslexia_HP when they encounter a new word. In addition, recent studies have stated that the effect of morphology is also present in spelling, as morphological information facilitates spelling accuracy and influences handwriting times. The goal of this study was to investigate the role of morphology in reading and spelling fluency in Spanish children with Dyslexia_HP. For that purpose, a group of 24 children with Dyslexia_HP was compared with an age-matched group of 24 children without reading disabilities in performing a word naming task and a spelling-to-dictation task of isolated words. Morphological condition (high Frequency_HP base, low Frequency_HP base, simple) and lexicality (words vs. pseudowords) were manipulated. We considered, for the naming task, reading latencies, reading durations, reading critical segment (three first phonemes) durations and naming accuracy; and, for the spelling task, written latencies, writing durations for the whole word, writing critical segment (three first letters) durations and spelling accuracy. Results showed that Spanish children (with and without Dyslexia_HP) benefit from a high Frequency_HP base to initiate Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO responses, showing that they are familiar with the letter chunks that constitute a morpheme. In addition, base Frequency_HP impacts reading critical segment duration only for children with Dyslexia_HP, but for both groups in writing. In summary, children with Dyslexia_HP benefit from a high Frequency_HP base to read and spell unfamiliar stimuli.

Late Talkers: Why the Wait-and-See Approach Is Outdated.From a speech-language pathology perspective, there is a gap in interprofessional education/practice (IPE/IPP) that leads to a wait-and-see approach with late talkers (LT). In line with the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association's Strategic Pathway to Excellence, this article attempts to bridge the gap, reexamining the panoptic view that most LT "catch up" to their peers. The LT who persist with Language_impairment_HP should not be overlooked. Late talking can impact socialization and school readiness, and can place some toddlers at risk for life-long disability. Each state's early intervention program has an established IPP infrastructure. Parent-implemented intervention addresses risks and maximizes protective factors.

 and Dyslexia_HP is a specific learning disorder affecting reading and spelling abilities. Its prevalence is ~5% in German-speaking individuals. Although the etiology of Dyslexia_HP largely remains to be determined, comprehensive evidence supports deficient phonological processing as a major contributing factor. An important prerequisite for phonological processing is auditory discrimination and, thus, essential for acquiring reading and spelling skills. The event-related potential Mismatch Response (MMR) is an indicator for auditory discrimination capabilities with dyslexics showing an altered late component of MMR in response to auditory input.

Dyslexie font does not benefit reading in children with or without Dyslexia_HP.In two experiments, the claim was tested that the font "Dyslexie", specifically designed for people with Dyslexia_HP, eases reading performance of children with (and without) Dyslexia_HP. Three questions were investigated. (1) Does the Dyslexie font lead to faster and/or more accurate reading? (2) Do children have a preference for the Dyslexie font? And, (3) is font preference related to reading performance? In Experiment 1, children with Dyslexia_HP (n = 170) did not read text written in Dyslexie font faster or more accurately than in Arial font. The majority preferred reading in Arial and preference was not related to reading performance. In Experiment 2, children with (n = 102) and without Dyslexia_HP (n = 45) read word lists in three different font types (Dyslexie, Arial, Times New Roman). Words written in Dyslexie font were not read faster or more accurately. Moreover, participants showed a preference for the fonts Arial and Times New Roman rather than Dyslexie, and again, preference was not related to reading performance. These experiments clearly justify the conclusion that the Dyslexie font neither benefits nor impedes the reading process of children with and without Dyslexia_HP.

Attentional asymmetry between visual hemifields is related to habitual direction of reading and its implications for debate on cause and effects of Dyslexia_HP.A major controversy regarding Dyslexia_HP is whether any of the many visual and phonological deficits found to be correlated with reading difficulty cause the impairment or result from the reduced amount of reading done by dyslexics. We studied this question by comparing a visual capacity in the Left_HP and Right_HP visual hemifields in people habitually reading scripts written Right_HP-to-Left_HP or Left_HP-to-Right_HP. Selective visual attention is necessary for efficient visual search and also for the sequential recognition of letters in words. Because such attentional allocation during reading depends on the direction in which one is reading, asymmetries in search efficiency may reflect biases arising from the habitual direction of reading. We studied this by examining search performance in three cohorts: (a) Left_HP-to-Right_HP readers who read English fluently; (b) Right_HP-to-Left_HP readers fluent in reading Farsi but not any Left_HP-to-Right_HP script; and (c) bilingual readers fluent in English and in Farsi, Arabic, or Hebrew. Left_HP-to-Right_HP readers showed better search performance in the Right_HP hemifield and Right_HP-to-Left_HP readers in the Left_HP hemifield, but bilingual readers showed no such asymmetries. Thus, reading experience biases search performance in the direction of reading, which has implications for the cause and effect relationships between reading and cognitive functions.

We studied this question by comparing a visual capacity in the left and right visual hemifields in people habitually reading scripts written right-to-left or left-to-right. Selective visual attention is necessary for efficient visual search and also for the sequential recognition of letters in words. Because such attentional allocation during reading depends on the direction in which one is reading, asymmetries in search efficiency may reflect biases arising from the habitual direction of reading. We studied this by examining search performance in three cohorts: (a) left-to-right readers who read English fluently; (b) right-to-left readers fluent in reading Farsi but not any left-to-right script; and (c) bilingual readers fluent in English and in Farsi, Arabic, or Hebrew. Left_HP-to-right readers showed better search performance in the right hemifield and right-to-left readers in the left hemifield, but bilingual readers showed no such asymmetries. Thus, reading experience biases search performance in the direction of reading, which has implications for the cause and effect relationships between reading and cognitive functions.

The relationship between emotional experience with Dyslexia_HP and work self-efficacy among adults with Dyslexia_HP.This study responds to a call for more research on working adults with Dyslexia_HP investigating how employment-related factors Affect_ASDPTO and relate to one another. Two important work-related factors are self-efficacy and emotional experience with Dyslexia_HP. Work self-efficacy is viewed one of the most vital intrapersonal capacities in the work environment. It can be viewed as a subjective indicator of work success and is conceptualized as a multidimensional construct. Research speaks to a unique emotional experience stemming from living with an often misunderstood and stereotyped learning difference. The participants were 173 working adults with Dyslexia_HP (average age = 43.5 years, females = 56.6%) who participated in a web-based survey. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that more negative or uncomfortable emotions emanating from living with Dyslexia_HP predicted lower levels of total work self-efficacy, work attributes, work competency, and work Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP over and beyond background contextual variables. Implications of these findings are discussed.

Evaluation of visual motion perception ability in mice with knockout of the Dyslexia_HP candidate susceptibility gene Dcdc2.Developmental Dyslexia_HP is a heritable disability characterized by difficulties in learning to read and write. The neurobiological and genetic mechanisms underlying Dyslexia_HP remain poorly understood; however, several Dyslexia_HP candidate risk genes have been identified. One of these candidate risk genes-doublecortin domain containing 2 (DCDC2)-has been shown to play a role in neuronal migration and cilia function. At a behavioral level, variants of DCDC2 have been associated with impairments in phonological processing, Working_Memory_ASDPTO and reading speed. Additionally, a specific mutation in DCDC2 has been strongly linked to deficits in motion perception-a skill subserving reading abilities. To further explore the relationship between DCDC2 and Dyslexia_HP, a genetic knockout (KO) of the rodent homolog of DCDC2 (Dcdc2) was created. Initial studies showed that Dcdc2 KOs display deficits in auditory processing and Working_Memory_ASDPTO. The current study was designed to evaluate the association between DCDC2 and motion perception, as these skills have not yet been assessed in the Dcdc2 KO mouse model. We developed a novel motion perception task, utilizing touchscreen technology and operant conditioning. Dcdc2 KOs displayed deficits on the Pairwise Discrimination task specifically as motion was added to visual stimuli. Following behavioral assessment, brains were histologically prepared for neuroanatomical analysis of the Lateral_HP geniculate nucleus (LGN). The cumulative distribution showed that Dcdc2 KOs exhibited more small neurons and fewer larger neurons in the LGN. Results compliment findings that DCDC2 genetic alteration results in anomalies in visual motion pathways in a subpopulation of dyslexic patients.

Evaluation of the psychometric properties of "the Norwegian screening test for Dyslexia_HP".The aim of this study was to develop and investigate the psychometric properties of a screening protocol for Norwegian students in upper secondary school. The protocol was designed to assess skills that are at stake in Dyslexia_HP. It was administered to 232 students. In the absence of a "gold standard," comparisons were made between students who reported normal literacy skills (n = 184) and literacy problems (n = 48). Significant group differences were found across all areas. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses demonstrated good discriminatory power. The screening protocol met the standards for reliability and validity. It has the potential to be a useful tool for teachers to identify students at risk for Dyslexia_HP and who thus need to be referred to a full diagnostic investigation.

Association study of FGF18 with developmental Dyslexia_HP in Chinese population.Developmental Dyslexia_HP (DD) is a neurobiological disorder featured by reading disabilities. In recent years, genome-wide approaches provided new perspectives to discover novel candidate genes of DD. In a previous study, rs9313548 located downstream of FGF18 showed Borderline_HP genome-wide significant association with DD. Herein, we selected rs9313548 and 11 independent tag single nucleotide polymorphisms covering gene region of FGF18 to perform association analysis with DD among 978 Chinese dyslexic cases and 998 controls recruited from elementary schools. However, we did not observe any single nucleotide polymorphism exceeding significant threshold. Our preliminary results suggested that FGF18 might not be a susceptibility gene for DD in Chinese population.

Atypical Structural Asymmetry of the Planum Temporale is Related to Family_history_HP of Dyslexia_HP.Research on the neural correlates of developmental Dyslexia_HP indicates atypical anatomical lateralization of the planum temporale, a higher-order cortical auditory region. Yet whether this atypical lateralization precedes reading acquisition and is related to a familial risk for Dyslexia_HP is not currently known. In this study, we address these questions in 2 separate cohorts of young children and adolescents with and without a familial risk for Dyslexia_HP. Planum temporale surface area was manually labeled bilaterally, on the T1-weighted MR brain images of 54 pre-readers (mean age: 6.2 years, SD: 3.2 months; 33 males) and 28 adolescents (mean age: 14.7 years, SD: 3.3 months; 11 males). Half of the pre-readers and adolescents had a familial risk for Dyslexia_HP. In both pre-readers and adolescents, group comparisons of Left_HP and Right_HP planum temporale surface area showed a significant interaction between hemisphere and Family_history_HP of Dyslexia_HP, with participants who had no family risk for Dyslexia_HP showing greater Left_HPward asymmetry of the planum temporale. This effect was confirmed when analyses were restricted to normal reading participants. Altered planum temporale asymmetry thus seems to be related to Family_history_HP of Dyslexia_HP.

Comparing the Effect of Thinking Maps Training Package Developed by the Thinking Maps Method on the Reading Performance of Dyslexic Students.The present study aimed to develop the thinking maps training package and compare its training effect with the thinking maps method on the reading performance of second and fifth grade of elementary school male dyslexic students. For this mixed method exploratory study, from among the above mentioned grades' students in Isfahan, 90 students who met the inclusion criteria were selected by multistage sampling and randomly assigned into six experimental and control groups. The data were collected by reading and Dyslexia_HP test and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-fourth edition. The results of covariance analysis indicated a significant difference between the reading performance of the experimental (thinking maps training package and thinking maps method groups) and control groups ([Formula: see text]). Moreover, there were significant differences between the thinking maps training package group and thinking maps method group in some of the subtests ([Formula: see text]). It can be concluded that thinking maps training package and the thinking maps method exert a positive influence on the reading performance of dyslexic students; therefore, thinking maps can be used as an effective training and treatment method.

Co-morbidities in Chinese children with Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_HP/Hyperactivity_HP disorder and reading disabilities.The co-morbidity of Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_HP/Hyperactivity_HP disorder (ADHD) and reading disorder (RD) is more Frequent_HP than expected. This investigation assessed the potential uniqueness of the co-morbidity of ADHD and RD and extended existing findings to the Chinese language. A parallel group design with a post hoc analysis of group differences was employed to compare 4 groups of children (30 with ADHD, 33 with RD, 28 with ADHD + RD, and 30 typically developing) regarding their reading comprehension, attention, reading-related abilities, and cognitive abilities. The findings indicated that children with RD and/or ADHD symptom(s) exhibited diverse cognitive profiles, and the distinguishing factor contributed to different inhibitions. Additionally, Chinese-speaking children with the co-morbid symptoms of RD and ADHD demonstrated greater deficits in auditory Working_Memory_ASDPTO and rapid naming than did the pure-deficit groups. Furthermore, although problems with phonological awareness were similar between the 2 groups, the deficiency of orthographic knowledge was more Severe_HP in children with RD than in the co-morbid group. The ADHD + RD group's cognitive and reading-related abilities displayed a relatively complicated pattern that should be considered in the Diagnosis_ASDPTO of either RD or ADHD and their remediation design.

The visual attention span deficit in Chinese children with reading fluency difficulty.With reading development, some children fail to learn to read fluently. However, reading fluency difficulty (RFD) has not been fully investigated. The present study explored the underlying mechanism of RFD from the aspect of visual attention span. Fourteen Chinese children with RFD and fourteen age-matched normal readers participated. The visual 1-back task was adopted to examine visual attention span. Reaction time and accuracy were recorded, and relevant d-prime (d') scores were computed. Results showed that children with RFD exhibited lower accuracy and lower d' values than the controls did in the visual 1-back task, revealing a visual attention span deficit. Further analyses on d' values revealed that the attention distribution seemed to exhibit an inverted U-shaped pattern without lateralization for normal readers, but a W-shaped pattern with a rightward bias for children with RFD, which was discussed based on between-group variation in reading strategies. Results of the correlation analyses showed that visual attention span was associated with reading fluency at the sentence level for normal readers, but was related to reading fluency at the single-character level for children with RFD. The different patterns in correlations between groups revealed that visual attention span might be Affected_HP by the variation in reading strategies. The current findings extend previous data from alphabetic languages to Chinese, a logographic language with a particularly deep orthography, and have implications for reading-dysfluency remediation.

Neurobiological Bases of Reading Disorder Part II: The Importance of Developmental Considerations in Typical and Atypical Reading.Decoding-based reading disorder (RD; aka developmental Dyslexia_HP) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders, affecting approximately 5-10% of school-aged children across languages. Even though neuroimaging studies suggest an impairment of the Left_HP reading network in RD, the Onset_HP of this deficit and its developmental course, which may include constancy and change, is largely unknown. There is now growing evidence that the recruitment of brain networks underlying perceptual, cognitive and linguistic processes relevant to reading acquisition varies with age. These age-dependent changes may in turn impact the neurocognitive characteristics of RD observed at specific developmental stages. Here we synthesize findings from functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies to increase our understanding of the developmental time course of the neural bases underlying (a)typical reading. We first provide an overview of the brain bases of typical and atypical (impaired) reading. Next we describe how the understanding of RD can be deepened through scientific attention to age effects, for example, by integrating findings from cross-sectional studies of RD at various ages. Finally, we accent findings from extant longitudinal studies that directly examine developmental reading trajectories beginning in the preliterate stage at both group and individual levels. Although science is at the very early stage of understanding developmental aspects of neural deficits in RD, evidence to date characterizes RD by atypical brain maturation. We know that reading impairment may adversely impact multiple life domains such as academic achievement and social relationships, and unfortunately, that these negative outcomes can persist and compound into adulthood. We contend that exploring the developmental trajectories of RD will contribute to a greater understanding of how neural systems support reading acquisition. Further, we propose and cite evidence that the etiology of RD can be better investigated by distinguishing primary deficits from secondary impairments unfolding along development. These exciting and modern investigatory efforts can also indirectly contribute to a centered practice of early and accurate identification and optimal intervention to support the development of foundational pre-literacy skills and fluent reading. In sum, integrating a developmental understanding into the science and practice of reading acquisition and intervention is both possible and necessary.

Validation of a Screening Tool for Learning Disorder in Children.Learning disorder (LD) is a common cause for poor academic performance among school students. Poor detection of this may be due to lack of proper validated diagnostic and screening tools, leading to considerable difficulty for Affected_HP children and their families. This study aims to validate a screening tool developed by us among students with poor scholastic performance. It is an easy-to-use tool that can be used by parents or teachers. Preliminary validation was done earlier using case-control design among 100 students, and the results were encouraging.

Unstable Binocular Fixation Affects Reaction Times But Not Implicit Motor Learning in Dyslexia_HP.Individuals with developmental Dyslexia_HP suffer not only from reading problems as more general motor deficits can also be observed in this patient group. Both psychometric clinical tests and objective eyetracking methods suggest that unstable binocular fixation may contribute to reading problems. Because binocular instability may cause poor eye-hand coordination and impair motor control, the primary aim of this study was to explore in dyslexic subjects the influence of unstable binocular fixation on reaction times (RTs) and implicit motor learning (IML), which is one of the fundamental cerebellar functions.

Dyslexia_HP as a multi-deficit disorder: Working_Memory_ASDPTO and auditory temporal processing.Dyslexia_HP is difficulty in acquiring reading skills despite adequate intelligence and sufficient reading opportunities. Its origin is still under debate. Studies usually focus on a singular cause for Dyslexia_HP; however, some researchers argue that Dyslexia_HP reflects multiple deficits. Two of the abilities under investigation in Dyslexia_HP are Working_Memory_ASDPTO (WM) and auditory temporal processing (ATP). In order to better evaluate the relative roles of WM and ATP in Dyslexia_HP, in the present study, we tested the contribution of WM and ATP to different types of reading performance and phonological awareness in Dyslexia_HP, using a multidimensional approach. Seventy-eight adults with Dyslexia_HP and 23 normal-reading adults performed WM and ATP tasks, as well as reading and phonological awareness tests. Readers with Dyslexia_HP showed poorer performance on all tests. Both WM and ATP were significant predictors of reading performance and phonological awareness among participants with Dyslexia_HP. Dividing participants with Dyslexia_HP according to their performance level on WM and ATP tasks revealed group differences in reading and phonological awareness tests. Both WM and ATP contribute to Dyslexia_HP, and varying levels of difficulties in both of these abilities are observed among this population. This is strong evidence in favor of the multi-deficit approach in Dyslexia_HP, and suggests that researchers should consider this approach in future studies of Dyslexia_HP.

Tracking the effects of Dyslexia_HP in reading and spelling development: A longitudinal study of Greek readers.In this study, we followed Greek children with and without Dyslexia_HP for 18 months, assessing them twice on a battery of phonological, reading, and spelling tasks, aiming to document the relative progress achieved and to uncover any specific effects of Dyslexia_HP in the development of reading and spelling beyond the longitudinal associations among variables that are observed in typical readers. A wide-ranging match was achieved between the dyslexic group and the younger reading-matched comparison group, enabling longitudinal comparisons on essentially identical initial performance profiles. Group differences were found in the development of tasks relying on phonological processing skill, such as phoneme deletion in pseudowords, pseudoword reading accuracy and time, as well as in graphemic spelling accuracy. The results confirm findings from cross-sectional studies of reading difficulty in the relatively transparent Greek orthography and are consistent with a phonological processing deficit underlying and reciprocally interacting with underdevelopment of reading and spelling skills in the impaired population.

Neither action nor phonological video games make dyslexic children read better.The prevalence and long-term consequences of Dyslexia_HP make it crucial to look for effective and efficient ways of its therapy. Action video games (AVG) were implied as a possible remedy for difficulties in reading in Italian and English-speaking children. However, the studies examining the effectiveness of AVG application in Dyslexia_HP suffered from significant methodological weaknesses such as small sample sizes and lack of a control group with no intervention. In our study, we tested how two forms of training: based on AVG and on phonological non-action video games (PNAVG), Affect_ASDPTO reading in a group of fifty-four Polish children with Dyslexia_HP. Both speed and accuracy of reading increased in AVG as much as in PNAVG group. Moreover, both groups improved in phonological awareness, selective attention and rapid naming. Critically, the reading progress in the two groups did not differ from a dyslexic control group which did not participate in any training. Thus, the observed improvement in reading in AVG and PNAVG can be attributed either to the normal reading development related to schooling or to test practice effect. Overall, we failed to replicate previous studies: Neither AVG nor PNAVG remedy difficulties in reading in school children.

Pathways Into Literacy: The Role of Early Oral Language Abilities and Family Risk for Dyslexia_HP.The present study investigated the role of early oral language and family risk for Dyslexia_HP in the two developmental pathways toward reading comprehension, through word reading and through oral language abilities. The sample contained 237 children (164 at family risk for Dyslexia_HP) from the Dutch Dyslexia_HP Program. Longitudinal data were obtained on seven occasions when children were between 4 and 12 years old. The relationship between early oral Language_Ability_ASDPTO and reading comprehension at the age of 12 years was mediated by preliteracy skills and word-decoding ability for the first pathway and by later language abilities for the second pathway. Family risk influenced literacy development through its subsequent relations with preliteracy skills, word decoding, and reading comprehension. Although performance on language measures was often lower for the family-risk group than for the no-family-risk group, family risk did not have a specific relation with either early or later oral language abilities.

Hemispheric asymmetries in the orientation and location of the Lateral_HP geniculate nucleus in Dyslexia_HP.Human brain asymmetry reflects normal specialization of functional roles and may derive from evolutionary, hereditary, developmental, experiential, and pathological factors (Toga & Thompson, 2003). Geschwind and Galaburda (1985) suggested that processing difficulties in Dyslexia_HP are due to structural differences between hemispheres. Because of its potential significance to the controversial magnocellular theory of Dyslexia_HP, we investigated hemispheric differences in the human Lateral_HP geniculate nucleus (LGN), the primary visual relay and control nucleus in the thalamus, in subjects with Dyslexia_HP compared to normal readers. We acquired and averaged multiple high-resolution proton density (PD) weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumes to measure in detail the anatomical boundaries of the LGN in each hemisphere. We observed hemispheric asymmetries in the orientation of the nucleus in subjects with Dyslexia_HP that were absent in controls. We also found differences in the location of the LGN between hemispheres in controls but not in subjects with Dyslexia_HP. Neither the precise anatomical differences in the LGN nor their functional consequences are known, nor is it clear whether the differences might be causes or effects of Dyslexia_HP.

What is Developmental Dyslexia_HP?Until the 1950s, developmental Dyslexia_HP was defined as a hereditary visual disability, selectively affecting reading without compromising oral or non-verbal Reasoning_ASDPTO skills. This changed radically after the development of the phonological theory of Dyslexia_HP; this not only ruled out any role for visual processing in its aetiology, but it also cast doubt on the use of discrepancy between reading and Reasoning_ASDPTO skills as a criterion for diagnosing it. Here I argue that this theory is set at too high a cognitive level to be explanatory; we need to understand the pathophysiological visual and auditory mechanisms that cause children's phonological problems. I discuss how the 'magnocellular theory' attempts to do this in terms of slowed and error prone temporal processing which leads to dyslexics' defective visual and auditory sequencing when attempting to read. I attempt to deal with the criticisms of this theory and show how it leads to a number of successful ways of helping dyslexic children to overcome their reading difficulties.

Ancestral Variations of the PCDHG Gene Cluster Predispose to Dyslexia_HP in a Multiplex Family.Dyslexia_HP is a heritable neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties in Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO. In this study, we describe the identification of a set of 17 polymorphisms located across 1.9Mb region on chromosome 5q31.3, encompassing genes of the PCDHG cluster, TAF7, PCDH1 and ARHGAP26, dominantly inherited with Dyslexia_HP in a multi-incident family. Strikingly, the non-risk form of seven variations of the PCDHG cluster, are preponderant in the human lineage, while risk alleles are ancestral and conserved across Neanderthals to non-human primates. Four of these seven ancestral variations (c.460A>C [p.Ile154Leu], c.541G>A [p.Ala181Thr], c.2036G>C [p.Arg679Pro] and c.2059A>G [p.Lys687Glu]) result in amino acid alterations. p.Ile154Leu and p.Ala181Thr are present at EC2: EC3 interacting interface of γA3-PCDH and γA4-PCDH respectively might Affect_ASDPTO trans-homophilic interaction and hence neuronal connectivity. p.Arg679Pro and p.Lys687Glu are present within the linker region connecting trans-membrane to extracellular domain. Sequence analysis indicated the importance of p.Ile154, p.Arg679 and p.Lys687 in maintaining class specificity. Thus the observed association of PCDHG genes encoding neural adhesion proteins reinforces the hypothesis of aberrant neuronal connectivity in the pathophysiology of Dyslexia_HP. Additionally, the striking conservation of the identified variants indicates a role of PCDHG in the evolution of highly specialized cognitive skills critical to reading.

Development of a language screening instrument for Swedish 4-year-olds.The Swedish Program for health surveillance of preschool children includes screening of language and communication abilities. One important language screening is carried out at age 4 years as part of a general screening conducted by health nurses at child health centres. The instruments presently in use for this screening mainly focus on Expressive_Phonology_ASDPTO. This may result in both over-referral of children with phonological difficulties and under-referral of children with language disorders (LDs), involving difficulties with vocabulary, grammar and/or language comprehension. Previous research has proposed non-word repetition as a clinical marker for LD. It has also been found that higher predictive power is achieved when non-word repetition is combined with the assessment of lexical/semantic skills. Taking these findings into account, the construction of a language screening instrument may yield more adequate referrals to speech-language therapists (SLTs).

Auditory temporal perceptual learning and transfer in Chinese-speaking children with developmental Dyslexia_HP.Perceptual learning refers to the improvement of perceptual performance as a function of training. Recent studies found that auditory perceptual learning may improve phonological skills in individuals with developmental Dyslexia_HP in alphabetic writing system. However, whether auditory perceptual learning could also benefit the reading skills of those learning the Chinese logographic writing system is, as yet, unknown. The current study aimed to investigate the remediation effect of auditory temporal perceptual learning on Mandarin-speaking school children with developmental Dyslexia_HP. Thirty children with Dyslexia_HP were screened from a large pool of students in 3th-5th grades. They completed a series of pretests and then were assigned to either a non-training control group or a training group. The training group worked on a pure tone duration discrimination task for 7 sessions over 2 weeks with thirty minutes per session. Post-tests immediately after training and a follow-up test 2 months later were conducted. Analyses revealed a significant training effect in the training group relative to non-training group, as well as near transfer to the temporal interval discrimination task and far transfer to phonological awareness, character recognition and reading fluency. Importantly, the training effect and all the transfer effects were Stable_HP at the 2-month follow-up session. Further analyses found that a significant correlation between character recognition performance and learning rate mainly existed in the slow learning phase, the consolidation stage of perceptual learning, and this effect was modulated by an individuals' Executive_Function_ASDPTO. These findings indicate that adaptive auditory temporal perceptual learning can lead to learning and transfer effects on reading performance, and shed further light on the potential role of basic perceptual learning in the remediation and prevention of developmental Dyslexia_HP.

Paired associate learning deficits in poor readers: The contribution of phonological input and output processes.It is well-established that poor readers exhibit deficits in paired associate learning (PAL), and there is increasing evidence for a phonological locus of these deficits. However, it remains unclear whether poor performance stems from difficulties specific to the phonological output system or difficulties that Affect_ASDPTO both phonological input and output processes. Understanding these deficits is important not only in the context of PAL but also for informing broader theories of typical and atypical reading development. We developed a novel paradigm that allowed us to assess PAL in the presence and absence of phonological output demands. In total, 14 poor readers and 14 age-matched controls were first trained to criterion in verbal-visual PAL before being tested in the visual-verbal direction. The results showed that poor readers learned at the same rate as controls in verbal-visual PAL, even when the nonword stimuli were phonologically confusable. Yet, despite having reached the same criterion as controls in verbal-visual PAL, poor readers exhibited robust impairments for those same paired associates in visual-verbal PAL. The overall pattern of results is most consistent with the conclusion that PAL deficits reflect impairments to the phonological output system; however, results that may challenge this interpretation are also discussed.

The overall pattern of results is most consistent with the conclusion that PAL deficits reflect impairments to the phonological output system; however, results that may challenge this interpretation are also discussed.
Sluggish dorsally-driven inhibition of return during orthographic processing in adults with Dyslexia_HP.Dyslexia_HP (D) is a neurodevelopmental reading disorder characterized by phonological and orthographic deficits. Before phonological decoding, reading requires a specialized orthographic system for parallel letter processing that assigns letter identities to different spatial locations. The magnocellular-dorsal (MD) stream rapidly process the spatial location of visual stimuli controlling visuo-spatial attention. To investigate the visuo-spatial attention efficiency during orthographic processing, inhibition of return (IOR) was measured in adults with and without D in a lexical decision task. IOR is the delay in responding to stimuli displayed in a cued location after a long cue-target interval. Only adults with D did not showed IOR effect during letter-string recognition, despite the typical Left_HP-hemisphere specialization for word identification. A specific deficit in coherent-dot-motion perception confirmed an MD-stream disorder in adults with D. Our results suggest that adults with D might develop an efficient visual word form area, but a dorsal-attentional dysfunction impairs their reading fluency.

No evidence for systematic white matter correlates of Dyslexia_HP: An Activation Likelihood Estimation meta-analysis.Dyslexia_HP is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by reading and spelling difficulties. Beyond the behavioral and functional correlates of this condition, a growing number of studies have explored structural differences between individuals with Dyslexia_HP and typically developing individuals. To date, findings remain disparate - some studies suggest differences in fractional anisotropy (FA), an indirect measure of white matter integrity, whereas others do not identify significant disparities. Here, we synthesized the existing literature on this topic by conducting a meta-analysis of Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) studies investigating white matter correlates of Dyslexia_HP via voxel-based analyses (VBA) of FA. Our results showed no reliable clusters underlying differences between dyslexics and typical individuals, after correcting for multiple comparisons (false discovery rate correction). Because group comparisons might be too coarse to yield subtle differences, we further explored differences in FA as a function of reading ability, measured on a continuous scale. Consistent with our initial findings, reading ability was not associated with reliable differences in white matter integrity. These findings nuance the current view of Profound_HP, structural differences underlying reading ability and its associated disorders, and suggest that their neural correlates might be more subtle than previously thought.

Prefrontal mediation of the reading network predicts intervention response in Dyslexia_HP.A primary challenge facing the development of interventions for Dyslexia_HP is identifying effective predictors of intervention response. While behavioral literature has identified core cognitive characteristics of response, the distinction of reading versus executive cognitive contributions to response profiles remains unclear, due in part to the difficulty of segregating these constructs using behavioral outputs. In the current study we used functional neuroimaging to piece apart the mechanisms of how/whether executive and reading network relationships are predictive of intervention response. We found that readers who are responsive to intervention have more typical pre-intervention functional interactions between executive and reading systems compared to nonresponsive readers. These findings suggest that intervention response in Dyslexia_HP is influenced not only by domain-specific reading regions, but also by contributions from intervening domain-general networks. Our results make a significant gain in identifying predictive bio-markers of outcomes in Dyslexia_HP, and have important implications for the development of personalized clinical interventions.

Aberrant resting-state functional brain networks in Dyslexia_HP: Symbolic mutual information analysis of neuromagnetic signals.Neuroimaging studies have identified a variety of structural and functional connectivity abnormalities in students experiencing reading difficulties. The present study adopted a novel approach to assess the dynamics of resting-state neuromagnetic recordings in the form of symbolic sequences (i.e., repeated patterns of neuromagnetic fluctuations within and/or between sensors). Participants were 25 students experiencing Severe_HP reading difficulties (RD) and 27 age-matched non-impaired readers (NI) aged 7-14 years. Sensor-level data were first represented as symbolic sequences in eight conventional Frequency_HP bands. Next, dominant types of sensor-to-sensor interactions in the form of intra and cross-Frequency_HP coupling were computed and subjected to graph modeling to assess group differences in global network characteristics. As a group RD students displayed predominantly within-Frequency_HP interactions between neighboring sensors which may reflect reduced overall global network efficiency and cost-efficiency of information transfer. In contrast, sensor networks among NI students featured a higher proportion of cross-Frequency_HP interactions. Brain-reading achievement associations highlighted the role of Left_HP hemisphere temporo-parietal functional networks, at rest, for reading acquisition and ability.

No evidence for systematic white matter correlates of Dyslexia_HP and Dyscalculia_HP.Learning disabilities such as Dyslexia_HP, Dyscalculia_HP and their comorbid manifestation are prevalent, affecting as much as 15% of the population. Structural neuroimaging studies have indicated that these disorders can be related to differences in white matter integrity, although findings remain disparate. In this study, we used a unique design composed of individuals with Dyslexia_HP, Dyscalculia_HP, both disorders and controls, to systematically explore differences in fractional anisotropy across groups using diffusion tensor imaging. Specifically, we focused on the corona radiata and the arcuate fasciculus, two tracts associated with reading and mathematics in a number of previous studies. Using Bayesian hypothesis testing, we show that the present data favor the null model of no differences between groups for these particular tracts-a finding that seems to go against the current view but might be representative of the disparities within this field of research. Together, these findings suggest that structural differences associated with Dyslexia_HP and Dyscalculia_HP might not be as reliable as previously thought, with potential ramifications in terms of remediation.

Shorter cortical adaptation in Dyslexia_HP is broadly distributed in the superior temporal lobe and includes the primary auditory cortex.Studies of the performance of individuals with Dyslexia_HP in perceptual tasks suggest that their implicit inference of sound statistics is impaired. Previously, using two-tone Frequency_HP discrimination, we found that the effect of previous trials' frequencies on the judgments of individuals with Dyslexia_HP decays faster than the effect on controls' judgments, and that the adaptation (decrease of neural response to repeated stimuli) of their ERP responses to tones is shorter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jaffe-Dax et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we show the cortical distribution of these abnormal dynamics of adaptation using fast-acquisition fMRI. We find that faster decay of adaptation in Dyslexia_HP is widespread, although the most significant effects are found in the Left_HP superior temporal lobe, including the auditory cortex. This broad distribution suggests that the faster decay of implicit memory of individuals with Dyslexia_HP is a general characteristic of their cortical dynamics, which also affects sensory cortices.

Verbal task demands are key in explaining the relationship between paired-associate learning and reading ability.Paired-associate learning (PAL) tasks measure the ability to form a novel association between a stimulus and a response. Performance on such tasks is strongly associated with reading ability, and there is increasing evidence that verbal task demands may be critical in explaining this relationship. The current study investigated the relationships between different forms of PAL and reading ability. A total of 97 children aged 8-10 years completed a battery of reading assessments and six different PAL tasks (phoneme-phoneme, visual-phoneme, Absent_speech_HP-Absent_speech_HP, visual-Absent_speech_HP, nonword-nonword, and visual-nonword) involving both familiar phonemes and unfamiliar nonwords. A latent variable path model showed that PAL ability is captured by two correlated latent variables: auditory-articulatory and visual-articulatory. The auditory-articulatory latent variable was the stronger predictor of reading ability, providing support for a verbal account of the PAL-reading relationship.

The skills related to the early reading acquisition in Spain and Peru.This paper deals with the skills related to the early reading acquisition in two countries that share language. Traditionally on reading readiness research there is a great interest to find out what factors Affect_ASDPTO early reading ability, but differ from other academic skills that Affect_ASDPTO general school learnings. Furthermore, it is also known how the influence of pre-reading variables in two countries with the same language, Affect_ASDPTO the development of the reading. On the other hand, several studies have examined what skills are related to reading readiness (phonological awareness, alphabetic awareness, naming speed, linguistic skills, metalinguistic knowledge and basic cognitive processes), but there are no studies showing whether countries can also influence the development of these skills.Our main objective in this study was to establish whether there were differences in the degree of acquisition of these skills between Spanish (119 children) and Peruvian (128 children), five years old children assessed in their own countries and after controlling Economic, Social and Cultural Status (ESCS). The results show that there are significant differences in the degree of acquisition of these skills between these two samples. It's especially relevant, in these results, that the main predictor in a regression study was the country of origin, explaining a higher percentage of variance than other variables such as age differences, in months, or gender. These findings corroborate the results obtained in other studies with migrant population.

Are RAN deficits in university students with Dyslexia_HP due to defective lexical access, impaired anchoring, or slow articulation?The purpose of this study was to examine different hypotheses in relation to RAN deficits in Dyslexia_HP. Thirty university students with Dyslexia_HP and 32 chronological-age controls were assessed on RAN Digits and Colors as well as on two versions of RAN Letters and Objects (one with five items repeated 16 times and one with 20 items repeated four times). In addition, participants were tested on discrete letter and object naming, phonological awareness, orthographic knowledge, and speed of processing, and the RAN Letters and Objects total times were partitioned into pause times and articulation times. Results showed first that the Dyslexia_HP group was slower than the control group on all RAN tasks and the differences remained significant after controlling for discrete naming time. Second, both groups were slower in the large item set condition (20 × 4) than in the small set condition (5 × 16). Third, the Dyslexia_HP group was slower than the control group in both the pause and the articulation times. Although none of the processing skills was sufficient on its own to eliminate group differences in RAN Letters components, phonological awareness, and orthographic processing were sufficient on their own to eliminate group differences in the RAN Objects pause time. Taken together, our findings suggest that the deficits in RAN are not due to impaired anchoring, but rather due to subtle impairments in lexical access (specific to alphanumeric RAN), serial processing, and articulation.

Analyzing Global Components in Developmental Dyscalculia_HP and Dyslexia_HP.The study examined whether developmental deficits in reading and numerical skills could be expressed in terms of global factors by reference to the rate and amount (RAM) and difference engine (DEM) models. From a sample of 325 fifth grade children, we identified 5 children with Dyslexia_HP, 16 with Dyscalculia_HP, 7 with a "mixed pattern," and 49 control children. Children were asked to read aloud words presented individually that varied for Frequency_HP and length and to respond (either vocally or manually) to a series of simple number tasks (addition, subtraction, number reading, and number comparisons). Reaction times were measured. Results indicated that the deficit of children with Dyscalculia_HP and children with a mixed pattern on numerical tasks could be explained by a single global factor, similarly to the reading deficit shown by children with Dyslexia_HP. As predicted by the DEM, increases in task difficulty were accompanied by a corresponding increase in inter-individual variability for both the reading and numerical tasks. These relationships were constant across the four groups of children but differed in terms of slope and intercept on the

Difficulties of Drivers With Dyslexia_HP When Reading Traffic Signs: Analysis of Reading, Eye Gazes, and Driving Performance.A group of adult individuals with Dyslexia_HP and a matched group of normally reading individuals participated in a driving simulation experiment. Participants were asked to read the word presented on every direction traffic sign encountered along a route, as far as possible from the sign, maintaining driving performance. Word Frequency_HP and word length were manipulated as within-subject factors. We analyzed (a) reading accuracy, (b) how far the sign was when the participant started to give the response, (c) where the participant looked during the time leading up to the response, and (d) the variability of the vehicle's speed during that time and during driving on similar segments of the route that did not present the traffic signs. Individuals with Dyslexia_HP showed lower levels of performance in the reading task, the roles of word Frequency_HP and word length were more influential for them, and there was larger variability of the vehicle's speed during the time they were attempting to read the traffic sign, which did not occur during their driving on similar segments that did not present the targeted traffic signs. Therefore, the specific needs of individuals with Dyslexia_HP on the road should be considered in plans aimed at increasing traffic safety and fluidity.

Specific problems in visual cognition of dyslexic readers: Face discrimination deficits predict Dyslexia_HP over and above discrimination of scrambled faces and novel objects.Evidence of interdependencies of face and word processing mechanisms suggest possible links between reading problems and Abnormality_of_the_face_HP processing. In two experiments we assessed such high-level visual deficits in people with a history of reading problems. Experiment 1 showed that people who were worse at face matching had greater reading problems. In experiment 2, matched dyslexic and typical readers were tested, and difficulties with face matching were consistently found to predict Dyslexia_HP over and above both novel-object matching as well as matching noise patterns that shared low-level visual properties with faces. Furthermore, ADHD measures could not account for face matching problems. We speculate that reading difficulties in Dyslexia_HP are partially caused by specific deficits in high-level visual processing, in particular for visual object categories such as faces and words with which people have extensive experience.

Feedforward motor control in developmental Dyslexia_HP and developmental coordination disorder: Does comorbidity matter?Feedforward and online controls are two facets of predictive motor control from internal models, which is suspected to be impaired in Learning_Disorders_ASDPTO. We examined whether the feedforward component is Affected_HP in children (8-12 years) with developmental Dyslexia_HP (DD) and/or with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) compared to typically developing (TD) children.

Long-lasting improvement following tDCS treatment combined with a training for reading in children and adolescents with Dyslexia_HP.Noninvasive brain stimulation transiently modulates reading ability in individuals with Dyslexia_HP by facilitating the underactive neural pathways in them. However, its long-term effects have not been determined. This study confirmed the ameliorative effects of multiple sessions of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with a training for reading on the reading abilities of children and adolescents with Dyslexia_HP and examined whether they are long-lasting. Twenty-six children and adolescents with Dyslexia_HP received 3 20-min sessions per week for 6 weeks (18 sessions) of Left_HP anodal/Right_HP cathodal tDCS, set to 1 mA, over the parieto-temporal regions, combined with training for reading. The participants were randomly assigned to receive active or sham treatment. Reading measures (text, high- and low-Frequency_HP words, non-words) were recorded before and immediately after the treatment and 1 and 6 months later. The long-term tolerability to tDCS was also evaluated. The active group received long-lasting benefits in reading. Specifically, the non-word reading efficiency index improved at every time point, as did the low-Frequency_HP word reading efficiency index at 1 and 6 months after the end of the treatment. No differences emerged in the sham group. No long-term adverse effects were documented. This study provides evidence of persistent improvements in reading in children and adolescents with Dyslexia_HP, constituting a new rehabilitative approach for the remediation of Dyslexia_HP.

This study confirmed the ameliorative effects of multiple sessions of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with a training for reading on the reading abilities of children and adolescents with dyslexia and examined whether they are long-lasting. Twenty-six children and adolescents with dyslexia received 3 20-min sessions per week for 6 weeks (18 sessions) of left anodal/right cathodal tDCS, set to 1 mA, over the parieto-temporal regions, combined with training for reading. The participants were randomly assigned to receive active or sham treatment. Reading measures (text, high- and low-frequency words, non-words) were recorded before and immediately after the treatment and 1 and 6 months later. The long-term tolerability to tDCS was also evaluated. The active group received long-lasting benefits in reading. Specifically, the non-word reading efficiency index improved at every time point, as did the low-frequency word reading efficiency index at 1 and 6 months after the end of the treatment. No differences emerged in the sham group. No long-term adverse effects were documented. This study provides evidence of persistent improvements in reading in children and adolescents with dyslexia, constituting a new rehabilitative approach for the remediation of dyslexia.
Investigating the benefit of adding listening passage preview to repeated readings.Repeated readings (RR) and listening passage preview (LPP) are commonly used reading fluency interventions. However, relatively little is known about the Behavioral_abnormality_HP that occur in children's reading in response to these interventions and what reading behavior, if any, students engage in during LPP. As such, in the current study, 57 third-grade students were randomly assigned to either a RR or LPP + RR condition. Intervention effects were evaluated by measuring students' oral reading fluency and eye-movement (EM) behaviors. Results revealed similar outcomes across measures. Students in both conditions significantly increased their words read correctly per minute and decreased the number of errors made in reading, total fixation time, Frequency_HP of fixations, and percentage of words fixated. EM measures indicated students' reading improved particularly on low-Frequency_HP words because of a reduction in time spent on high-level text processing. Results have implications for the classroom as well as future EM research. (PsycINFO Database Record

Voxel-based lesion analysis of brain regions underlying Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO.The neural basis of Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO has been a source of inquiry as well as controversy in the neuroscience literature. Reading has been associated with both Left_HP posterior ventral temporal zones (termed the "visual word form area") as well as more dorsal zones, primarily in Left_HP parietal cortex. Writing has also been associated with Left_HP parietal cortex, as well as Left_HP sensorimotor cortex and prefrontal regions. Typically, the neural basis of Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO are examined in separate studies and/or rely on single case studies exhibiting specific deficits. Functional neuroimaging studies of Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO typically identify a large number of activated regions but do not necessarily identify the core, critical hubs. Last, due to constraints on the functional imaging environment, many previous studies have been limited to measuring the brain activity associated with single-word Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO, rather than sentence-level processing. In the current study, the brain correlates of Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO at both the single- and sentence-level were studied in a large sample of 111 individuals with a history of Chronic_HP Stroke_HP using voxel-based lesion symptom mapping (VLSM). VLSM provides a whole-brain, voxel-by-voxel statistical analysis of the role of distinct regions in a particular behavior by comparing performance of individuals with and without a lesion at every voxel. Rather than comparing individual cases or small groups with particular behavioral dissociations in Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO, VLSM allowed us to analyze data from a large, well-characterized sample of Stroke_HP patients exhibiting a wide range of Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO impairments. The VLSM analyses revealed that reading was associated with a critical Left_HP inferior temporo-occipital focus, while writing was primarily associated with the Left_HP supramarginal gyrus. Separate VLSM analyses of single-word versus sentence-level reading showed that sentence-level reading was uniquely associated with anterior to mid-portions of the middle and superior temporal gyri. Both single-word and sentence-level writing overlapped to a great extent in the Left_HP supramarginal gyrus, but sentence-level writing was associated with additional underlying white matter pathways such as the internal capsule. These findings suggest that critical aspects of Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO processes diverge, with reading relying critically on the ventral visual recognition stream and writing relying on a dorsal visuo-spatial-motor stream.

The modality and redundancy effects in multimedia learning in children with Dyslexia_HP.The present study aimed to examine the modality and redundancy effects in multimedia learning in children with Dyslexia_HP in order to find out whether their learning benefits from written and/or spoken text with pictures. We compared study time and knowledge gain in 26 11-year-old children with Dyslexia_HP and 38 typically reading peers in a within-subjects design. All children were presented with a series of user-paced multimedia lessons in 3 conditions: pictorial information presented with (a) written text, (b) audio, or (c) combined text and audio. We also examined whether children's learning outcomes were related to their Working_Memory_ASDPTO. With respect to study time, we found modality and reversed redundancy effects. Children with Dyslexia_HP spent more time learning in the text condition, compared with the audio condition and the combined text-and-audio condition. Regarding knowledge gain, no modality or redundancy effects were evidenced. Although the groups differed on Working_Memory_ASDPTO, it did not influence the modality or redundancy effect on study time or knowledge gain. In multimedia learning, it thus is more efficient to provide children with Dyslexia_HP with audio or with auditory support.

How phonological awareness mediates the relation between Working_Memory_ASDPTO and word reading efficiency in children with Dyslexia_HP.This study examined the relation between Working_Memory_ASDPTO, phonological awareness, and word reading efficiency in fourth-grade children with Dyslexia_HP. To test whether the relation between phonological awareness and word reading efficiency differed for children with Dyslexia_HP versus typically developing children, we assessed phonological awareness and word reading efficiency in 50 children with Dyslexia_HP (aged 9;10, 35 boys) and 613 typically developing children (aged 9;5, 279 boys). Phonological awareness was found to be associated with word reading efficiency, similar for children with Dyslexia_HP and typically developing children. To find out whether the relation between Working_Memory_ASDPTO and word reading efficiency in the group with Dyslexia_HP could be explained by phonological awareness, the children with Dyslexia_HP were also tested on Working_Memory_ASDPTO. Results of a mediation analysis showed a significant indirect effect of Working_Memory_ASDPTO on word reading efficiency via phonological awareness. Working_Memory_ASDPTO predicted reading efficiency, via its relation with phonological awareness in children with Dyslexia_HP. This indicates that Working_Memory_ASDPTO is necessary for word reading efficiency via its impact on phonological awareness and that phonological awareness continues to be important for word reading efficiency in older children with Dyslexia_HP.

What's in a name? Perspectives of Dyslexia_HP assessors working with students in the UK higher education sector.Research findings and positions concerning the nature of the Dyslexia_HP construct are currently diverse and increasingly complex. The ability of assessor practitioners to operationalize such knowledge and categorically diagnose Dyslexia_HP in any reliable and consistent way is being questioned. This study aimed to explore the way in which diverse and complex research findings are operationalized in the Dyslexia_HP diagnostic assessment of UK higher education students. The perspectives of 118 professional assessors of Dyslexia_HP working within the sector were collected using a questionnaire and some interviews. Data were analysed both quantitatively and qualitatively, as appropriate, and then integrated. The results confirmed critics' concerns about the consistency and reliability of the construct as currently diagnosed within the higher education context. Key controversial aspects of practice that emerged included the contextualized interpretation of literacy difficulties, a general commitment to discrepancy concepts, scepticism about the face validity of prescribed psychometric tests, and a related reliance on professional observation and experience above test results. The findings pointed to the need for a more informed nuanced understanding of the Dyslexia_HP label and a more cautious and responsible attitude towards its use.

Enhanced Sensitivity to Subphonemic Segments in Dyslexia_HP: A New Instance of Allophonic Perception.Although Dyslexia_HP can be individuated in many different ways, it has only three discernable sources: a visual deficit that affects the perception of letters, a phonological deficit that affects the perception of speech sounds, and an audio-visual deficit that disturbs the association of letters with speech sounds. However, the very nature of each of these core deficits remains debatable. The phonological deficit in Dyslexia_HP, which is generally attributed to a deficit of phonological awareness, might result from a specific mode of speech perception characterized by the use of allophonic (i.e., subphonemic) units. Here we will summarize the available evidence and present new data in support of the "allophonic theory" of Dyslexia_HP. Previous studies have shown that the Dyslexia_HP deficit in the categorical perception of phonemic features (e.g., the voicing contrast between /t/ and /d/) is due to the enhanced sensitivity to allophonic features (e.g., the difference between two variants of /d/). Another consequence of allophonic perception is that it should also give rise to an enhanced sensitivity to allophonic segments, such as those that take place within a consonant cluster. This latter prediction is validated by the data presented in this paper.

The current status of the magnocellular theory of developmental Dyslexia_HP.Some people doubt that the concept of developmental Dyslexia_HP (DD) is useful at all because the phonological weaknesses seen in DD cannot be distinguished from those found in every person with poor reading skills, whatever their cause. Here I argue that true DD is characterised by poor temporal processing, hence impaired visual and auditory sequencing, that is caused by impaired development of Transient_HP/magnocellular (M-) systems throughout the brain. These deficits can be measured in order to distinguish the causes of the phonological weaknesses in DD from those causing similar deficits in other types of poor reading. Importantly this knowledge can be exploited to develop effective improvements in treatment. The evidence for impaired visual magnocellular function in many, if not all, people with Dyslexia_HP is now overwhelming; it is supported not only by psychophysical tests of M- function, but also by electrophysiological, eye movement, attentional, imaging, interventional and genetic findings. Analogously, auditory temporal processing is mediated by auditory Transient_HP, 'magnocellular', processing systems, and evidence is accumulating persuasively that this system is also impaired in dyslexics. I briefly introduce the idea that 'motor magnocellular systems' may also be impaired in Dyslexia_HP, then consider genetic, immunological and nutritional factors that interact to cause the impaired magnocellular phenotype. I then discuss why the dyslexic phenotype is so common by speculating about what strengths it might confer that would maintain the responsible genes in the human genome.

Implicit sequence learning is preserved in dyslexic children.This study investigates the implicit sequence learning abilities of dyslexic children using an artificial grammar learning task with an extended exposure period. Twenty children with developmental Dyslexia_HP participated in the study and were matched with two control groups-one matched for age and other for reading skills. During 3 days, all participants performed an acquisition task, where they were exposed to colored geometrical forms sequences with an underlying grammatical structure. On the last day, after the acquisition task, participants were tested in a grammaticality classification task. Implicit sequence learning was present in dyslexic children, as well as in both control groups, and no differences between groups were observed. These results suggest that implicit learning deficits per se cannot explain the characteristic reading difficulties of the dyslexics.

Is Dyslexia_HP a Brain Disorder?Specific word reading difficulty, commonly termed &lsquo;developmental Dyslexia_HP&rsquo;, refers to the low end of the word reading skill distribution but is frequently considered to be a neurodevelopmental disorder. This term implies that brain development is thought to be disrupted, resulting in an abnormal and dysfunctional brain. We take issue with this view, pointing out that there is no evidence of any obvious Abnormality_of_the_nervous_system_HP in the vast majority of cases of word reading difficulty cases. The available relevant evidence from neuroimaging studies consists almost entirely of correlational and group-differences studies. However, differences in brains are certain to exist whenever differences in behavior exist, including differences in ability and performance. Therefore, findings of brain differences do not constitute evidence for abnormality; rather, they simply document the neural substrate of the behavioral differences. We suggest that Dyslexia_HP is best viewed as one of many expressions of ordinary ubiquitous individual differences in normal developmental outcomes. Thus, terms such as &ldquo;dysfunctional&rdquo; or &ldquo;abnormal&rdquo; are not justified when referring to the brains of persons with Dyslexia_HP.

The effects of red surrounds on visual magnocellular and parvocellular cortical processing and perception.More than 50 years ago, Hubel and Wiesel identified a subpopulation of geniculate magnocellular (M) neurons that are suppressed by Diffuse_HP red light. Since then, many human psychophysical studies have used red and green backgrounds to study the effects of M suppression on visual Task_Performance_ASDPTO, as a means to better understand neurodevelopmental disorders such as Dyslexia_HP and Schizophrenia_HP. Few of these studies have explicitly assessed the relative effects of red backgrounds on the M and P (parvocellular) pathways. Here we compared the effects of red and green Diffuse_HP background illumination on well-accepted cortical M and P signatures, both physiologically through nonlinear analysis of visual evoked potentials (VEPs; N = 15), and psychophysically through pulsed and steady pedestal perceptual thresholds (N = 9 with gray pedestals and N = 8 with colored pedestals). Red surrounds reduced P-generated temporal nonlinearity in the VEPs, but they did not influence M-generated VEP signatures. The steady and pulsed pedestal results suggest that red surrounds can have different effects on M and P contrast sensitivities, depending on whether the target is colored gray or red, presented centrally or peripherally, or whether it is brighter or dimmer than the surround. Our results highlight difficulties in interpreting the effects of red backgrounds on human VEPs or perception in terms of M specific suppression.

Attitudes and intentions of Greek teachers towards teaching pupils with Dyslexia_HP: An application of the theory of planned behaviour.The present study aims to examine Greek public primary school teachers' attitudes and intention towards teaching pupils with Dyslexia_HP using a model of the theory of planned behaviour (TPB). Toward that aim, 304 teachers aged between 22 and 59 years old, with an average overall work experience of 16.6 years completed a TPB questionnaire which assessed their attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control, their intention, as well as other exogenous factors. The validity and the reliability of the questionnaire were found to be adequate. Overall, the participating teachers report a wide range of educational interventions for pupils with Dyslexia_HP emphasizing the psychological aspects of support. They also face a number of barriers, but in general they express neutral to positive attitudes to Dyslexia_HP. Results show that attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control significantly predicted the teachers' intention towards teaching dyslexic pupils, thus confirming the applicability of the selected TPB model. Recommendations for teachers' training and limitations of the study are discussed.

Detection of neurodevelopmental diversity in memory clinics-Validation of a self-report measure.Neurodevelopmental learning and attentional disorders (NLAD) such as Dyslexia_HP, Dyscalculia_HP and Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_HP (ADHD) Affect_ASDPTO at least 6% of the adult population or more. They are associated with atypical cognitive patterns in early and adult life. The cognitive patterns of Affect_ASDPTOed individuals in late life have never been described. One main challenge is detecting individuals in clinical settings during which Mild_HP cognitive changes could be confounding the clinical presentation. This is a critical research gap because these conditions interact, across the life course, with an individual's risk for Dementia_HP. Also, learning disabilities which present in childhood pose persistent cognitive differences in areas involving Executive_Function_ASDPTO, reading and math. Clinicians lack tools to detect undiagnosed neurodevelopmental in adults with memory disorders. The majority of patients presenting at memory clinics today come from a generation during which NLAD were not yet clinically recognized. In this study, we hypothesized that a self-report scale can detect NLAD in a memory clinic population.

Reading in Children With Fragile_X_Syndrome_ASDPTO: Phonological Awareness and Feasibility of Intervention.Individuals with Fragile_X_Syndrome_ASDPTO (FXS) present with significant deficits in reading skills, but scant research exists to understand the characteristics of the reading delays or best practices for reading instruction with this population. Study 1 examined the relationship between phonological awareness and reading skills in individuals with FXS. Study 2 evaluated the feasibility of a web-based reading intervention, which incorporated phonological awareness and phonics instruction but was originally developed for mainstream students, for children with FXS. Results suggest that phonological awareness and reading skills are correlated in this population, and that instruction targeting phonological awareness and phonics should not be ruled out for individuals with FXS. Further studies are needed to examine their potential effects.
Reading in Children With Fragile X Syndrome: Phonological Awareness and Feasibility of Intervention.Individuals with fragile X syndrome (FXS) present with significant deficits in reading skills, but scant research exists to understand the characteristics of the reading delays or best practices for reading instruction with this population. Study 1 examined the relationship between phonological awareness and reading skills in individuals with FXS. Study 2 evaluated the feasibility of a web-based reading intervention, which incorporated phonological awareness and phonics instruction but was originally developed for mainstream students, for children with FXS. Results suggest that phonological awareness and reading skills are correlated in this population, and that instruction targeting phonological awareness and phonics should not be ruled out for individuals with FXS. Further studies are needed to examine their potential effects.

Optimizing text for an individual's visual system: The contribution of visual crowding to reading difficulties.Reading is a complex process that involves low-level visual processing, phonological processing, and higher-level semantic processing. Given that skilled reading requires integrating information among these different systems, it is likely that reading difficulty-known as Dyslexia_HP-can emerge from impairments at any stage of the reading circuitry. To understand contributing factors to reading difficulties within individuals, it is necessary to diagnose the function of each component of the reading circuitry. Here, we investigated whether adults with Dyslexia_HP who have impairments in visual processing respond to a visual manipulation specifically targeting their impairment. We collected psychophysical measures of visual crowding and tested how each individual's reading performance was Affected_HP by increased text-spacing, a manipulation designed to alleviate Severe_HP crowding. Critically, we identified a sub-group of individuals with Dyslexia_HP showing elevated crowding and found that these individuals read faster when text was rendered with increased letter-, word- and line-spacing. Our findings point to a subtype of Dyslexia_HP involving elevated crowding and demonstrate that individuals benefit from interventions personalized to their specific impairments.

Evidence-based pathways to intervention for children with language disorders.Paediatric speech and language therapist (SLT) roles often involve Planning_ASDPTO individualized intervention for specific children, working collaboratively with families and education staff, providing advice, training and coaching and raising awareness. A tiered approach to service delivery is currently recommended whereby services become increasingly specialized and individualized for children with greater needs.

The Impact of Morphological Awareness on Word Reading and Dictation in Chinese Early Adolescent Readers With and Without Dyslexia_HP.This study investigated the role of morphological awareness in understanding Chinese word reading and dictation among Chinese-speaking adolescent readers in Hong Kong as well as the cognitive-linguistic profile of early adolescent readers with Dyslexia_HP. Fifty-four readers with Dyslexia_HP in Grades 5 and 6 were compared with 54 chronological age-matched (CA) typical readers on the following measures of cognitive-linguistic and literacy skills: morphological awareness, phonological awareness, visual-orthographic knowledge, rapid naming, vocabulary knowledge, verbal short-term memory (STM), Chinese word reading, and dictation (or spelling). The results indicated that early adolescent readers with Dyslexia_HP performed less well than the typical readers on all cognitive-linguistic and literacy measures except the phonological measures. Both groups' scores showed substantial correlations between morphological awareness and Chinese word reading and dictation. Visual-orthographic knowledge and rapid naming were also associated with dictation in early adolescent readers with and without Dyslexia_HP, respectively. Moderated multiple regression analyses further revealed that morphological awareness and rapid naming explained unique variance in word reading and dictation for the readers with Dyslexia_HP and typical readers separately after controlling readers' age and group effect. These results highlight the potential importance of morphological awareness and rapid naming in Chinese word Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO in Chinese early adolescents' literacy development and impairment.

Can very early music interventions promote at-risk infants' development?Music and musical activities are often a natural part of parenting. As accumulating evidence shows, music can promote auditory and Language_Development_ASDPTO in infancy and early childhood. It may even help to support auditory and language skills in infants whose development is compromised by heritable conditions, like the reading deficit Dyslexia_HP, or by environmental factors, such as Premature_birth_HP. For example, infants born to dyslexic parents can have atypical brain responses to speech sounds and subsequent challenges in Language_Development_ASDPTO. Children born very preterm, in turn, have an increased likelihood of sensory, cognitive, and motor deficits. To ameliorate these deficits, we have developed early interventions focusing on music. Preliminary results of our ongoing longitudinal studies suggest that music making and parental singing promote infants' early Language_Development_ASDPTO and auditory neural processing. Together with previous findings in the field, the present studies highlight the role of active, social music making in supporting auditory and Language_Development_ASDPTO in at-risk children and infants. Once completed, the studies will illuminate both risk and protective factors in development and offer a comprehensive model of understanding the promises of music activities in promoting positive developmental outcomes during the first years of life.

Speech Recognition in Noise by Children with and without Dyslexia_HP: How is it Related to Reading?Developmental Dyslexia_HP is commonly viewed as a phonological deficit that makes it difficult to decode written language. But children with Dyslexia_HP typically exhibit other problems, as well, including Poor_speech_HP recognition in noise. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the speech-in-noise problems of children with Dyslexia_HP are related to their reading problems, and if so, if a common underlying factor might explain both. The specific hypothesis examined was that a spectral processing disorder results in these children receiving smeared signals, which could explain both the diminished sensitivity to phonological structure - leading to reading problems - and the speech recognition in noise difficulties. The alternative hypothesis tested in this study was that children with Dyslexia_HP simply have broadly based language deficits.

IFCN-endorsed practical guidelines for clinical magnetoencephalography (MEG).Magnetoencephalography (MEG) records weak magnetic fields outside the human head and thereby provides millisecond-accurate information about neuronal currents supporting human brain function. MEG and electroencephalography (EEG) are closely related complementary methods and should be interpreted together whenever possible. This manuscript covers the basic physical and physiological principles of MEG and discusses the main aspects of state-of-the-art MEG data analysis. We provide guidelines for best practices of patient preparation, stimulus presentation, MEG data collection and analysis, as well as for MEG interpretation in routine clinical examinations. In 2017, about 200 whole-scalp MEG devices were in operation worldwide, many of them located in clinical environments. Yet, the established clinical indications for MEG examinations remain few, mainly restricted to the diagnostics of Epilepsy_ASDPTO and to preoperative functional evaluation of neurosurgical patients. We are confident that the extensive ongoing basic MEG research indicates potential for the evaluation of neurological and psychiatric syndromes, developmental disorders, and the integrity of cortical brain networks after Stroke_HP. Basic and clinical research is, thus, paving way for new clinical applications to be identified by an increasing number of practitioners of MEG.

Alterations in white matter pathways underlying phonological and morphological processing in Chinese developmental Dyslexia_HP.Chinese is a logographic language that is different from alphabetic languages in visual and semantic complexity. Thus far, it is still unclear whether Chinese children with Dyslexia_HP show similar disruption of white matter pathways as in alphabetic languages. The present study focused on the alteration of white matter pathways in Chinese children with Dyslexia_HP. Using diffusion tensor imaging tractography, the Bilateral_HP arcuate fasciculus (AF-anterior, AF-posterior and AF-direct segments), inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) and inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) were delineated in each individual's native space. Compared with age-matched controls, Chinese children with Dyslexia_HP showed reduced fractional anisotropy in the Left_HP AF-direct and the Left_HP ILF. Further regression analyses revealed a functional dissociation between the Left_HP AF-direct and the Left_HP ILF. The AF-direct tract integrity was associated with phonological processing skill, an ability important for reading in all writing systems, while the ILF integrity was associated with morphological processing skill, an ability more strongly recruited for Chinese reading. In conclusion, the double disruption locus in Chinese children with Dyslexia_HP, and the functional dissociation between dorsal and ventral pathways reflect both universal and specific properties of reading in Chinese.

Orthographic learning in children with isolated and combined reading and spelling deficits.Dissociations between reading and spelling problems are likely to be associated with different underlying Cognitive_impairment_HP, and with different deficits in orthographic learning. In order to understand these differences, the current study examined orthographic learning using a printed-word learning paradigm. Children (4th grade) with isolated reading, isolated spelling and combined reading and spelling problems were compared to children with age appropriate reading and spelling skills on their performance during learning novel words and symbols (non-verbal control condition), and during immediate and delayed reading and spelling recall tasks. No group differences occurred in the non-verbal control condition. In the verbal condition, initial learning was intact in all groups, but differences occurred during recall tasks. Children with reading fluency deficits showed slower reading times, while children with spelling deficits were less accurate, both in reading and spelling recall. Children with isolated spelling problems showed no difficulties in immediate spelling recall, but had problems in remembering the spellings 2 hours later. The results suggest that different orthographic learning deficits underlie reading fluency and spelling problems: Children with isolated reading fluency deficits have no difficulties in building-up orthographic representations, but access to these representations is slowed down while children with isolated spelling deficits have problems in storing precise orthographic representations in long-term memory.

Prevalence of Developmental Dyslexia_HP in Spanish University Students.A recent concern in the field of Dyslexia_HP studies is the lack of awareness and attention to university students suffering from this condition. If this problem is serious in countries where the relative opacity of the writing system allows for an early detection and, therefore, effective interventions, it is most critical in countries where transparent spelling makes such detection difficult, except in the most Severe_HP cases. In Spain, the Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Dyslexia_HP is rare among university-level adults. The present study pursues three aims: (a) to put forward a screening instrument for the detection of university students at risk of Dyslexia_HP, (b) to determine the ratio of university students that could be at risk of Dyslexia_HP by means of two different procedures, and (c) to create awareness for a disorder that causes hitherto unrecognized difficulties for an important subgroup of the college population. Six hundred and eighty-six university students in four different fields of study within the general area of Social Sciences from a public University in Madrid completed a Spanish-adapted version of a protocol including stress assignment, spelling words and nonwords, and timed phonological Working_Memory_ASDPTO of Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO task. Results showed that between 1.6% and 6.4% of this population could be at risk of suffering Dyslexia_HP. Such risk is not evenly distributed across the four fields of study. As for gender, the first criterion used yields 1.8 males at risk for every female, but the second criterion has as many males as females at risk. Women were significantly better than men in word spelling. Spelling was best predicted by the timed phonological Working_Memory_ASDPTO task of Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO.

Quantitative assessment of drawing tests in children with Dyslexia_HP and Dysgraphia_HP.Drawing tests in children diagnosed with Dyslexia_HP and Dysgraphia_HP were quantitatively compared. Fourteen children with Dysgraphia_HP, 19 with Dyslexia_HP and 13 normally developing were asked to copy 3 figures: a circle, a square and a cross. An optoelectronic system allowed the acquisition of the drawing track in three-dimensions. The participants' head Position_HP and upper limb movements were measured as well. A set of parameters including movement duration, velocity, length of the trace, Range of Motion of the upper limb, was computed and compared among the 3 groups. Children with Dyslexia_HP traced the circle faster than the other groups. In the cross test, dyslexic participants showed a reduced execution time and increased velocity while drawing the horizontal line. Children with Dyslexia_HP were also faster in drawing certain sides of square with respect to the other groups.

The experiences of medical students with Dyslexia_HP: An interpretive phenomenological study.This article explores the experiences of U.K. medical students with Dyslexia_HP, using an interpretive phenomenological approach. This project began with a review of the literature, highlighting a void of qualitative research. We then conducted a collaborative autoethnography. This paper forms the next stage in this series of research. We aimed to elicit meaning and understanding from the lived experiences of our participants. Eight U.K. junior doctors with Dyslexia_HP were interviewed over the telephone in an in-depth, unstructured manner. Audio recordings were transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed with the aid of a template analysis. Experiences of helplessness and hopelessness were common. These may be a result of a fear of stigmatization and personal feelings of inadequacy. They may also be fuelled by the incidents of bullying and belittling from other medical students that were reported. An important meta-theme was of fear and lack of understanding. A lack of pastoral support was also reported. Their experiences of medical school assessments are also reported. More may need to be done to educate teachers and clinical supervisors on Dyslexia_HP.

Dyslexia_HP and Fonts: Is a Specific Font Useful?Nowadays, several books published in different fonts advertised as being particularly suitable for dyslexics are available on the market. Our research aimed to assess the significance of a specific reading font especially designed for Dyslexia_HP, called EasyReading™. The performances of good readers and dyslexics were compared. Fourth grade primary school students (533 students in total) were assessed based on reading tasks presented with two different layouts: the popular Times New Roman and EasyReading™, in order to investigate whether children's performances were influenced by the fonts used. The results of the study were both statistically and clinically significant, proving that EasyReading™ can be considered a compensating tool for readers with Dyslexia_HP, and a simplifying font for all categories of readers.

Second language learners who are at-risk for reading disabilities: A growth mixture model study.This one-year longitudinal study examined the developmental trajectories of English reading in Chinese children learning English as a second language (ESL) and identified cognitive profiles of children who are at risk for English Dyslexia_HP. One hundred and eighty-four Chinese ESL children from eight Hong Kong kindergartens were measured four times during their last year of kindergarten for phonological awareness, letter knowledge, vocabulary and English word reading. Growth mixture modeling was applied to classify the children based on their growth trajectories in English word reading. Four subgroups of word reading growth were classified, namely high-achieving, fast-growth, slow-growth and low-achieving groups. The cognitive-linguistic skills were compared across different groups with age, non-verbal intelligence and receptive vocabulary in L1 controlled. The results showed that low-achieving groups, who were expected to be at-risk for L2 Dyslexia_HP, showed deficits in letter-name knowledge, phonemic awareness, and receptive and expressive vocabulary. Fast-growth and high-achieving groups were not distinguishable on the measured cognitive-linguistic skills. Children in the low-growth groups were significantly weaker in phonemic awareness, receptive vocabulary and expressive vocabulary than children in the high-achieving group. Our findings identified specific cognitive-linguistic deficits that were associated with children who are at-risk for Dyslexia_HP. Implications for the early identification of L2 Dyslexia_HP were discussed.
Second language learners who are at-risk for reading disabilities: A growth mixture model study.This one-year longitudinal study examined the developmental trajectories of English reading in Chinese children learning English as a second language (ESL) and identified cognitive profiles of children who are at risk for English reading disability. One hundred and eighty-four Chinese ESL children from eight Hong Kong kindergartens were measured four times during their last year of kindergarten for phonological awareness, letter knowledge, vocabulary and English word reading. Growth mixture modeling was applied to classify the children based on their growth trajectories in English word reading. Four subgroups of word reading growth were classified, namely high-achieving, fast-growth, slow-growth and low-achieving groups. The cognitive-linguistic skills were compared across different groups with age, non-verbal intelligence and receptive vocabulary in L1 controlled. The results showed that low-achieving groups, who were expected to be at-risk for L2 reading disability, showed deficits in letter-name knowledge, phonemic awareness, and receptive and expressive vocabulary. Fast-growth and high-achieving groups were not distinguishable on the measured cognitive-linguistic skills. Children in the low-growth groups were significantly weaker in phonemic awareness, receptive vocabulary and expressive vocabulary than children in the high-achieving group.

Cognitive predictors of sequential motor impairments in children with Dyslexia_HP and/or Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_HP/Hyperactivity_HP disorder.This study examined cognitive predictors of sequential Motor_Skills_ASDPTO in 215 children with Dyslexia_HP and/or Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_HP/Hyperactivity_HP disorder (ADHD). Visual Working_Memory_ASDPTO and math fluency abilities contributed significantly to performance of sequential motor abilities in children with Dyslexia_HP (N = 67), ADHD (N = 66) and those with a comorbid Diagnosis_ASDPTO (N = 82), generally without differentiation between groups. In addition, primary diagnostic features of each disorder, such as reading and inattention, did not contribute to the variance in motor skill performance of these children. The results support a unifying framework of motor impairment in children with neurodevelopmental disorders such as Dyslexia_HP and ADHD.

Identifying Dyslexia_HP risk for sport-related concussion management: Sensitivity and specificity of self-report and rapid naming.Dyslexia_HP is the most common type of learning disability and studies have shown that student-athletes with learning disabilities sustain more concussions than their non-Affected_HP peers. However, current methods of Dyslexia_HP identification in college students are potentially invalid because they rely on students to self-report formal Dyslexia_HP diagnoses.

A Digital App to Aid Detection, Monitoring, and Management of Dyslexia_HP in Young Children (DIMMAND): Protocol for a Digital Health and Education Solution.Dyslexia_HP, a specific learning difficulty and a disability as defined in the Equality Act 2010, is a lifelong condition that affects a child from the start of education. Dyslexia_HP is characterized by difficulties in language processing (reading, spelling, and writing) which do not correspond with the child's general intellectual abilities. Although Dyslexia_HP cannot be cured, there is a consensus that interventions are more effective and have greater impact the earlier they are administered. Effective interventions start with Diagnosis_ASDPTO. Currently, formal Diagnosis_ASDPTO requires an assessment by a Dyslexia_HP specialist or educational psychologist. These assessments are expensive and are not easy for a non-specialist teacher or parent to interpret. Consequently, formal assessments are normally performed at a much later age, when interventions are less likely to be effective. Combining the latest in scientific research, expertise of Dyslexia_HP practitioners and real-time interactivity facilitated by digital technologies, we aim to provide a cost-effective and convenient solution that focuses on early Dyslexia_HP detection and management.

Simulation of Dyslexia_HP. How literacy and cognitive skills can help distinguish college students with Dyslexia_HP from malingerers.Academic accommodations associated with a Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Dyslexia_HP might be incentives for college students without reading or spelling difficulties to feign Dyslexia_HP and obtain the Diagnosis_ASDPTO unfairly. In the current study we examined malingering practices by comparing the performance of college students instructed to malinger Dyslexia_HP (n = 28) to that of students actually diagnosed with Dyslexia_HP (n = 16). We also included a control group of students without reading and spelling difficulties (n = 28). The test battery included tasks tapping literacy skills as well as underlying cognitive skills associated with literacy outcomes. These tasks are commonly used in diagnosing Dyslexia_HP. We examined patterns in the performance of malingerers across tasks and tested whether malingerers could be identified based on their performance on a limited number of tasks. Results indicated that malingerers scored significantly lower than students with Dyslexia_HP on reading and spelling skills; i.e., the core characteristics of Dyslexia_HP. Especially reading performance was extremely low and not in line with students' age and level of education. Findings for underlying cognitive skills were mixed. Overall, malingerers scored lower than students with Dyslexia_HP on tasks tapping mainly speed, whereas the two groups did not differ on tasks reflecting mainly accuracy. Based on word and pseudoword reading and letter and digit naming, the three groups could be distinguished with reasonable sensitivity and specificity. In all, results indicate that college students seem to understand on which tasks they should feign Dyslexia_HP, but tend to exaggerate difficulties on these tasks to the point where diagnosticians should mistrust performance.

Language Skills, but Not Frequency_HP Discrimination, Predict Reading Skills in Children at Risk of Dyslexia_HP.This study evaluated the claim that auditory processing deficits are a cause of reading and language difficulties. We report a longitudinal study of 245 children at family risk of Dyslexia_HP, children with preschool Language_impairment_HP, and control children. Children with Language_impairment_HP had poorer Frequency_HP-discrimination thresholds than controls at 5.5 years, but children at family risk of Dyslexia_HP did not. A model assessing longitudinal relationships among Frequency_HP discrimination, reading, language, and Executive_Function_ASDPTO skills showed that Frequency_HP discrimination was predicted by executive skills but was not a longitudinal predictor of reading or language skills. Our findings contradict the hypothesis that Frequency_HP discrimination is causally related to Dyslexia_HP or Language_impairment_HP and suggest that individuals at risk for Dyslexia_HP or who have Language_impairment_HP may perform poorly on auditory processing tasks because of comorbid attentional difficulties.

Scan patterns during scene viewing predict individual differences in clinical traits in a normative sample.The relationship between viewer individual differences and gaze control has been largely neglected in the scene perception literature. Recently we have shown a robust association between individual differences in viewer cognitive capacity and scan patterns during scene viewing. These findings suggest other viewer individual differences may also be associated with scene gaze control. Here we expand our findings to quantify the relationship between individual differences in clinical traits and scene viewing behavior in a normative sample. The present study used Successor Representation Scanpath Analysis (SRSA) to quantify the strength of the association between individual differences in scan patterns during real-world scene viewing and individual differences in viewer attention-deficit disorder, Autistic_behavior_HP, and Dyslexia_HP scores. The SRSA results revealed individual differences in vertical scan patterns that explained more than half of the variance in attention-deficit scores, a third of the variance in Autism_HP quotient scores, and about a quarter of the variance in Dyslexia_HP scores. These results suggest that individual differences in attention-deficit disorder, Autistic_behavior_HP, and Dyslexia_HP scores are most strongly associated with vertical scanning behaviors when viewing real-world scenes. More importantly, our results suggest scene scan patterns have promise as potential diagnostic tools and provide insight into the types of vertical scan patterns that are most diagnostic.

Speech-language pathology program for reading comprehension and orthography: effects on the spelling of dyslexic individuals.Purpose Prepare a Speech-language Pathology Program for Reading Comprehension and Orthography and verify its effects on the reading comprehension and spelling of students with Developmental Dyslexia_HP. Methods The study sample was composed of eleven individuals (eight males), diagnosed with Developmental Dyslexia_HP, aged 09-11 years. All participants underwent a Speech-language Pathology Program in Reading Comprehension and Orthography comprising 16 individual weekly sessions. In each session, tasks of reading comprehension of texts and orthography were developed. At the beginning and end of the Program, the participants were submitted to a specific assessment (pre- and post-test). Results The individuals presented difficulty in reading comprehension, but the Cloze technique proved to be a useful remediation tool, and significant improvement in their performance was observed in the post-test evaluation. The dyslexic individuals showed poor performance for their educational level in the spelling assessment. At the end of the program, their performance evolved, but it remained below the expected, showing the same error pattern at the pre- and post-tests, with errors in both natural and arbitrary spelling. Conclusion The proposed Speech-language Pathology Program for Reading Comprehension and Orthography produced positive effects on the reading comprehension, spelling, and motivation to Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO of the participants. This study presents an unprecedented contribution by proposing joint stimulation of Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO by means of a program easy to apply and analyze in individuals with Developmental Dyslexia_HP.

Decreased functional connectivity in the fronto-parietal network in children with Mood_ASDPTO_Disorders_ASDPTO compared to children with Dyslexia_HP during rest: An fMRI study.The DSM-5 separates the diagnostic criteria for Mood_ASDPTO and Behavioral_abnormality_HP. Both types of disorders share neurocognitive deficits of Executive_Function_ASDPTO and reading difficulties in childhood. Children with Dyslexia_HP also have Executive_Function_ASDPTO deficits, revealing a role of Executive_Function_ASDPTO circuitry in reading. The aim of the current study is to determine whether there is a significant relationship of functional connectivity within the fronto-parietal and cingulo-opercular cognitive control networks to reading measures for children with Mood_ASDPTO_Disorders_ASDPTO, Behavioral_abnormality_HP, Dyslexia_HP, and Healthy_HP controls (HC).

Reply to: "The Relationship between Eye Movements and Reading Difficulties", Blythe, Kirkby & Liversedge.This is my response to the critique by Blythe et al. of my review 'What is Developmental Dyslexia_HP?'. In this response, I provide greater detail about the evidence supporting the view that faulty eye movement control can cause dyslexics' visual reading difficulties and that impaired development of the visual magnocellular system may be the underlying cause.

Reading Profiles in Multi-Site Data With Missingness.Children with Dyslexia_HP exhibit varied deficits in reading and cognitive abilities that contribute to their reading comprehension problems. Some children exhibit primary deficits in phonological processing, while others can exhibit deficits in oral language and executive functions that Affect_ASDPTO comprehension. This behavioral Heterogeneous_HP is problematic when missing data prevent the characterization of different reading profiles, which often occurs in retrospective data Sharing_ASDPTO initiatives without coordinated data collection. Here we show that reading profiles can be reliably identified based on Random Forest classification of incomplete behavioral datasets, after the missForest method is used to multiply impute missing values. Results from simulation analyses showed that reading profiles could be accurately classified across degrees of missingness (e.g., ∼5% classification error for 30% missingness across the sample). The application of missForest to a real multi-site dataset with missingness (

Reading Derived Words by Italian Children With and Without Dyslexia_HP: The Effect of Root Length.Children with Dyslexia_HP are extremely slow at reading long words but they are faster with stimuli composed of roots and derivational suffixes (e.g., CASSIERE, 'cashier') than stimuli not decomposable in morphemes (e.g., CAMMELLO, 'camel'). The present study assessed whether root length modulates children's morphological processing. For typically developing readers, root activation was expected to be higher for longer than shorter roots because longer roots are more informative access units than shorter ones. By contrast, readers with Dyslexia_HP were not expected to be facilitated by longer roots because these roots might exceed dyslexics' processing capacities. Two groups of Italian 6th graders, with and without Dyslexia_HP, read aloud low-Frequency_HP derived words, with familiar roots and suffixes. Word reaction times (RTs) and mispronunciations were recorded. Linear mixed-effects regression analyses on RTs showed the inhibitory effect of word length and the facilitating effect of root Frequency_HP for both children with and without Dyslexia_HP. Root length predicted RTs of typically developing readers only, with faster RTs for longer roots, over and above the inhibitory effect of word length. Furthermore, typically developing children had faster RTs on words with more Frequent_HP suffixes while children with Dyslexia_HP were faster when roots had a small family size. Generalized_HP linear regression analyses on accuracy showed facilitating effects of word Frequency_HP and suffix Frequency_HP, for both groups. The large word length effect on latencies confirmed laborious whole-word processing in children when reading low-Frequency_HP derived words. The absence of a word Frequency_HP effect along with the facilitating effect of root Frequency_HP indicated morphemic processing in all readers. The reversed root length effect in typically developing readers pointed to a stronger activation for longer roots in keeping with the idea that these represent particularly informative units for word decoding. For readers with Dyslexia_HP the facilitating effect of root Frequency_HP (not modulated by root length) confirmed a pervasive benefit of root activation while the lack of root length modulation indicated that the longest roots were for them too large units to be processed within a single fixation.

A Selective Deficit in Phonetic Recalibration by Text in Developmental Dyslexia_HP.Upon hearing an ambiguous speech sound, listeners may adjust their perceptual interpretation of the speech input in accordance with contextual information, like accompanying text or lipread speech (i.e., phonetic recalibration; Bertelson et al., 2003). As developmental Dyslexia_HP (DD) has been associated with reduced integration of text and speech sounds, we investigated whether this deficit becomes manifest when text is used to induce this type of audiovisual learning. Adults with DD and normal readers were exposed to ambiguous consonants halfway between /aba/ and /ada/ together with text or lipread speech. After this audiovisual exposure phase, they categorized auditory-only ambiguous test sounds. Results showed that individuals with DD, unlike normal readers, did not use text to recalibrate their phoneme categories, whereas their recalibration by lipread speech was spared. Individuals with DD demonstrated similar deficits when ambiguous vowels (halfway between /wIt/ and /wet/) were recalibrated by text. These findings indicate that DD is related to a specific letter-speech sound association deficit that extends over phoneme classes (vowels and consonants), but - as lipreading was spared - does not extend to a more general audio-visual integration deficit. In particular, these results highlight diminished reading-related audiovisual learning in addition to the commonly reported phonological problems in developmental Dyslexia_HP.

As developmental dyslexia (DD) has been associated with reduced integration of text and speech sounds, we investigated whether this deficit becomes manifest when text is used to induce this type of audiovisual learning. Adults with DD and normal readers were exposed to ambiguous consonants halfway between /aba/ and /ada/ together with text or lipread speech. After this audiovisual exposure phase, they categorized auditory-only ambiguous test sounds. Results showed that individuals with DD, unlike normal readers, did not use text to recalibrate their phoneme categories, whereas their recalibration by lipread speech was spared. Individuals with DD demonstrated similar deficits when ambiguous vowels (halfway between /wIt/ and /wet/) were recalibrated by text. These findings indicate that DD is related to a specific letter-speech sound association deficit that extends over phoneme classes (vowels and consonants), but - as lipreading was spared - does not extend to a more general audio-visual integration deficit. In particular, these results highlight diminished reading-related audiovisual learning in addition to the commonly reported phonological problems in developmental dyslexia.
Altered activation and functional asymmetry of exner's area but not the visual word form area in a child with sudden-Onset_HP, persistent mirror writing.Mirror writing is often produced by Healthy_HP children during early acquisition of literacy, and has been observed in adults following neurological disorders or insults. The neural mechanisms responsible for involuntary mirror writing remain debated, but in Healthy_HP children, it is typically attributed to the Global_developmental_delay_HP of a process of overcoming mirror invariance while learning to read and write. We present an unusual case of sudden-Onset_HP, persistent mirror writing in a previously typical seven-year-old girl. Using her dominant Right_HP hand only, she copied and spontaneously produced all letters, words and sentences, as well as some numbers and objects, in mirror image. Additionally, she frequently misidentified letter orientations in perceptual assessments. Clinical, neuropsychological, and functional neuroimaging studies were carried out over sixteen months. Neurologic and ophthalmologic examinations and a standard clinical MRI scan of the head were normal. Neuropsychological testing revealed average scores on most tests of intellectual function, language function, verbal learning and memory. Visual_Perception_ASDPTO and visual Reasoning_ASDPTO were average, with the exception of below average form constancy, and Mild_HP difficulties on some visual memory tests. Activation and functional connectivity of the Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO network was assessed with fMRI. During a reading task, the VWFA showed a strong response to words in mirror but not in normal letter orientation - similar to what has been observed in typically developing children previously - but activation was atypically reduced in Right_HP primary visual cortex and Exner's Area. Resting-state connectivity within the Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO network was similar to that of age-matched controls, but hemispheric asymmetry between the balance of motor-to-visual input was found for Exner's Area. In summary, this unusual case suggests that a disruption to visual-motor integration rather than to the VWFA can contribute to sudden-Onset_HP, persistent mirror writing in the absence of clinically detectable neurological insult.

Visual information processing and cerebral activation in dyslexic boys: Quantitative EEG analysis during discrimination reading tasks.The hypothesis that in developmental Dyslexia_HP the integration of visually presented information and language processing is dysfunctional is tested. Results of processing visually presented letter strings during EEG recordings are presented. The task difficulty of the letter strings was standardised individually and automatically by a computer program. EEG was recorded during rest conditions and different levels of reading performance. 30 developmental dyslexic boys who met the Denckla criteria of "Dyslexia_HP pure" and 28 matched control subjects were investigated. The main replicated results were: (1) There was a delay in dyslexic children in processing visually presented letter information, (2) there was no deficit in sustained attention in developmental dyslexics, (3) increasing cognitive activation and reading performance resulted in a faster attenuation of relative alpha power in dyslexics compared to controls, and (4) the dyslexic group did not reveal characteristic Focal_HP EEG features when task difficulty was standardised individually.

Dyscalculia_HP and Dyslexia_HP: Different behavioral, yet similar brain activity profiles during arithmetic.Brain disorders are often investigated in isolation, but very different conclusions might be reached when studies directly contrast multiple disorders. Here, we illustrate this in the context of specific Learning_Disorders_ASDPTO, such as Dyscalculia_HP and Dyslexia_HP. While children with Dyscalculia_HP show deficits in arithmetic, children with Dyslexia_HP present with reading difficulties. Furthermore, the comorbidity between Dyslexia_HP and Dyscalculia_HP is surprisingly high. Different hypotheses have been proposed on the origin of these disorders (number processing deficits in Dyscalculia_HP, phonological deficits in Dyslexia_HP) but these have never been directly contrasted in one brain imaging study. Therefore, we compared the brain activity of children with Dyslexia_HP, children with Dyscalculia_HP, children with comorbid Dyslexia_HP/Dyscalculia_HP and Healthy_HP controls during arithmetic in a design that allowed us to disentangle various processes that might be associated with the specific or common neural origins of these Learning_Disorders_ASDPTO. Participants were 62 children aged 9 to 12, 39 of whom had been clinically diagnosed with a specific learning disorder (Dyscalculia_HP and/or Dyslexia_HP). All children underwent fMRI scanning while performing an arithmetic task in different formats (dot arrays, digits and number words). At the behavioral level, children with Dyscalculia_HP showed lower accuracy when subtracting dot arrays, and all children with Learning_Disorders_ASDPTO were slower in responding compared to typically developing children (especially in symbolic formats). However, at the neural level, analyses pointed towards substantial neural similarity between children with Learning_Disorders_ASDPTO: Control children demonstrated higher activation levels in frontal and parietal areas than the three groups of children with Learning_Disorders_ASDPTO, regardless of the disorder. A direct comparison between the groups of children with Learning_Disorders_ASDPTO revealed similar levels of neural activation throughout the brain across these groups. Multivariate subject generalization analyses were used to statistically test the degree of similarity, and confirmed that the neural activation patterns of children with Dyslexia_HP, Dyscalculia_HP and Dyslexia_HP/Dyscalculia_HP were highly similar in how they deviated from neural activation patterns in control children. Collectively, these results suggest that, despite differences at the behavioral level, the brain activity profiles of children with different Learning_Disorders_ASDPTO during arithmetic may be more similar than initially thought.

Inhibition and Updating, but Not Switching, Predict Developmental Dyslexia_HP and Individual Variation in Reading Ability.To elucidate the core Executive_Function_ASDPTO profile (strengths and weaknesses in inhibition, updating, and switching) associated with Dyslexia_HP, this study explored Executive_Function_ASDPTO in 27 children with Dyslexia_HP and 29 age matched controls using sensitive z-mean measures of each ability and controlled for individual differences in processing speed. This study found that developmental Dyslexia_HP is associated with inhibition and updating, but not switching impairments, at the error z-mean composite level, whilst controlling for processing speed. Inhibition and updating (but not switching) error composites predicted both Dyslexia_HP likelihood and reading ability across the full range of variation from typical to atypical. The predictive relationships were such that those with poorer performance on inhibition and updating measures were significantly more likely to have a Diagnosis_ASDPTO of developmental Dyslexia_HP and also demonstrate poorer reading ability. These findings suggest that inhibition and updating abilities are associated with developmental Dyslexia_HP and predict reading ability. Future studies should explore Executive_Function_ASDPTO training as an intervention for children with Dyslexia_HP as core Executive_Function_ASDPTOs appear to be modifiable with training and may transfer to improved reading ability.

Do all visual deficits cause pure Alexia_HP? Dissociations between visual processing and reading suggest "no".Pure Alexia_HP is a deficit of reading affecting the ability to process a word's letters in parallel. Instead, a slow, effortful letter-by-letter reading strategy is employed. It has been claimed that a Visual_impairment_HP caused the reading impairment. The present study compares visual processing and word reading of a patient with Severe_HP visuospatial deficits due to probable posterior Cerebral_cortical_atrophy_HP (PCA) to two patients with pure Alexia_HP. A double dissociation emerged between visual processing and word reading: The participant with PCA was Severe_HPly impaired in all visual tasks but read fluently while the patients with pure Alexia_HP read slowly but exhibited better preserved visual processing. It is concluded that a Visual_impairment_HP does not inevitably lead to pure Alexia_HP, and that this syndrome is more plausibly conceived of as an orthographic deficit. In addition, the PCA patient's hypometabolism was assessed, and the interaction of the dorsal and ventral visual stream in word reading is discussed.

Review of EEG-based pattern classification frameworks for Dyslexia_HP.Dyslexia_HP is a disability that causes difficulties in Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO despite average intelligence. This hidden disability often goes undetected since dyslexics are normal and Healthy_HP in every other way. Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the upcoming methods being researched for identifying unique brain activation patterns in dyslexics. The aims of this paper are to examine pros and cons of existing EEG-based pattern classification frameworks for Dyslexia_HP and recommend optimisations through the findings to assist future research. A critical analysis of the literature is conducted focusing on each framework's (1) data collection, (2) pre-processing, (3) analysis and (4) classification methods. A wide range of inputs as well as classification approaches has been experimented for the improvement in EEG-based pattern classification frameworks. It was uncovered that incorporating reading- and writing-related tasks to experiments used in data collection may help improve these frameworks instead of using only simple tasks, and those unwanted artefacts caused by body movements in the EEG signals during Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO activities could be minimised using artefact subspace reconstruction. Further, support vector machine is identified as a promising classifier to be used in EEG-based pattern classification frameworks for Dyslexia_HP.

Spatial selective attention and asynchrony of cognitive systems in adult dyslexic readers: an ERPs and behavioral study.The aim of this study was to gain additional knowledge about the asynchrony phenomenon in developmental Dyslexia_HP, especially when spatial selective attention is manipulated. Adults with developmental Dyslexia_HP and non-impaired readers underwent two experimental tasks, one including alphabetic stimuli (pre-lexical consonant-vowel syllables) and the other containing non-alphabetic stimuli (pictures and sounds of animals). Participants were instructed to attend to the Right_HP or Left_HP hemifields and to respond to all stimuli on that hemifield. Behavioral parameters and event-related potentials were recorded. The main finding was that the dyslexic readers demonstrated asynchrony between the auditory and visual modalities when alphabetic stimuli were presented on the Right_HP hemifield. These results suggest that intact reading is linked to a synchronized auditory and visual speed of processing even when spatial selective attention is manipulated. The findings of the current study are discussed in terms of asynchrony between modalities as a neurocognitive marker in developmental Dyslexia_HP.

Representational Bias in the Radial Axis in Children With Dyslexia_HP: A Landmarks Alignment Study.To better identify the distinctive characteristics of space representation in the radial dimension, we have proposed a new paradigm: the landmarks alignment task where two parallel aluminum bars were radially presented. Children had to move a landmark along one bar and place it at the same location as the reference landmark placed by the examiner on the parallel bar. The major interest of this task was its capacity to assess space representation in the radial dimension when considering a spatial landmark that oriented the subject's attention toward the orthogonal dimension. The most important result showed that in the radial dimension children with Dyslexia_HP exhibited a forward bias on the Left_HP bar, meaning a mental underrepresentation of the Left_HPward peripersonal space and/or a mental overrepresentation of the rightward peripersonal space. Furthermore, reading discrepancies were correlated with radial forward bias on the Left_HP bar. The experiment was also conducted in the Lateral_HP axis, showing a pseudoneglect behavior in children without Dyslexia_HP. Our landmarks alignment task had the advantage of being able to assess space representation in a complex environment. The forward radial representational bias in children with Dyslexia_HP could have implications for spatial orientation in peripersonal workspace in school situations.

Meta-analytic findings reveal lower means but higher variances in visuospatial ability in Dyslexia_HP.Conflicting empirical and theoretical accounts suggest that Dyslexia_HP is associated with either average, enhanced, or impoverished high-level visuospatial processing relative to controls. Such Heterogeneous_HP results could be due to the presence of wider variability in dyslexic samples, which is unlikely to be identified at the single study level, due to lack of power. To address this, this study reports a meta-analysis of means and variances in high-level visuospatial ability in 909 non-dyslexic and 956 dyslexic individuals. The findings suggest that Dyslexia_HP is associated not only with a lower mean performance on visuospatial tasks but also with greater variability in performance. Through novel meta-analytic techniques, we demonstrate a negative effect size for mean differences (-.457), but a positive effect size for SD differences (+.118; SD ratio = 1.107). In doing so, this is the first study to demonstrate impoverished visuospatial processing of the majority of individuals with Dyslexia_HP in addition to greater variance in performance in this group. The findings advocate for further consideration of both the presence of, and reasons for, increased variance in perception, attention, and memory across neurodevelopmental disorders.

The Influence of Dyslexia_HP Candidate Genes on Reading Skill in Old Age.A number of candidate genes for reading and Language_impairment_HP have been replicated, primarily in samples of children with developmental disability or delay, although these genes are also supported in adolescent population samples. The present study used a systematic approach to test 14 of these candidate genes for association with reading assessed in late adulthood (two cohorts with mean ages of 70 and 79 years). Gene-sets (14 candidates, axon-guidance and neuron migration pathways) and individual SNPs within each gene of interest were tested for association using imputed data referenced to the 1000 genomes European panel. Using the results from the genome-wide association (GWA) meta-analysis of the two cohorts (N = 1217), a competitive gene-set analysis showed that the candidate gene-set was associated with the reading index (p = .016) at a family wise error rate corrected significance level. Neither axon guidance nor neuron migration pathways were significant. Whereas individual SNP associations within CYP19A1, DYX1C1, CNTNAP2 and DIP2A genes (p < .05) did not reach corrected significance their allelic effects were in the same direction as past available reports. These results suggest that reading skill in normal adults shares the same genetic substrate as reading in adolescents, and clinically disordered reading, and highlights the utility of adult samples to increase sample sizes in the genetic study of developmental disorders.

The present study used a systematic approach to test 14 of these candidate genes for association with reading assessed in late adulthood (two cohorts with mean ages of 70 and 79 years). Gene-sets (14 candidates, axon-guidance and neuron migration pathways) and individual SNPs within each gene of interest were tested for association using imputed data referenced to the 1000 genomes European panel. Using the results from the genome-wide association (GWA) meta-analysis of the two cohorts (N = 1217), a competitive gene-set analysis showed that the candidate gene-set was associated with the reading index (p = .016) at a family wise error rate corrected significance level. Neither axon guidance nor neuron migration pathways were significant. Whereas individual SNP associations within CYP19A1, DYX1C1, CNTNAP2 and DIP2A genes (p < .05) did not reach corrected significance their allelic effects were in the same direction as past available reports. These results suggest that reading skill in normal adults shares the same genetic substrate as reading in adolescents, and clinically disordered reading, and highlights the utility of adult samples to increase sample sizes in the genetic study of developmental disorders.

Dyslexia_HP and Dyscalculia_HP are characterized by common Visual_Perception_ASDPTO deficits.A number of studies have investigated the Cognitive_impairment_HP underlying Dyslexia_HP and Dyscalculia_HP. Yet, it remains unclear as to whether Dyslexia_HP and Dyscalculia_HP are associated with the common Visual_Perception_ASDPTO deficits. The current investigation analyzed cognitive performance in children with Dyslexia_HP, Dyscalculia_HP, comorbidity, and typically developing subjects. The results showed that children with Dyslexia_HP, Dyscalculia_HP and comorbidity exhibited common deficits in numerosity processing and Visual_Perception_ASDPTO. Furthermore, Visual_Perception_ASDPTO deficits accounted for deficits in numerosity processing in all three groups. The results suggest that Visual_Perception_ASDPTO deficits are a common cognitive deficit underlying both developmental Dyslexia_HP and Dyscalculia_HP.

A Cross-Modal Working_Memory_ASDPTO Binding Span Deficit in Dyslexia_HP.Successful reading demands the ability to combine visual-phonological information into a single representation and is associated with an efficient short-term memory. Dyslexia_HP may consequently involve an impaired Working_Memory_ASDPTO binding of visual and phonological information. The present study proposes two span tasks for assessing visual-phonological Working_Memory_ASDPTO binding. The tasks involved memorizing cross-modal associations between nonsense figures and nonwords, and they were administered, with other Working_Memory_ASDPTO measures, to children with and without a Dyslexia_HP. The tasks required recognizing which figure was associated with a given nonword and recalling which nonword was associated with a given figure. Children with a Dyslexia_HP had a similar significant deficit in both cross-modal binding tasks when compared with the control children, and the difference remained significant even after controlling for other verbal and Absent_speech_HP Working_Memory_ASDPTO measures. The cross-modal binding tasks described here seem to capture a core aspect of Working_Memory_ASDPTO associated with reading and may be a useful procedure for assessing reading disabilities.

Auditory temporal processing, reading, and phonological awareness among aging adults.Auditory temporal processing (ATP) has been related in the literature to both speech perception as well as reading and phonological awareness. In aging adults, it is known to be related to difficulties in speech perception. In the present study, we aimed to test whether an age-related deficit in ATP would also be accompanied by poor reading and phonological awareness. Thirty-eight aging adults were compared to 55 readers with Dyslexia_HP and 42 young normal readers on temporal order judgment (TOJ), speech perception, reading, and phonological awareness tests. Aging adults had longer TOJ thresholds than young normal readers, but shorter than readers with Dyslexia_HP; however, they had lower speech perception accuracy than both groups. Phonological awareness of the aging adults was better than readers with Dyslexia_HP, but poorer than young normal readers, although their reading accuracy was similar to that of the young controls. This is the first report on poor phonological awareness among aging adults. Suprisingly, it was not accompanied by difficulties in reading ability, and might instead be related to aging adults' difficulties in speech perception. This newly discovered relationship between ATP and phonological awareness among aging adults appears to extend the existing understanding of this relationship, and suggests it should be explored in other groups with ATP deficits.

Pragmatic competence and its relationship with the linguistic and cognitive profile of young adults with Dyslexia_HP.The study assessed the pragmatic skills of 19 well-compensated Italian-speaking young adults with Dyslexia_HP compared with controls. A comprehensive pragmatic assessment tool was employed, targeting production and comprehension (Assessment of Pragmatic Abilities and Cognitive Substrates [APACS]). Participants were also administered a series of standardized tests to assess verbal and non-verbal cognitive abilities, including executive functions and social cognition tests. Data were analysed with the aim of understanding whether pragmatic abilities are compromised in Dyslexia_HP and of exploring associations between pragmatic performance and other cognitive domains. The performance of the Dyslexia_HP group was poorer than that of the control group in both expressive and receptive modalities. Data showed Diffuse_HP problems across several domains, with the greatest challenge posed by inferring nonliteral meanings, which indicates that pragmatic inefficiency is an important aspect of the linguistic and communicative profile of Dyslexia_HP in adulthood. Explorative correlations highlighted a relation between pragmatic performance and reading and vocabulary abilities, as well as between pragmatics and Working_Memory_ASDPTO. This suggests that pragmatic difficulties are strongly tied to the most distinctive aspects of Dyslexia_HP, namely, phonological awareness, verbal short-term memory, pseudo-word repetition, whereas the link with high-level executive functions and Theory of Mind is negligible.

Predictors for grade 6 reading in children at familial risk of Dyslexia_HP.The present study investigates whether grade 6 reading outcomes, reading fluency, and reading comprehension can be predicted by grade 3 reading fluency, familial risk of Dyslexia_HP (FR), and grade 3 reading related skills: rapid automatized naming (RAN), phonological awareness (PA), and vocabulary. In a sample of 150 children, of whom 83 had a parent with Dyslexia_HP, correlation and regression analyses were performed. FR, measured on a continuous scale, was by itself related to all outcomes. However, FR did not explain any variance on top of grade 3 reading fluency. Grade 3 reading fluency strongly predicted grade 6 reading fluency and was also related to reading comprehension. RAN improved the prediction of grade 6 reading fluency, though the additional explained variance was small. Vocabulary and PA fully explained the variance that grade 3 reading fluency explained in grade 6 reading comprehension. Vocabulary explained a substantial amount of variance in grade 6 reading comprehension making it an interesting clinical target. As we used continuous measures of reading fluency and FR, our findings are not biased by distinct diagnostic criteria.

What is Dyslexia_HP? An exploration of the relationship between teachers' understandings of Dyslexia_HP and their training experiences.Given that an estimated 5-10% of the worldwide population is said to have Dyslexia_HP, it is of great importance that teachers have an accurate understanding of what Dyslexia_HP is and how it effects their students. Using results from a large-scale survey of teachers in England and in Wales (N ≈ 2,600), this paper demonstrates that teachers held a basic understanding of Dyslexia_HP, based on the behavioural issues that it is associated with. Teachers lacked the knowledge of the biological (i.e., neurological) and cognitive (i.e., processing) aspects of Dyslexia_HP. Moreover, a number of teachers mentioned visual factors in their description of Dyslexia_HP, despite there being inconclusive evidence to suggest a direct relationship between visual functioning and Dyslexia_HP. Further findings demonstrate the importance of good-quality teacher training in increasing teachers' confidence working with those with Dyslexia_HP, while increasing their knowledge of the cognitive aspects of Dyslexia_HP. This paper argues that evidence-based teacher training, which informs teachers of the up-to-date research on the biological, cognitive, and behavioural aspects of Dyslexia_HP, is essential to combat misconceptions and ensure that teachers have more nuanced and informed understandings of Dyslexia_HP.

A Translational Framework of Educational Neuroscience in Learning_Disorders_ASDPTO.Neuroimaging has undergone enormous progress during the last two and a half decades. The combination of neuroscientific methods and educational practice has become a focus of interdisciplinary research in order to answer more applied questions. In this realm, conditions that hamper learning success and have deleterious effects in the population - such as Learning_Disorders_ASDPTO (LD) - could especially profit from neuroimaging findings. At the moment, however, there is an ongoing debate about how far neuroscientific research can go to inform the practical work in educational settings. Here, we put forward a theoretical translational framework as a method of conducting neuroimaging and bridging it to education, with a main focus on Dyscalculia_HP and Dyslexia_HP. Our work seeks to represent a theoretical but mainly empirical guide on the benefits of neuroimaging, which can help people working with different aspects of LD, who need to act collaboratively to reach the full potential of neuroimaging. We provide possible ideas regarding how neuroimaging can inform LD at different levels within our multidirectional framework, i.e., mechanisms, Diagnosis_ASDPTO/prognosis, training/intervention, and community/education. In addition, we discuss methodological, conceptual, and structural limitations that need to be addressed by future research.

Tablet computer games to measure dorsal stream performance in good and poor readers.Evidence suggests a link between deficits in visuo-spatial attention, and subsequent reading ability. However, all the research in the area thus far has been conducted using traditional, lab-based psychophysics, with very tightly controlled visual parameters. In order to take this research further, such as using visuo-spatial tasks for remediation purposes, it must be established that such tasks can be taken out of the laboratory, 'gamified', and still predict reading ability. This study aimed to determine if subtle visual deficits in poor readers could be detected outside a traditional laboratory, in relatively uncontrolled settings using portable game-like technology. Classic visual search and change detection programs, thought to rely on the visual dorsal stream, were modified to a game-like format. They were administered on a portable computer tablet within the participants' school setting. Whilst IQ predicted reading rate, visuo-spatial tasks such as visual search speed, and change detection, each accounted for unique variance in reading rate over and above IQ, age and phonological ability. These results are consistent with the visuo-spatial Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_HP hypothesis, and provide support for the development of portable computerised games that may assess and potentially target this deficit in poor readers.

Structural and functional abnormality of the putamen in children with developmental Dyslexia_HP.There is currently debate with regards to the role of phonological deficit in Chinese reading difficulty, even though some researchers have suggested that the deficit of phonological processing is also a signature of developmental Dyslexia_HP in Chinese, as has been found in alphabetic languages. In this study, we examined the brain mechanisms of phonological deficit in Chinese children with developmental Dyslexia_HP (DD) during an auditory rhyming judgment task. First, we examined structural differences in Chinese Dyslexia_HP by comparing gray and white matter volume in Chinese children with DD, age-matched controls (AC), and reading-matched controls (RC). Next, we examined whether the regions with an abnormal volume in DD showed deficient functional connectivity with the rest of the brain during a phonological task (i.e. auditory rhyming judgment). We found that both AC and RC had greater gray matter volume (GMV) at the Left_HP putamen and Right_HP dorsal Lateral_HP frontal cortex than DD, suggesting possible neural signatures of developmental Dyslexia_HP. Functional connectivity analysis revealed that the Left_HP putamen was more connected with the Right_HP inferior occipital gyrus (IOG) in AC and RC than in DD, suggesting that automatic orthographic involvement during spoken language processing is more salient in controls, while the Left_HP putamen was more connected with the Left_HP transverse temporal gyrus (TTG) and Left_HP insula in DD than in AC and RC, suggesting the phonological articulation -auditory feedback loop is more involved in DD. These findings suggest that the reduced Left_HP putamen might contribute to phonological deficits experienced in DD, since it showed deficient connectivity with the rest of the brain during phonological processing.

[The place of the native language in speech therapy].A high number of children consulting a speech therapist for a Language_impairment_HP have in common the direct or indirect experience of migration and therefore find themselves in a context of plurilingualism. A dedicated group, called Mélimémo, has been set up for children in such situations. It enables their linguistic and cultural diversity to be integrated into the speech therapy.

Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP and Attentional Bias in Children with Specific Learning_Disorders_ASDPTO.Children with specific Learning_Disorders_ASDPTO (SLDs) face a unique set of socio-emotional challenges as a result of their academic difficulties. Although a higher prevalence of Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP in children with SLD is often reported, there is currently no research on cognitive mechanisms underlying this Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP. One way to elucidate these mechanisms is to investigate attentional bias to threatening stimuli using a dot-probe paradigm. Our study compared children ages 9-16 with SLD (n = 48) to typically-developing (TD) controls (n = 33) on their attentional biases to stimuli related to general threats, reading, and stereotypes of SLD. We found a significant threat bias away from reading-related stimuli in the SLD, but not TD group. This attentional bias was not observed with the general threat and stereotype stimuli. Further, children with SLD reported greater Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP compared to TD children. These results suggest that children with SLD experience greater Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP, which may partially stem from reading specifically. The finding of avoidance rather than vigilance to reading stimuli indicates the use of more top-down attentional control. This work has important implications for therapeutic approaches to Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP in children with SLD and highlights the need for attention to socio-emotional difficulties in this population. Future research is needed to further investigate the cognitive aspects of socio-emotional difficulties in children with SLD, as well as how this may impact academic outcomes.

Relationship between phonological Working_Memory_ASDPTO, metacognitive skills and reading comprehension in children with learning disabilities.Reading requires the activation of several cognitive processes, some of which are basic, e.g. recognizing letters and words, whereas others are complex, such as Working_Memory_ASDPTO and ability to think about one's own learning strategies. One condition for fulfilling a complex cognitive task, such as understanding a text, is the ability to maintain and process information, which depends on Working_Memory_ASDPTO.

Interactions between eye movements and posture in children with neurodevelopmental disorders.In everyday life, our activities frequently involve the simultaneous performance of two or more tasks. Sharing_ASDPTO attention between two concurrent tasks may result in a decrease in performance specifically among children with neurodevelopmental disorders. The objective of the study was to determine whether the influence of postural conditions (sitting condition, single task; standing condition, dual task) on eye movement performances on three visual tasks with high attentional load (visually-guided saccade task, memory-guided saccade task and fixation task) was different in children with neurodevelopmental disorders (Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_HP and hyperactive disorder, Dyslexia_HP, and high functioning Autistic_behavior_HP) when compared to typically developing children. One hundred and four children (26 per group, sex-age- and IQ-matched groups) were evaluated. We found that for the fixation task only, the three groups of children with neurodevelopmental disorders had poorer eye movements performances in the standing condition compared to the sitting condition while no such difference was found for typically developing children. We suggest that children with neurodevelopmental disorders have fewer attentional resources available for performing correctly oculomotor tasks with high attentional load leading to impairment of these tasks for maintaining a good level of postural stability.

One hundred and four children (26 per group, sex-age- and IQ-matched groups) were evaluated. We found that for the fixation task only, the three groups of children with neurodevelopmental disorders had poorer eye movements performances in the standing condition compared to the sitting condition while no such difference was found for typically developing children. We suggest that children with neurodevelopmental disorders have fewer attentional resources available for performing correctly oculomotor tasks with high attentional load leading to impairment of these tasks for maintaining a good level of postural stability.
Exploring relationships between Joint_hypermobility_HP and neurodevelopment in children (4-13 years) with hereditary connective tissue disorders and developmental coordination disorder.Joint_hypermobility_HP (JH) is a common, though largely ignored physical trait with increasing clinical reverberations. A few papers suggest a link between JH and selected neurodevelopmental disorders, such as developmental coordination disorder (DCD). JH is also the hallmark of various hereditary connective tissue disorders (HCTDs). Children with HCTDs may present abnormal neurodevelopment but its manifestations remain undetermined. This study examined 23 children (group 1), aged 4-13 years, with different HCTDs (i.e., 19 with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS)/hypermobility spectrum disorder, 3 with molecularly confirmed classical EDS, and 1 with Loeys-Dietz syndrome type 1 due to TGFBR2 mutation) and 23, age- and sex-matched children with DCD (group 2). All underwent 14 different psychometric tests exploring motor, cognitive, executive-attentive, and emotional-behavior features. In group 1, 30%, 22%, and 13% patients presented DCD (with or without Dysgraphia_HP), learning disabilities, and Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_HP, respectively. None had Global_developmental_delay_HP. In group 2, 17% patients presented Generalized_HP JH and none had HCTDs. DCD children presented more motor and coordination troubles than HCTDs patients, while quality of life of children with HCTDs resulted more deteriorated due to somatic manifestations and behavioral traits. This study presents the full overview of neurodevelopmental attributes in HCTDs, and compares with standardized tools the neurodevelopmental profile of children with DCD and HCTDs. While the high rate of neurodevelopmental Comorbidities_ASDPTO in HCTDs deserves attention, the impact of a dysfunctional connective tissue in children with a Primary_Diagnosis_ASDPTO of DCD needs more research.

Mapping the intersection of language and reading: the neural bases of the primary systems hypothesis.The primary systems framework has been used to relate behavioural performance across many different language activities to the status of core underpinning domain-general cognitive systems. This study provided the first quantitative investigation of this account at both behavioural and neural levels in a group of patients with Chronic_HP post-Stroke_HP Aphasia_HP. Principal components analysis was used to distil orthogonal measures of phonological and semantic processing, which were then related to reading performance and the underlying lesion distributions using voxel-based correlational methodology. Concrete word reading involved both a ventral semantic pathway, and inferior and anterior aspects of the dorsal phonological pathway. Abstract word reading overlapped with the ventral semantic pathway but also drew more extensively on the superior and posterior aspects of the dorsal phonological pathway. Nonword reading was related to phonological processing along the dorsal pathway and was also supported by a more superior set of regions previously associated with speech motor output. The use of continuous measures of behavioural performance and neural integrity allowed us to elucidate for the first time both the lesion and behavioural correlates for the semantic and phonological components of the primary systems hypothesis and to extend these by identifying the importance of an additional dorsal speech motor output system. These results provide a target for future neuroanatomically constrained computational models of reading.

Behavioral and electrophysiological investigation of speech perception deficits in silence, noise and envelope conditions in developmental Dyslexia_HP.The present study investigated whether children with developmental Dyslexia_HP showed specific deficits in the perception of three phonetic features (voicing, place, and manner of articulation) in optimal (silence) and degraded listening conditions (envelope-coded speech versus noise), using both standard behavioral and electrophysiological measures. Performance of children with Dyslexia_HP was compared to that of younger typically developing children who were matched in terms of reading age. Results showed no significant group differences in response accuracy except for the reception of place-of-articulation in noise. However, dyslexic children responded more slowly than typically developing children across all conditions with larger deficits in noise than in envelope than in silence. At the neural level, dyslexic children exhibited reduced N1 components in silence and the reduction of N1 amplitude was more pronounced for voicing than for the other phonetic features. In the envelope condition, the N1 was Localized_HP over the Right_HP hemisphere and it was larger for typically developing readers than for dyslexic children. Finally, in Nonprogressive_HP noise, the N1 to place of articulation was clearly delayed in children with Dyslexia_HP, which suggests a temporal de-organization in the most adverse listening conditions. The results clearly show abnormal neural processing to speech sounds in all conditions. They are discussed in the context of recent theories on perceptual noise exclusion, neural noise and temporal sampling.

Influence of increased letter spacing and font type on the reading ability of dyslexic children.Recent research studies have shown that increased letter spacing has a positive effect on the reading ability of dyslexic individuals. This study aims to investigate the effect of spacing on the readability of different fonts for children with and without Dyslexia_HP. Results did not support the hypothesis of better performance among children with Dyslexia_HP when reading text in Dyslexie than in other fonts. They, however, revealed that only spacing plays a role in enhancing dyslexic individuals' reading performance because Dyslexie and the Times New Roman interspaced font have no difference. Furthermore, the negative effect of the unfriendly fonts Times New Roman Italic and Curlz MT was eliminated through increased interletter spacing.

Adult perceptions of children with Dyslexia_HP in the USA.This study examined adult perceptions of Dyslexia_HP among US adults. Participants (n = 623) answered survey questions pertaining to characteristics, views, and possible causes of DYS. Exploratory factor analysis revealed five distinct factors: (1) psychosocial causes, (2) external causes, (3) biological causes, (4) consequences, and (5) controllability. Three-way ANOVA's were conducted to determine the effects of ethnicity, gender, and parental status on how DYS was perceived. The results revealed ethnic, gender, and parental status differences. Males endorsed psychosocial causes and external causes more often than females. Those who self-identified as Asian viewed DYS as more controllable in comparison to Whites. Results also revealed a three-way interaction regarding controllability. Understanding the public's perceptions about developmental disorders helps distinguish true from erroneous beliefs, and understanding differences that may exist in particular groups can help implement targeted actions to improve awareness, care, and interventions for families.

Neural correlates of phonological processing: Disrupted in children with Dyslexia_HP and enhanced in musically trained children.Phonological processing has been postulated as a core area of deficit among children with Dyslexia_HP. Reduced brain activation during phonological processing in children with Dyslexia_HP has been observed in Left_HP-hemispheric temporoparietal regions. Musical training has shown positive associations with phonological processing abilities, but the neural mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unspecified. The present research aims to distinguish neural correlates of phonological processing in school-age typically developing musically trained children, musically untrained children, and musically untrained children with Dyslexia_HP utilizing fMRI. A whole-brain ANCOVA, accounting for gender and Absent_speech_HP cognitive abilities, identified a main effect of group in Bilateral_HP temporoparietal regions. Subsequent region-of-interest analyses replicated temporoparietal hypoactivation in children with Dyslexia_HP relative to typically developing children. By contrast, musically trained children showed greater Bilateral_HP activation in temporoparietal regions when compared to each musically untrained group. Therefore, musical training shows associations with enhanced Bilateral_HP activation of Left_HP-hemispheric regions known to be important for reading. Findings suggest that engagement of these regions through musical training may underlie the putative positive effects of music on reading development. This supports the hypothesis that musical training may facilitate the development of a Bilateral_HP compensatory neural network, which aids children with atypical function in Left_HP-hemispheric temporoparietal regions.

tDCS Modulatory Effect on Reading Processes: A Review of Studies on Typical Readers and Individuals With Dyslexia_HP.The possibility to use non-invasive brain stimulation to modulate reading performance in individuals with developmental Dyslexia_HP (DD) has been recently explored by few empirical investigations. The present systematic review includes nine studies which have employed transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) aiming at improving reading abilities in both typical readers and individuals with DD. Anodal tDCS over the Left_HP temporo-parietal cortex-a region which is typically involved in phonological and orthographic processing during reading tasks and underactive in individuals with DD-was the most frequently used montage. The majority of studies employing such stimulation protocol showed significant improvement in differential reading subprocesses. More precisely, word decoding was improved in adult readers, whereas non-word and low-Frequency_HP word reading in younger individuals. Furthermore, tDCS was found to be specifically effective in poor readers and individuals with DD rather than typical readers, in spite of the specific brain region targeted by the stimulation; Left_HP frontal, Left_HP temporo-parietal, and Right_HP cerebellar tDCS failed to modulate reading in already proficient readers. Overall, tDCS appears to be a promising remedial tool for reading difficulties, even when applied to younger populations with reading problems. Further empirical evidence is needed to confirm the potential of neuromodulation as a successful intervention method for DD.

No evidence for Abnormal_cerebellum_morphology_HP in adults with developmental Dyslexia_HP.Developmental Dyslexia_HP is commonly believed to result from a deficiency in the recognition and processing of speech sounds. According to the cerebellar deficit hypothesis, this phonological deficit is caused by deficient cerebellar function. In the current study, 26 adults with developmental Dyslexia_HP and 25 non-dyslexic participants underwent testing of reading-related skills, cerebellar functions, and MRI scanning of the brain. Anatomical assessment of the cerebellum was conducted with voxel-based morphometry. Behavioural evidence, that was indicative of impaired cerebellar function, was found to co-occur with reading impairments in the dyslexic subjects, but a causal relation between the two was not observed. No differences in local grey matter volume, nor in structure-function relationships within the cerebellum were found between the two groups. Possibly, the observed behavioural pattern is due to aberrant white matter connectivity. In conclusion, no support for the cerebellar deficit hypothesis or the presence of anatomical differences of the cerebellum in adults with developmental Dyslexia_HP was found.

Cognitive-linguistic profiles of Chinese typical-functioning adolescent dyslexics and high-functioning dyslexics.Dyslexia_HP is a developmental disability affecting the acquisition of Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO skills, and its developmental nature makes longitudinal research of great importance. This study therefore investigated the cognitive-linguistic profiles of the typical-functioning dyslexics and high-functioning dyslexics with longitudinal cohorts of Chinese-speaking adolescents diagnosed with childhood Dyslexia_HP. These two dyslexic groups of fifty students (with 25 typical-functioning dyslexics) were assessed in Grade 2 (Time 1) and in Grade 8 (Time 2), whereas 25 typically developing controls were assessed at Time 2. Students were administered measures of phonological awareness, morphological skills, visual-orthographic knowledge, rapid naming, verbal Working_Memory_ASDPTO, and literacy skills. Results showed that, at Time 2, both dyslexic groups performed less well than the control group on most of the measures. Deficits in rapid naming were particularly salient in both dyslexic groups. Comparing the two dyslexic groups, the typical-functioning dyslexics had more multiple deficits than the high-functioning dyslexics. Findings highlight the importance of rapid naming deficits as potential universal causes of Dyslexia_HP and the utility of targeting visual-orthographic knowledge and morphological skills in supporting the development of dyslexic adolescents.

A replicable, low-burden mechanism for observing, recording, and analysing mother-child interaction in population research.There is growing evidence that specific styles of parent-child interaction benefit child development, particularly child Language_Development_ASDPTO. Direct observational techniques help clarify the behaviours and styles within parent-child interactions that may influence child language outcomes; however, these techniques tend to be labour-intensive and costly. We report on the development of a replicable, low-burden mechanism for observing and coding specific maternal linguistic behaviours in a population-based cohort of 2-year-olds.

Neural correlates of phonological, orthographic and semantic reading processing in Dyslexia_HP.Developmental Dyslexia_HP is one of the most prevalent learning disabilities, thought to be associated with dysfunction in the neural systems underlying typical reading acquisition. Neuroimaging research has shown that readers with Dyslexia_HP exhibit regional hypoactivation in Left_HP hemisphere reading nodes, relative to control counterparts. This evidence, however, comes from studies that have focused only on isolated aspects of reading. The present study aims to characterize Left_HP hemisphere regional hypoactivation in readers with Dyslexia_HP for the main processes involved in successful reading: phonological, orthographic and semantic. Forty-one participants performed a demanding reading task during MRI scanning. Results showed that readers with Dyslexia_HP exhibited hypoactivation associated with phonological processing in parietal regions; with orthographic processing in parietal regions, Broca's area, ventral occipitotemporal cortex and thalamus; and with semantic processing in angular gyrus and hippocampus. Stronger functional connectivity was observed for readers with Dyslexia_HP than for control readers 1) between the thalamus and the inferior parietal cortex/ventral occipitotemporal cortex during pseudoword reading; and, 2) between the hippocampus and the

[Current possibilities of visual rehabilitation].Diseases of the eyes and visual pathways can lead to different Visual_field_defect_HP, which limit the patients' abilities in everyday life in different ways. Central_HP Visual_field_defect_HP cause mainly reading disorders and Peripheral_HP defects cause disorders of orientation and mobility. Rehabilitation measures have to be adapted specifically to the deficit and the individual needs of the patient. In Central_HP Scotoma_HP, reading ability can mostly be restored by magnifying visual aids. In reading disorders caused by insufficient size of the reading visual field, text magnification is contraindicated. In this case, contrast-enhancing or non-visual aids are applied. Modern electronic media are successfully used particularly by young people with visual impairments. Computer-based training programs are of increasing importance, especially saccadic training for orientation disorders due to concentric and homonymous visual field impairments.

Understanding comorbidity of Learning_Disorders_ASDPTO: task-dependent estimates of prevalence.Reading disorder (RD) and mathematics disorder (MD) frequently co-occur. However, the exact comorbidity rates differ largely between studies. Given that MD is characterised by high Heterogeneous_HP on the symptom level, differences in comorbidity rates may result from different mathematical subskills used to define MD. Comorbidity rates with RD are likely to be higher when MD is measured by mathematical subskills that do not only build on number processing, but also require language (i.e. arithmetic fluency), than when measured by magnitude processing skills.

Grapheme-Phoneme Learning in an Unknown Orthography: A Study in Typical Reading and Dyslexic Children.In this study, we examined the learning of new grapheme-phoneme correspondences in individuals with and without Dyslexia_HP. Additionally, we investigated the relation between grapheme-phoneme learning and measures of phonological awareness, orthographic knowledge and rapid automatized naming, with a focus on the unique joint variance of grapheme-phoneme learning to word and non-word reading achievement. Training of grapheme-phoneme associations consisted of a 20-min training program in which eight novel letters (Hebrew) needed to be paired with speech sounds taken from the participant's native language (Dutch). Eighty-four third grade students, of whom 20 were diagnosed with Dyslexia_HP, participated in the training and testing. Our results indicate a reduced ability of dyslexic readers in applying newly learned grapheme-phoneme correspondences while reading words which consist of these novel letters. However, we did not observe a significant independent contribution of grapheme-phoneme learning to reading outcomes. Alternatively, results from the regression analysis indicate that failure to read may be due to differences in phonological and/or orthographic knowledge but not to differences in the grapheme-phoneme-conversion process itself.

A pilot Indian family-based association study between Dyslexia_HP and Reelin pathway genes, DCDC2 and ROBO1, identifies modest association with a triallelic unit TAT in the gene RELN.Dyslexia_HP is a neurodevelopmental disorder that manifests as a Dyslexia_HP despite normal intelligence and adequate educational opportunity. Twin and family studies have indicated a genetic component, while genome-wide studies have implicated a number of susceptibility genes, most of which have direct or indirect roles in neuronal migration. Reelin (RELN) has important biological functions facilitating migration of neurons. Polymorphisms in RELN have been implicated in related disorders like Autism_HP and Schizophrenia_HP but have not been examined in Dyslexia_HP. We hypothesized that not only RELN, but its interactors in the neuronal migration pathway may play roles in the etiology of Dyslexia_HP. Twenty two functional variants across six RELN signalling genes (RELN, VLDLR, APOER2, DAB1, LIS1 and NDEL1) and two Dyslexia_HP candidate genes (DCDC2 and ROBO1) were analyzed for association in twenty six nuclear and three extended families with individuals Affected_HP with Dyslexia_HP.

Gender-Dependent Changes in Time Production Following Quadrato Motor Training in Dyslexic and Normal Readers.Time estimation is an important component of the ability to organize and plan sequences of actions as well as cognitive functions, both of which are known to be altered in Dyslexia_HP. While Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_HP are accompanied by short Time Productions (TPs), expert meditators have been reported to produce longer durations, and this seems to be related to their increased attentional resources. In the current study, we examined the effects of a month of Quadrato Motor Training (QMT), which is a structured sensorimotor training program that involves sequencing of motor responses based on verbal commands, on TP using a pre-post design. QMT has previously been found to enhance attention and EEG oscillatory activity, especially within the alpha range. For the current study, 29 adult Hebrew readers were recruited, of whom 10 dyslexic participants performed the QMT. The normal readers were randomly assigned to QMT (

EEG Resting State Functional Connectivity in Adult Dyslexics Using Phase Lag Index and Graph Analysis.Developmental Dyslexia_HP may involve deficits in functional connectivity across widespread brain networks that enable fluent reading. We investigated the large-scale organization of electroencephalography (EEG) functional networks at rest in 28 dyslexics and 36 typically reading adults. For each Frequency_HP band (delta, theta alpha and beta), we assessed functional connectivity strength with the phase lag index (PLI). Network topology was examined using minimum spanning tree (MST) graphs derived from the functional connectivity matrices. We found significant group differences in the alpha band (8-13 Hz). The graph analysis indicated more interconnected nodes, in dyslexics compared to typical readers. The graph metrics were significantly correlated with age in dyslexics but not in typical readers, which may indicate more Heterogeneous_HP in maturation of brain networks in dyslexics. The present findings support the involvement of alpha oscillations in higher cognition and the sensitivity of graph metrics to characterize functional networks in adult Dyslexia_HP. Finally, the current results extend our previous findings on children.

The neuronal migration hypothesis of Dyslexia_HP: A critical evaluation 30 years on.The capacity for language is one of the key features underlying the complexity of human cognition and its evolution. However, little is known about the neurobiological mechanisms that mediate normal or impaired linguistic ability. For developmental Dyslexia_HP, early postmortem studies conducted in the 1980s linked the disorder to subtle defects in the migration of neurons in the developing neocortex. These early studies were reinforced by human genetic analyses that identified Dyslexia_HP susceptibility genes and subsequent evidence of their involvement in neuronal migration. In this review, we examine recent experimental evidence that does not support the link between Dyslexia_HP and neuronal migration. We critically evaluate gene function studies conducted in rodent models and draw attention to the lack of robust evidence from histopathological and imaging studies in humans. Our review suggests that the neuronal migration hypothesis of Dyslexia_HP should be reconsidered, and the neurobiological basis of Dyslexia_HP should be approached with a fresh start.

Genetic association analysis with pedigrees: Direct inference using the composite likelihood ratio.The likelihood function represents statistical evidence given data and a model. The evidential paradigm (EP), an alternative to Bayesian and Frequentist paradigms, provides considerable theory demonstrating evidence strength for different parameter values via the ratio of likelihoods at different parameter values; thus, enabling inference directly from the likelihood function. The likelihood function, however, can be difficult to compute; for example, in genetic association studies with a binary outcome in large pedigrees. Composite likelihood (CL) is an alternative when the real likelihood is intractable. We show CLs have the two large sample properties of the EP for reliable evidence interpretation: (1) CL supports the true value over a false value by an arbitrarily large factor; and (2) the probability of favouring a false value over the true value is small and bounded. Using simulation, and in a genetic association analysis of Dyslexia_HP (RD) in large rolandic Epilepsy_ASDPTO pedigrees, we show that the CL approach yields valid statistical inference and identifies RD associated variants. When compared to analyses using Generalized_HP estimating equations, results show a similar prioritization of SNPs, although the CL approach provides additional complementary information, and more intuitive solutions to the multiple hypothesis testing problem.

Influence of imputation strategies on the identification of brain functional connectivity networks.Whenever neurophysiological data, such as EEG data are recorded, occurring artifacts pose an essential problem. This study addresses this issue by using imputation methods whereby whole data sets of a trial, or distinct electrodes, are not removed from the analysis of the EEG data but are replaced. We present different imputation strategies but use only two which are optimal for this particular study; predictive mean matching and data augmentation. The study addresses the as of yet unresolved question if the quality of derived brain functional networks is Ameliorated_by_HP imputation methods compared to traditional exclusion techniques which drop data, and will finally assesses the differences between the two imputation methods themselves used here. In this study, EEG data from a study evaluating Dyslexia_HP-specific therapy on a neurophysiological level were used to investigate imputation strategies in research of cortical interaction. Several recorded values were artificially declared as 'missing'. This enables the comparison of networks based on the complete data set without any missing values (pseudo ground truth) and those derived from imputation approaches in a realistic situation of disturbed data. Functional connectivity was quantified by time-variant partial directed coherence, providing a directed, temporally varying and Frequency_HP-selective connectivity measure. Based on the comparison between pseudo ground truth and networks of data with Excluded_HP missing values and data with imputed values, we found that any imputation strategy is preferable to the entire exclusion of data. The study also showed that the choice of the applied imputation algorithm impacts the resulting networks only marginally.

White matter network connectivity deficits in developmental Dyslexia_HP.A number of studies have shown an abnormal connectivity of certain white matter pathways in developmental Dyslexia_HP, as well as correlations between these white matter pathways and behavioral deficits. However, whether developmental Dyslexia_HP presents broader white matter network connectivity disruption is currently unknown. The present study reconstructed white matter networks for 26 dyslexic children (11.61 ± 1.31 years) and 31 age-matched controls (11.49 ± 1.36 years) using constrained spherical deconvolution tractography. Network-based statistics (NBS) analysis was performed to identify network connectivity deficits in dyslexic individuals. Network topological features were measured based on graph theory to examine whether these parameters correlate with literacy skills, and whether they explain additional variance over previously established white matter connectivity abnormalities in dyslexic children. The NBS analysis identified a network connecting the Left_HP-occipital-temporal cortex and temporo-parietal cortex that had decreased streamlines in dyslexic children. Four network topological parameters (clustering coefficient, local efficiency, transitivity, and global efficiency) were positively correlated with literacy skills of dyslexic children, and explained a substantial proportion of additional variance in literacy skills beyond connectivity measures of white matter pathways. This study for the first time reports a disconnection in a local subnetwork in the Left_HP hemisphere in Dyslexia_HP and shows that the global white matter network topological properties contribute to reduced literacy skills in dyslexic children.

Dyslexia_HP due to an ocular motor disorder: A case of an adolescent girl with a previous Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Dyslexia_HP.Dyslexia_HP is a Dyslexia_HP characterized by difficulties with accurate and/or fluent word recognition, which are thought to stem from a phonological processing impairment. Herein we report the case of a 13-year-old girl who received the Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Dyslexia_HP at age 12 years. We considered this Diagnosis_ASDPTO to be incorrect because her reading difficulty was caused by a spontaneously repeated eye movement toward the vertical direction; the eyes were likely to show slow, upward drifts followed by quick downward movement at the physical examination, and the amplitude of the downward movement was increased when she changed eye positions to look at the upper direction in the evaluation of the eye tracker. Although we considered there was the possibility that the spontaneously repeated eye movement was classified as the spontaneous Downbeat_Nystagmus_HP, the eye tracker showed the transition of the gaze starting from and returning to was inconsistent with Nystagmus_HP, and we concluded that the term of Nystagmus_HP like Abnormality_of_eye_movement_HP was appropriate for the expression of the spontaneously repeated eye movement. There was no apparent abnormality on head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and whole exome sequencing showed no known candidate genes to explain the cerebellar dysfunction. An accumulation of similar cases in the future should help elucidate the pathomechanism observed in this case, and we should fully pay attention to evaluate the neurological aspects of the patients before settling on the Diagnosis_ASDPTO of Dyslexia_HP.

Abnormality_of_the_cerebral_white_matter_HP and tract lateralization in children with Dyslexia_HP and isolated spelling deficits.The present study investigated whether children with a typical Dyslexia_HP profile and children with isolated spelling deficits show a distinct pattern of white matter alteration compared with typically developing peers. Relevant studies on the topic are scarce, rely on small samples, and often suffer from the limitations of conventional tensor-based methods. The present Constrained Spherical Deconvolution study includes 27 children with typical reading and spelling skills, 21 children with Dyslexia_HP and 21 children with isolated spelling deficits. Group differences along major white matter tracts were quantified utilizing the Automated Fiber Quantification software and a lateralization index was calculated in order to investigate the structural asymmetry of the tracts. The two deficit groups mostly displayed different patterns of Abnormality_of_the_cerebral_white_matter_HP, located in the Bilateral_HP inferior longitudinal fasciculi, Right_HP superior longitudinal fasciculus, and cingulum for the group with Dyslexia_HP and in the Left_HP arcuate fasciculus for the group with isolated spelling deficits. The two deficit groups differed also with respect to structural asymmetry. Children with Dyslexia_HP did not show the typical Left_HPward asymmetry of the arcuate fasciculus, whereas the group with isolated spelling deficits showed absent Right_HPward asymmetry of the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. This study adds evidence to the notion that different profiles of combined or isolated reading and spelling deficits are associated with different neural signatures.

Increased reliance on a Right_HP hemispheric mechanism during idiom processing in adults with Dyslexia_HP.Previous studies on adults with Dyslexia_HP (DYS) have indicated difficulties in the comprehension of figurative language. Using the divided visual field paradigm, the present study investigated the hemispheric processing of idioms among 22 adults with DYS and 21 regular reader (RR) adults. Participants performed a lexical decision task for a target word related to either a literal or a figurative interpretation of an idiom. The results show that whereas the RR group demonstrated a Bilateral_HP pattern of hemispheric processing of idiomatic meanings, the DYS group showed a Right_HP hemisphere (RH) advantage. Furthermore, both groups demonstrated the typical RH advantage in processing the literal meanings of idioms. Our findings indicate increased recruitment of the RH in Dyslexia_HP, probably due to differences in cerebral language areas or weaker LH semantic processing.

English as a foreign language teacher training needs and perceived preparedness to include dyslexic learners: The case of Greece, Cyprus, and Poland.This study examines the effect of demographic variables on the beliefs of teachers of English as a foreign language (EFL) about their preparedness to include dyslexic learners in mainstream classrooms in Greece, Cyprus, and Poland and identifies their professional development needs. Statistically significant multivariate analysis effects were obtained for country, training, teaching experience with dyslexic learners, and school type. Unlike overall teaching experience and completed level of education (degree), the type of teaching experience with dyslexic EFL learners (direct contact and personal involvement in teaching) seems to shape the perception of teacher preparedness to successfully include these learners. Other interesting tendencies were identified such as between-country differences concerning sources of prior professional knowledge on EFL and Dyslexia_HP as well as preferences for particular modes of training. The paper highlights the demand for professional training on EFL and Dyslexia_HP as this was confirmed across the three countries.

Enhanced semantic involvement during word recognition in children with Dyslexia_HP.We investigated whether children with Dyslexia_HP show enhanced semantic involvement as compensation for deficient phonological processing during reading. Phonological and semantic processing during reading and moderating effects of word Frequency_HP and word length in children with and without Dyslexia_HP were examined using a picture-word priming paradigm. Participants were 61 children with Dyslexia_HP and 50 typical readers in Grade 6 of primary school. Primes were either semantically or phonologically (shared Onset_HP and rime) related or unrelated to their target word. Results showed that priming effects were stronger in children with Dyslexia_HP than in typical readers in the semantic condition but did not differ between groups in the phonological condition. Overall, word length and word Frequency_HP effects were stronger for children with Dyslexia_HP than for typical readers, but word length and word Frequency_HP did not Affect_ASDPTO priming effects differently for the two groups. In both groups, only semantic priming effects were stronger for low-Frequency_HP longer words. Finally, individual word and pseudoword reading efficiency correlated with priming effects only in the semantic condition and only in children with Dyslexia_HP. It can be concluded that children with Dyslexia_HP, compared with typical readers, rely more on semantic information in word reading but do not show deficient phonological activation during reading compared with typical readers.

Decreased functional connectivity of the salience network during narrative comprehension in children with reading difficulties: An fMRI study.Dyslexia_HP is a neurobiological learning disability, reflected through deficits in written (i.e. reading) but not in spoken language. Since written and spoken language rely on cognitive control abilities, we aimed to compare functional connectivity of the understudied salience network which is related to cognitive control in children with Dyslexia_HP vs. typical readers during a functional MRI narrative comprehension task. Although children with Dyslexia_HP showed similar comprehension levels as typical readers, neuroimaging data revealed children with Dyslexia_HP showed significantly decreased functional connectivity values of an independent component (IC) related to the salience network. The functional connectivity values in the salience network IC were negatively correlated with behavioral data of Working_Memory_ASDPTO in those with Dyslexia_HP. These findings further express that Dyslexia_HP is manifested through atypical involvement of neural circuits related to EF, specifically the salience network even when attending narratives. Since the salience network is related to switching abilities and error detection, future research should focus on strengthening these abilities early in life for better future reading outcomes.

Letter and Speech Sound Association in Emerging Readers With Familial Risk of Dyslexia_HP.In alphabetic scripts, learning letter-sound (LS) association (i.e., letter knowledge) is a strong predictor of later reading skills. LS integration is related to Left_HP superior temporal cortex (STC) activity and its disruption was previously observed in Dyslexia_HP (DYS). Whether disruption in LS association is a cause of reading impairment or a consequence of decreased exposure to print remains unclear. Using fMRI, we compared activation for letters, speech sounds and LS association in emerging readers with (FHD+,

Impact of Factors that Affect_ASDPTO Reading Skill Level on King-Devick Baseline Performance Time.The King-Devick (K-D) test is often used as part of a multimodal assessment to screen for sport-related concussion. However, the test involves reading numbers, and little is known about variation in baseline performance on the K-D by reading skill level. We conducted a cross-sectional study analyzing data from the Concussion Assessment, Research and Education (CARE) Consortium to assess differences in baseline performance on the K-D associated with factors that impact reading skill level (learning disorder [LD] and primary home language other than English [PHLOTE]), while controlling for covariates (gender, type of sport, attentional issues, history of concussion and modality of administration). We had a sample of 2311 student-athletes (47% female), and multivariate regression indicated an average K-D performance time of 40.4 s. Presence of LD was associated with a 3.3 s slower K-D time (95% CI 1.9-4.7, p < 0.001), and PHLOTE was associated with a 2.6 s slower K-D time (95% CI 1.2-4.0, p < 0.001), after controlling for other covariates. These results suggest caution in the use of normative data with the K-D. Future studies should explore the impact of factors associated with reading skill level on sensitivity of the K-D in detecting concussion.

Validity and Reliability of the Dyslexia_HP Checklist for Chinese Children.The study on developmental Dyslexia_HP (DD) has fairly matured in the past decades, even when there is a lack of a standardized and convenient instrument for Dyslexia_HP in the Chinese population. The purpose of this study was to assess the reliability and validity of the Dyslexia_HP Checklist for Chinese Children (DCCC), which was administered to Chinese students in primary school. A total of 545 students from grades 2 through 6 were recruited in Wuhan to participate in this study. We used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to evaluate the structure validity of the DCCC. Concurrent validity was determined via correlations between the DCCC and the verbal comprehension index (VCI), and Chinese achievement. The reliability of the DCCC was assessed via test-retest reliability and internal consistency. The CFA suggested that the first order model with eight factors and 55 items fit the data well (RMSEA = 0.057, CFI = 0.930, and TLI = 0.925). The DCCC was negatively associated with VCI (

When Trustworthy Information Becomes Inaccessible: The Search Behaviour of Users with Dyslexia_HP in an Online Encyclopedia.The ability to search for trustworthy information has become increasingly important. Access to information is key for a democratic, inclusive society. However, poorly designed search user interfaces exclude certain user groups. For instance, search systems with high demands for correctly spelled queries have been reported to be challenging for people with reading and spelling difficulties, such as Dyslexia_HP. In a qualitative pre-study, four adults with Dyslexia_HP were interviewed about their search experiences in an encyclopedia with low tolerance for spelling errors. The participants regarded the encyclopedia as highly credible and preferred using this source for factual queries. Nevertheless, the users with Dyslexia_HP were highly dependent on Google due to high spelling demands in the encyclopedia search interface. Although the participants found relevant information on Google, they reported the search process as tiresome, since the result list assessment required a significant amount of reading. In contrast, searching the encyclopedia provided direct access to neutral, evaluated information, thus removing the evaluation phase. Moreover, searching was frequently associated with feelings such as Fatigue_HP, frustrations and failure. Results from this study imply that search user interface design affects the information searching behavior of people with Dyslexia_HP.

Toward the Language Oscillogenome.Language has been argued to arise, both ontogenetically and phylogenetically, from specific patterns of brain wiring. We argue that it can further be shown that core features of language processing emerge from particular phasal and cross-Frequency_HP coupling properties of neural oscillations; what has been referred to as the language 'oscillome.' It is expected that basic aspects of the language oscillome result from genetic guidance, what we will here call the language 'oscillogenome,' for which we will put forward a list of candidate genes. We have considered genes for altered brain rhythmicity in conditions involving language deficits: Autistic_behavior_HP, Schizophrenia_HP, specific Language_impairment_HP and Dyslexia_HP. These selected genes map on to aspects of brain function, particularly on to neurotransmitter function. We stress that caution should be adopted in the construction of any oscillogenome, given the range of potential roles particular Localized_HP Frequency_HP bands have in cognition. Our aim is to propose a set of genome-to-language linking hypotheses that, given testing, would grant explanatory power to brain rhythms with respect to language processing and evolution.

Are predictors of reading impairment in isolated cleft similar to those in idiopathic Dyslexia_HP?Children with isolated Cleft_lip_HP and/or palate (iCL/P) are at increased risk for reading impairment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of early risk factors (hearing, speech, and early literacy) on reading performance compared to Unaffected_HP participants with average (uAR) and impaired (uIR) reading. Reading achievement and early literacy skills were evaluated across three groups (27 iCL/P, 32 uAR, and 33 uIR). All participants were males, ages 8-11 years old. Those with history of head trauma/injury or major medical/mental health conditions were Excluded_HP. Group differences in achievement and early literacy skills were evaluated with ANCOVAs. Participants with impaired reading achievement (at or below 25th Percentile) were identified. Medical record reviews for participates with iCL/P were conducted and audiology and speech ratings recorded. Correlations were calculated between achievement, early literacy, hearing, and speech. Participants with iCL/P had significantly elevated risk for reading impairment (37%); this risk differed by cleft type (0% iCL, 55% iCLP, and 60% iCP). Achievement for participants with iCP was similar to the uIR group. Early literacy risk resulted in lower achievement scores for both iCL/P and Unaffected_HP participants. History of inadequate hearing and speech did not significantly impact early literacy or achievement measures. There is a high risk of reading impairment for children with iCL/P-highest for those with iCLP and iCP. Early literacy predictors of reading outcome are similar for iCL/P and idiopathic Dyslexia_HP. Current screening and intervention methods are supported.

Statistical methods and reporting practices in the study of Dyslexia_HP.This report presents findings from a review of the journals Dyslexia_HP and Annals of Dyslexia_HP over a 10-year period from 2005 to 2014. Three hundred articles were reviewed to examine statistical methodology and reporting practices. Articles were coded according to their reported covariates, effect sizes, and statistical methods. In addition, trends were examined in relation to the 2008 release of the What Works Clearinghouse Procedures and Standards Handbook from the Institute of Education Sciences in order to evaluate any potential impact of recommended practices. We found an increase in prevalence of specific statistical methods as well as increases in reporting of effect sizes following publication of the handbook. The reporting of effect sizes statistically significantly increased following publication of the manual (55% prepublication vs. 72% post-publication). The use of analysis of variance increased post-publication, whereas articles using no statistical methods or descriptives only decreased. Approximately one third of articles included covariates in their analysis; inclusion of covariates was consistent from prepublication to post-publication. Findings indicate that over the past 10 years, articles are becoming increasingly rigorous in methodology and reporting practices.

N1 lateralization and Dyslexia_HP: An event-related potential study in children with a familial risk of Dyslexia_HP.The rapid automatic specialized processing of printed words is signalled by the Left_HP-lateralization of the N1 component in the visual event-related potential (ERP). In the present study, we have investigated whether differences in N1 lateralization can be observed between Dutch children with and without (a familial risk of) Dyslexia_HP around the age of 12 years using a linguistic judgement task. Forty-five participants were included in the ERP analysis, 18 in the low familial risk group without Dyslexia_HP, 15 in the high familial risk group without Dyslexia_HP, and 12 in the high familial risk group with Dyslexia_HP. The results showed that although the N1 peaked slightly earlier in the Left_HP hemisphere, the N1 amplitude was Right_HP-lateralized in all groups. Moreover, there were no group differences in N1 amplitude or latency, and there was no relationship between reading (related) test scores and N1 characteristics. The results of the present study and our previous findings in adults suggest that print-tuning lateralization is a process that is still developing in adolescence. Because other studies did find N1 lateralization in younger readers with a print versus nonprint contrast, the current results seem to indicate that differences in N1 lateralization also depend on the experimental paradigm.

Reading in a transparent second language with limited orality: The case of high school students with Dyslexia_HP in Latin.Research has shown that individuals with Dyslexia_HP have difficulty in reading not only in their native language but also in a second language (L2). The considered L2, however, has always been a language acquired through exposure to both written and oral forms. The present study examines the case of Italian adolescents reading in Latin as an L2, which is the special case of a dead language with very limited use of orality. As the learning of Latin is mainly based on the acquisition of grammar, this study also examined the relationship between grammatical proficiency and reading ability in Latin. Results suggested that, compared with control peers, students with Dyslexia_HP had difficulty in reading words and non-words in Latin. Interestingly, in spite of Latin being learnt mainly through written language, the extent of their difficulty was no larger than they encountered when reading in their native language. Also, despite the fact that students with Dyslexia_HP showed relatively less Severe_HP difficulties with Latin grammar (as compared to reading), this did not support them when reading Latin words, unlike typical readers. The theoretical and educational implications of these results are discussed.

Rapid improvement of reading performance in children with Dyslexia_HP by altering the reading strategy: A novel approach to diagnoses and therapy of reading deficiencies.Dyslexia_HP is termed "Dyslexia_HP" if it is much lower than other cognitive abilities according to the intelligence quotient (IQ). This means that Dyslexia_HP is caused by an impairment of abilities other than those which the IQ requires. Therefore, reading performance should improve immediately if these impairments are either eliminated or compensated.

Diminished brain responses to second-language words are linked with native-language literacy skills in Dyslexia_HP.Dyslexia_HP is characterized by poor reading skills, yet often also difficulties in second-language learning. The differences between native- and second-language speech processing and the establishment of new brain representations for spoken second language in Dyslexia_HP are not, however, well understood. We used recordings of the mismatch negativity component of event-related potential to determine possible differences between the activation of long-term memory representations for spoken native- and second-language word forms in Finnish-speaking 9-11-year-old children with or without Dyslexia_HP, studying English as their second language in school. In addition, we sought to investigate whether the bottleneck of dyslexic readers' second-language learning lies at the level of word representations or smaller units and whether the amplitude of mismatch negativity is correlated with native-language literacy and related skills. We found that the activation of brain representations for familiar second-language words, but not for second-language speech sounds or native-language words, was weaker in children with Dyslexia_HP than in typical readers. Source localization revealed that Dyslexia_HP was associated with weak activation of the Right_HP temporal cortex, which has been previously linked with word-form learning. Importantly, the amplitude of the mismatch negativity for familiar second-language words correlated with native-language literacy and rapid naming scores, suggesting a close link between second-language processing and these skills.

Auditive training effects from a dichotic listening app in children with Dyslexia_HP.Dichotic listening (DL) taps information on the brain's language Laterality_HP, processing, and attention. Research has shown that DL responses in Dyslexia_HP deviate from the typical pattern. Here, effects of DL training and its correspondence to rapid naming (RAN) and digit span (DS) in typical children and children with Dyslexia_HP were assessed. Three groups of third graders participated: two training groups, control training (CT) and Dyslexia_HP training (DT), and a control group that received no training (control no training, CnT). All took part in testing pretraining and posttraining. DL measures were on Laterality_HP, response scores, and attention. The three groups showed different response patterns: minor changes in CnT, change in all measures in CT, and some changes in DT. RAN and DS scores correlated significantly with some of the DL measures, especially with the attention scores. Our findings support arguments that brain architecture for language in Dyslexia_HP is lateralised in the same way as in children without Dyslexia_HP. However, the ability to modulate attention during DL is weaker in Dyslexia_HP than in typically developing children. A training-induced normalisation of lateralisation was observed in free recall in the Dyslexia_HP group, which suggests that DL training may be a promising intervention approach.

Our findings support arguments that brain architecture for language in dyslexia is lateralised in the same way as in children without dyslexia. However, the ability to modulate attention during DL is weaker in dyslexia than in typically developing children. A training-induced normalisation of lateralisation was observed in free recall in the dyslexia group, which suggests that DL training may be a promising intervention approach.
Development of verb inflections among Bangla-speaking children with Language_impairment_HP.Children with Language_impairment_HP across languages have problems with verb morphology. The nature of these problems varies according to the typology of the language. The language analyzed in this paper is the Standard Bangla spoken in Dhaka, Bangladesh, by more than 200 million people. It is an underexplored language with agglutinative features in its verb inflections. Some information on the acquisition of the language by typically developing children is available, but to date we have no information on the nature of ALD. As in many places in the developing world, the circumstances for research into Language_impairment_HP are challenging, as there is no well-ordered infrastructure for the identification of these children and approaches to intervention are not evidence based. This study represents the first attempt to characterize the nature of morphosyntactic limitations in standard Bangla-speaking children with Language_impairment_HP.

Deficient Letter-Speech Sound Integration Is Associated With Deficits in Reading but Not Spelling.Efficient and automatic integration of letters and speech sounds is assumed to enable fluent word recognition and may in turn also underlie the build-up of high-quality orthographic representations, which are relevant for accurate spelling. While previous research showed that developmental Dyslexia_HP is associated with deficient letter-speech sound integration, these studies did not differentiate between subcomponents of literacy skills. In order to investigate whether deficient letter-speech sound integration is associated with deficits in reading and/or spelling, three groups of third graders were recruited: (1) children with combined deficits in reading and spelling (RSD,

Cognitive and emotional challenges in children with reading difficulties.Dyslexia_HP is characterised by a primary difficulty in both reading and cognitive control. Children with reading difficulties also experience a broad range of social and emotional difficulties, such as low self-esteem, Anxiety_ASDPTO_HP and Depression_ASDPTO. The aim of the study was to determine whether there is a linkage between emotional and cognitive-control difficulties and challenges in reading in children with reading difficulties compared to typical readers.

The Book Dog and Semiotic Resources in Envisionment Building of a Text World.The Linnaeus University project "The Book Dog and Astrid Lindgren" seeks to bring children and literature together and to use the dog as a tool for this. The method involves children reading aloud to trained dogs, called book dogs. By studying the practice of the book dog, we seek more Profound_HP knowledge of the importance of the reading practice for children's reading. Such knowledge can have didactic implications for reading practices also in contexts where there is no book dog. In the study reception theories (Langer in Envisioning knowledge. Building literacy in the academic disciplines, New York, Teachers College Press, 2011a; Langer in Envisioning literature. Literary understanding and literature instruction, 2nd ed., New York, Teachers College Press, 2011b) are developed with perspectives of discourse analysis (Fairclough in Discourse and social change, Polity Press, Cambridge, 1992). and social semiotics (Halliday in Language as social semiotics. The social interpretation of language and meaning, Edward Arnold, London, 1978). The result shows that the dog contributes with semiotic resources in the meaning-making process; the text world comes to life for the child through the expanded envisionment building where the dog is Central_HP. Since pupils read texts in all school subjects, the study should be relevant for all types of teachers when shaping reading practices that support pupil's meaning-making, also in contexts where there is no book dog. The study can also say something about what engagement, attentiveness, and non-judgemental attitudes can mean for pupils, even they in Reading_and_Writing_ASDPTO difficulties (Bergh Nestlog and Ehriander 2016).
