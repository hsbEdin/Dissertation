 nonsyndromic intellectual disability with novel heterozygous scn a mutation and epilepsy scn a mutations are primarily associated with a variety of epilepsy syndromes recently scn a has been reported as a gene responsible for nonsyndromic intellectual disability or autism spectrum disorders here we present a case of a year old girl with nonsyndromic intellectual disability who exhibited a heterozygous de novo missense mutation in scn a she developed seizures during the course of illness this case suggests that the phenotype of patients with heterozygous scn a mutations can be variable the sodium voltage gated channel alpha subunit scn a gene is mainly and highly expressed in the brain many heterozygous variants of scn a are associated with a variety of human epilepsy syndromes many are benign syndromes such as benign familial neonatal infantile seizures bfnis benign familial infantile seizures bfis generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus gefs and intractable childhood epilepsy furthermore scn a is occasionally responsible for dravet syndrome which is a rare and malignant epilepsy syndrome usually developing in the first year of life dravet syndrome is now used as a disease entity which includes severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy smei and its borderline phenotype smeb the functional consequences of mutant sodium channels range from loss to gain of function scn a mutations associated with intractable epilepsy alter the channel properties of the sodium channel voltage gated type ii nav to a greater extent than bfnis mutations do suggesting a mechanism for more severe epileptic phenotypes however other phenotype genotype correlations are unknown for scn a mutations moreover scn a appears to be one of the major genes in which mutations are detected in nonsyndromic intellectual disability id or autism spectrum disorders asds by whole exome sequencing herein we present a case of an atypical patient with nonsyndromic id and with a heterozygous missense mutation detected by clinical exome sequencing although the patient was assumed to have nonsyndromic id only she developed seizures during the course of her illness the patient was a year old japanese girl born to nonconsanguineous healthy parents with no family history of the disease the pregnancy was uneventful the girl was born at weeks of gestation with a birth weight of g length of cm and head circumference of cm her motor development milestones were within the normal limit however it was noted that she spoke no words and was not able to point to an object at one and a half years old and consequently she was referred to our hospital examinations including brain mri did not determine the cause of her developmental delay she was developing slowly never showed any progressive symptoms and was followed up as a case of nonsyndromic id of unknown cause she began to speak single meaningful words at the age of years her height weight and head circumference were appropriate for her age she could speak two word sentences but often repeated words or phrases electroencephalogy eeg showed spike bursts in the bilateral parietal occipital region since one and a half years old however she had no seizures nor did she have any other symptoms dysmorphic appearance or complications her intelligence quotient was karyotyping and microarray comparative genomic hybridization found no pathogenic variants she developed absence seizures and began taking valproic acid which controlled the seizures at the age of written informed consent was obtained from the parents of the patient in accordance with the requirements of the kanagawa children's medical center review board and ethics committee total genomic dna was obtained from lymphocytes using the qiaamp dna blood mini kit qiagen valencia ca usa following the manufacturer's instructions dna libraries were enriched for sequences using the trusight one sequencing panel kit illumina inc san diego ca usa which enables enrichment and final analysis of a panel of genes patient samples were sequenced using the miseq platform illumina inc with bp pair end reads data were analyzed by the burrows wheeler alignment tool and the genome analysis toolkit pipeline broad institute cambridge ma usa and visualized in the integrative genomics viewer igv calling copy number variation cnv was based on log ratio analysis and read depth z score of each exon mutations identified by targeted sequencing were confirmed by sanger sequencing and appropriate segregation was demonstrated by the phenotype in the unaffected parents targeted sequencing identified a novel scn a mutation in the patient the mutation c g c p g r nm_ was in the coding region of exon the mutation was absent in a human genetic variation database the

mutationtaster sanger sequencing demonstrated that the mutation was de novo this patient showed a novel phenotype for heterozygous scn a mutations scn a mutations are mainly responsible for various types of epilepsy syndrome most of which are benign additionally scn a mutations are rated second among gene mutations in nonsyndromic id patients or asd patients both nonsyndromic id and asd are development related diseases and sometimes overlap because there are few clinical descriptions of each case of these diseases it is difficult to distinguish between them a few cases with dysmorphic features and or brain anomalies have been reported there were pathogenic mutations registered as of april in the human genome mutation database http www hgmd cf ac uk which were randomly distributed across the entire scn a gene of these mutations most variants were missense mutations missense mutations tend to lead to seizure development fig a b the mutations causing nonsyndromic id or asd are variable fig c there is a tendency for nonsense mutations splicing mutations small insertions deletions and gross deletions to be responsible for nonsyndromic id or asd however regarding nonsyndromic id or asd and epilepsy the genotype phenotype correlation is still unclear although there are several cases of id or asd patients with heterozygous scn a mutations who also have seizures little has been reported on the detailed clinical course at least they have had seizures since the infantile period the clinical course of our patient may represent a novel distinct phenotype of heterozygous scn a mutation syndrome further studies will identify the characteristic features of this phenotype from a clinical standpoint when managing nonepileptic id or asd patients with scn a mutations clinicians should be aware of the possibility of seizure development genetic diagnosis may be useful to choose an antiepileptic medication furthermore eeg must be performed regularly as mentioned above the genotype phenotype correlation is not completely established there are some reports that mention a correlation between mutated genes and antiepileptic drugs further study can evaluate and predict the prognosis and the ratio of epilepsy in patients with scn a mutations in conclusion we present a case of a nonsyndromic id patient with a de novo heterozygous missense mutation in the scn a gene who developed seizures this case suggests that nonsyndromic id or asd patients with scn a mutations are likely to develop seizures this patient exhibited a novel phenotype for heterozygous scn a variants and the case provides novel insights into the genotype phenotype correlation for scn a variants further study is required
 heterozygous deletion of scn a and scn a in a patient with autism spectrum disorder and tourette syndrome a case report mutations in voltage gated sodium channel scn genes are supposed to be of importance in the etiology of psychiatric and neurological diseases in particular in the etiology of seizures previous studies report a potential susceptibility region at the chromosomal locus q including scn a scn a and scn a genes for autism spectrum disorder asd to date there is no previous description of a patient with comorbid asd and tourette syndrome showing a deletion containing scn a and scn a we present the unique complex case of a year old male patient suffering from developmental retardation and exhibiting a range of behavioral traits since birth he received the diagnoses of asd in early childhood and of tourette syndrome in adulthood according to icd and dsm criteria investigations of underlying genetic factors yielded a heterozygous microdeletion of approximately kb at

tourette syndrome and possible implications for treatment keywords autism spectrum disorder asd tourette syndrome scn a scn a mutations in neuronal voltage gated sodium channel genes such as scn a scn a and scn a are supposed to play an important role in psychiatric disorders and neurological diseases these three sodium channel genes encoding distinct subunit isoforms are clustered within kb on chromosome q and are highly expressed in neurons and glia throughout the central and peripheral nervous system genome wide scan studies for autism susceptibility genes reported a potential susceptibility region at locus q including scn a scn a and scn a genes dravet syndrome ds is a childhood disorder associated with mainly loss of function mutations in the scn a gene it is characterized by frequent seizures and devastating effects on cognitive and behavioural development persisting into adulthood while approximately of ds patients show mutations in scn a some patients have variants in other genes including scn a mutations of the scn a gene have also been reported in patients with autism as well as with benign familial infantile seizures intractable epilepsy infantile spasms and severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy previous investigations mainly led to case reports with deletions on chromosome q being associated with seizures complicated by neurobehavioral comorbidities such as cognitive impairment psychiatric disorders and social problems to date there are only two published cases with deletions on chromosome q displaying a phenotype with autistic features and developmental delay but no seizures celle et al described the case of a year old boy presenting with autistic features language delay microcephaly and no history of seizures he had an interstitial deletion of kb at band q with loss of the entire scn a gene and part of the scn a gene another case report described a years and months old girl with autistic features

as loc flj loc fign and taip until now there is no description of a patient with scn gene mutations and autism spectrum disorder asd with additional symptoms of tourette syndrome we present the unique case of a year old male patient displaying a complex clinical picture with mental retardation and various behavioural problems since birth symptoms of the autism spectrum comprising difficulties in social interaction and communication are reported since childhood additionally he suffers from auto aggressive tics in terms of beating himself with objects against his head and lower jaw head movement tics and simple vocal tics striking dysmorphic features are not evident except a one time bleeding in week of gestation pregnancy had been without any complications no infections medication smoking or intake of alcohol or drugs during pregnancy was reported the patient was delivered in week of gestation with the help of a ventouse due to irregular cardiac activity during delivery there were minor signs of birth asphyxia birth weight was g th percentile birth length cm th percentile and head circumference cm rd percentile during infancy a prominent frontal fissure was conspicuous a premature ossification of the sagittal fissure could not be detected the patient showed psychomotor retardation he walked alone only by months and was not able to sit alone falling over to one side without shoring up even at the age of furthermore tics in terms of eye blinking as well as a muscular hypotonia were described the patient's parents reported early autistic features such as difficulties in social communication and interaction with avoiding eye contact and poor interest in social interaction development of speech was delayed first words with months he refused body contact and demonstrated stereotypic patterns of behaviour such as filling bowls without showing any variations when examined at the age of months the patient presented some special facial features such as synophrys epicanthus modelled ears a deep joined thumb and microcephaly his weight was kg rd percentile his length cm th percentile and his head circumference cm cm above the rd percentile the patient only spoke a few words and never a whole sentence mostly he only repeated the words he had heard before in terms of an echolalia a considerable general delay of development with severe perceptual disturbance and autistic traits was diagnosed since the age of two years the patient shows relevant aggressive symptoms such as throwing his head on the floor or biting into items he needs extensive support concerning all activities of daily living and requires constant daily routines during nursery school auto aggressive symptoms exacerbated in terms of head banging behaviour injuring his jaw and ears at the age of years he started grinding his teeth later on he presented head throwing movements against his left shoulder and banging of one row of his teeth against the other there was a pattern of aggravation of the tic symptoms during stressful situations he repeatedly showed refusal of meals and sleeping disturbances at the age of years once there was a query febrile convulsion associated with an infection apart from that there was no evidence for further seizures and clearly no epilepsy according to icd and dsm classification the clinical features of the patient are consistent with early infantile autism as well as with tourette syndrome in the clinical examination the patient presented with cauliflower ears as a result of his head banging behaviour and subsequent repetitive ear injuries as well as various injuries of all kinds and healing stages dysmorphic features or additional external malformations were not noted there was no evidence of internal abnormalities heart eye inner ear either the patient showed a preserved ability of speech comprehension with rare speech production conventional r banded karyotyping of the patient was performed according to standard protocols with a resolution of approximately bphs and revealed a structurally and numerically normal male karyotype xy in all metaphases examined furthermore the genomic dna of

resonance imaging conducted in showed no abnormalities of the patient's brain in a detailed investigation was performed with a metabolic screening of serum urine and cerebrospinal fluid revealing normal results in the eeg there was a slow baseline activity without any epilepsy suspicious potentials a proton spectroscopy showed no abnormalities of n acetyl aspartate choline and phosphor creatinine levels an ophthalmologic investigation exhibited no deviations in gastrointestinal passage was unsuspicious and in an x ray of the brain no stenosis of the sagittal fissure was confirmed in the present case report we describe a year old male patient with symptoms of an early infantile autism as well as a tourette syndrome he carries a kb deletion on chromosome q including the genes scn a and scn a which code for voltage gated sodium channels to date no similar case has been described in the literature with respect to the phenotype of autism spectrum disorder plus tourette syndrome but without epilepsy the patient showed a global retardation of development including psychomotor and language delay various autistic traits echolalia severe auto aggressive symptoms in terms of head banging tic specific head movements and vocal tics there might have been one febrile convulsion at age however clearly there was no diagnosis of epilepsy no other seizures had ever been reported the somatic abnormalities included dysmorphic features such as synophrys epicanthus modelled ears a deep joined thumb and microcephaly to date there are only two case reports referring to patients with autistic features language impairment dysmorphic features and no history of seizures presenting a deletion of scn a and scn a genes chen et al described the most similar case to the one presented in this report he presented a years and months old girl with autistic features developmental delay mental retardation language impairment dysmorphic features and no history of seizures with a mb de novo deletion on chromosome q entailing loss of nine genes including scn a scn a grb and cobll bartnik et al identified a de novo kb deletion involving exons of scn a and non coding exon a of scn a in a year old female with mental retardation neurobehavioural and psychiatric abnormalities and a history of infantile seizures additionally there are several other case reports presenting patients with a deletion on chromosome q with current seizures or a history of seizures in all previous case reports no additional symptoms of tourette syndrome have been described to date the presently available literature suggests that mutations in scn a can be causative for asd benign familial neonatal infantile seizures intractable epilepsy infantile spasms and severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy since sodium channels are critical for action potential generation and propagation a causative association between seizures and sodium channel dysfunction is plausible whereas it is more difficult to understand this link for asd and tics it is proposed that loss of function scn a mutations associated with seizures cause reduced gaba release leading to an inappropriate inhibition in related neuronal networks parvalbumin neurons represent inhibitory gabaergic cells that are involved in various forms of feed forward inhibition within the striatum postmortem studies in patients with tourette syndrome demonstrate a consistent and profound imbalance of parvalbumin positive neuronal distribution in the basal ganglia the selective deficit of parvalbumin positive and cholinergic striatal interneurons in tourette syndrome was supposed to result in an impaired cortico thalamic control of striatal neuron firing evidence from studies demonstrates that na v the protein encoded by scn a is abundant in parvalbumin positive gabaergic inhibitory interneurons at least in the hippocampus and the temporal lobe apart from scn a and scn a genes being affected by the presently detected deletion grb exon to intron cobll and slc a were also deleted in our patient thus heterozygous deletion of these genes might also play a pivotal role in conferring asd symptoms and could even be suggested to confer symptoms of tourette syndrome in the present case loss of slc a a putative sodium coupled neutral amino acid transporter might enhance the effects of scn a and scn a deletion the cobll gene encoding the cordon bleu wh repeat protein like was suggested to be a negative regulator of apoptosis and associated with lower insulin resistance a deletion on chromosome q encompassing genes including scn a scn a and cobll was reported in a patient with severe epilepsy grb encodes a growth factor receptor binding protein acting as an inhibitor of intracellular signaling pathways regulating growth and metabolism one previous investigation reported a deletion on chromosome q comprising grb and cobll in a patient with autistic features developmental delay mental retardation language impairment and dysmorphic features in this case additional repetitive hand movements have been described therefore it is possible that deletions of grb and cobll may contribute to tic symptoms an association of the above mentioned affected genes with tourette syndrome proper however has not been reported in the presently available literature from our point of view the deletion therefore adequately explains the patient's symptomatology furthermore whole genome sequencing could provide further information on whether additional mutations variants are present in the patient's autistic brother contributing to the development of autistic symptoms in the patient concerning treatment of scn gene mutations existing literature is really scarce a causal treatment of deletions in chromosomal area q is not available to date a substitution of the missing gene products of the patient is not possible promising studies reported a scn a mutation in a chinese boy with infantile spasm responding to a modified atkins diet it is an alternative ketogenic diet with results demonstrating efficacy in the treatment of intractable seizures evidence shows that ketones produced after a modified atkins diet could reduce neuron excitability by inhibiting glutamate transport and activating atp sensitive potassium channels currently there are no publications available investigating the effect of a ketogenic diet on tic disorders or tourette syndrome a review concluded that for the treatment of ds which is often caused by loss of function mutations in scn a valproate and benzodiazepines should be the first line treatment but are often insufficient topiramate and levetiracetam bromide and ketogenic diet provide efficacy as adjunctive therapy lamotrigine and carbamazepine should be avoided as they are supposed to lead to an increased occurrence of seizures another promising drug is stiripentol showing efficacy in a combination with valproate and clobazam among patients with ds a treatment with cannabidiol resulted in a reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo nevertheless higher rates of adverse events have been reported for the future further research into targeted treatment options for scn a and scn a deletions is warranted previous studies primarily focused on patients with seizures and reported about medication with antiepileptic drugs or atkins diets in our case the patient presented additional symptoms of tourette syndrome but no epilepsy it remains to be elucidated whether the heterozygous loss of scn a and

 atypical rett syndrome and intractable epilepsy with novel grin b mutation rett syndrome is a genetic disorder most often caused by a mutation in the mecp gene whole exome sequencing has implicated a growing number of other genetic causes we present a female with atypical rett syndrome and intractable epilepsy caused by a previously unreported pathogenic variant in grin b the patient was apparently normal until months of age when her development began to stagnate her head circumference at birth was normal and her head growth decelerated postnatally she walked at age years but gradually lost the ability in late childhood she never developed speech she had midline hand stereotypies aerophagia bruxism peripheral vasomotor changes and impaired sleep she was diagnosed with variant rett syndrome based on the clinical diagnostic criteria in use at the time brain magnetic resonance imaging at age years was normal negative genetic investigations included chromosomal microarray q q methylation testing for angelman syndrome and genetic analysis of mecp foxg cdkl and wdr subsequent research based whole exome sequencing identified a de novo variant in grin b nm_ c t c p l p epileptic seizures began at age years with both generalized tonic and tonic clonic patterns she has remained medically refractory despite numerous antiepileptic drug trials involving different combinations of dilantin lacosamide levetiracetam valproic acid topiramate gabapentin clobazam and rufinamide seizure frequency at age years was up to tonic seizures per day with about half progressing to a clonic phase electroencephalograms showed interictal generalized discharges and tonic seizures given the intractability of her seizures and the finding of a grin b variant memantine mg twice daily was added to her existing regimen of phenytoin levetiracetam and lacosamide it was discontinued at month follow up after a slight worsening in seizure frequency was reported the grin b gene encodes a subunit of the n methyl d aspartate nmda receptor which is a glutamate activated ion channel found at excitatory synapses throughout the brain grin b encephalopathy is a newly described disorder causing developmental disability with or without seizures platzer et al described individuals with de novo heterozygous grin b mutations while the phenotype is variable have severe intellectual disability over half have childhood onset epilepsy and approximately half of those with epilepsy are medically refractory only have a history of regression which is a mandatory criterion for a diagnosis of rett syndrome our patient met clinical diagnostic criteria for atypical rett syndrome while presenting with intractable epilepsy which is atypical for rett syndrome caused by mecp mutations the original clinical diagnosis of variant rett syndrome was made when our patient was a preschool aged child and was based on the existing clinical diagnostic criteria although the pivotal role of pathogenic variants in the mecp gene in classic and atypical rett syndrome was already known in both hagberg et al and neul et al elected to continue to base the diagnosis of rett syndrome exclusively on clinical grounds a decision that resulted in some controversy with the gradual discovery that rett like features were an important part of the phenotypes seen in pathogenic variants of other genes whose products were functionally linked to mecp eg cdkl foxg wdr a parallel nomenclature has evolved based on gene diagnosis mecp related disorders cdkl related disorders and so on thus from the gene diagnosis perspective our patient has grin b related disorder two recent papers each report a grin b pathogenic variant detected with whole exome sequencing in groups of patients with rett syndrome and rett like presentations additional clinical details were not provided to allow comparisons with our patient another patient with a loss of function grin b variant and rett like features was described however that paper was retracted because of inadvertent use of l serine as a treatment instead of the intended d serine the clinical description did not specify the presence of regression but included motor delays behavioral abnormalities hand stereotypies and impaired sleep memantine an nmda receptor antagonist has been proposed as a selective treatment for gain of function mutations in glun subunits such as grin b platzer et al showed that memantine can reduce nmda receptor hyperactivity in vitro however treatment of individuals with gain of function variants in grin b with memantine did not significantly reduce seizure frequency we observed worsening of seizure activity in our patient this case highlights that grin b variants can cause atypical rett syndrome with medically refractory epilepsy and that there is a growing need for an understanding of the underlying pathophysiology based on the patient's genotype with this information new targeted treatments for these patients can be developed
 growth hormone deficiency as a cause for short stature in wiedemann steiner syndrome wiedemann steiner syndrome wss is a rare condition characterised by short stature hypertrichosis of the elbow intellectual disability and characteristic facial dysmorphism due to heterozygous loss of function mutations in kmt a a gene encoding a histone lysine methyltransferase children with wss are often short and until recently it had been assumed that short stature is an intrinsic part of the syndrome ghd has recently been reported as part of the phenotypic spectrum of wss we describe the case of an year old boy with a novel heterozygous variant in kmt a and features consistent with a diagnosis of wss who also had growth hormone deficiency ghd ghd was diagnosed on dynamic function testing for growth hormone gh secretion low insulin like growth factor i igf i levels and pituitary specific mri demonstrating anterior pituitary hypoplasia and an ectopic posterior pituitary treatment with gh improved height performance with growth trajectory being normalised to the parental height range our case highlights the need for gh testing in children with wss and short stature as treatment with gh improves growth trajectory growth hormone deficiency might be part of the phenotypic spectrum of wiedemann steiner syndrome wss investigation of pituitary function should be undertaken in children with wss and short stature a pituitary mr scan should be considered if there is biochemical evidence of growth hormone deficiency ghd recombinant human growth hormone treatment should be considered for treatment of ghd wiedemann steiner syndrome wss omim is a rare genetic disorder characterised by psychomotor delay facial dysmorphism hypertrichosis especially of the elbow and growth retardation wss results from heterozygous loss of function kmt a mutations recently it has been reported that of patients with wss have growth hormone deficiency ghd however no details of endocrine investigations were provided in these patients we report endocrine and imaging studies in a patient with genetically confirmed wss and ghd and his response to therapy with gh proband years male was born to non consanguineous parents of white european origin by normal delivery at weeks weighing kg sds with evidence of intra uterine growth restriction on antenatal ultrasound scanning vesico ureteric reflux mild hydronephrosis and hydroureter had been identified in early life at years of age he presented with short stature height cm sds decreasing height velocity and poor weight gain weight kg sds fig a a review at years of age showed that his height cm at age years sds and weight kg sds had remained suboptimal his height was well below the mid parental height cm sds investigations ruled out malabsorption although several allergies soya and raw eggs were noted the coeliac screen was normal initial endocrine investigations showed low levels of the gh dependent peptide igf i g l range for age with other pituitary functions remaining normal the cause for low igf i was attributed to low body weight instead of ghd although the patient did not have obvious features of ghd other than short stature growth hormone dynamic stimulation testing was performed as per local protocol glucagon stimulated gh levels were low basal peak g l expected values g l suggesting biochemical evidence for ghd mr scanning of the pituitary and brain showed a hypoplastic anterior pituitary with an elongated posterior pituitary extending into the pituitary stalk minor ectopic posterior pituitary in keeping with a developmental abnormality of the pituitary gland fig b as the patient demonstrated an abnormal growth hormone response to stimulation and demonstrated radiological evidence of pituitary hypoplasia ectopia a second stimulation test was not performed in keeping with local protocol the patient was commenced on recombinant human gh treatment in a dose of g kg day to which satisfactory height gain was achieved within the first year while pre treatment height velocity was cm year post treatment height velocity increased to cm year satisfactory height trajectory height cm at years sds was maintained in follow up appointments with gh treatment administered in doses varying between and g kg day ghd continued to be isolated with no evidence of wider pituitary dysfunction the patient was reviewed again at age years by this time intellectual disability and an autistic spectrum disorder had been identified dysmorphism including long eyelashes thick arched eyebrows downslanting and vertically narrow palpebral fissures hypertelorism low set ears ptosis and mild facial asymmetry was noted the patient's dna was analysed for a next generation sequencing ngs based panel of intellectual disability genes a novel heterozygous kmt a variant c delc p ser leufster refseq id nm_ predicted to be deleterious was identified reverse phenotyping confirmed that the phenotypic features were consistent with wss targeted parental testing confirmed that the variant had arisen de novo wss is a rare genetic disease with variable phenotypes of presentation short stature is a recognised feature of wss the molecular basis for short stature has not been ascertained but had been assumed to be intrinsic to the genetic defect a recent observational study suggested that ghd could be frequent in children with wss this study did not describe the methods by which ghd was diagnosed or report the response to gh treatment as dynamic function testing has high false positive frequency the validity of ghd diagnosis in wss patients remains to be confirmed in contrast our case study has demonstrated auxological biochemical and radiological evidence confirming ghd our findings suggest the possibility of a structural pituitary lesion in wss causing ghd and short stature therefore we would recommend thorough investigation of pituitary function in all children diagnosed with wss including a pituitary mr scan if there is biochemical evidence of ghd the combination of decelerating growth velocity low gh to dynamic function testing low igf i and mr scan findings of hypoplastic anterior pituitary ectopic posterior pituitary and satisfactory and sustained treatment response to gh are highly suggestive of a diagnosis of ghd the possibility of ghd occurring as a chance association remains to be confirmed although the observation of ghd in of wss patients points towards a stronger and more intrinsic association the latter is in contrast to the clinical experience in our centre where only one out of seven children with wss had confirmed ghd the long term outcome of gh treatment in patients with wss has not been previously reported in our patient growth response was excellent to modest doses of gh treatment over a year follow up period on regular monitoring gh dependent peptides igf i and igfbp remained within the normal range no adverse events from gh administration were noted there was no observed alteration in phenotypic characteristics of wss our patient continues to be treated as any other child with ghd with strict monitoring for efficacy and adverse events arising from gh treatment it remains to be seen if our patient develops wider pituitary dysfunction experiences a pubertal growth spurt and if final height is appropriate for the parental height potential wss is caused by kmt a mutations kmt a encodes a histone lysine methyltransferase our observation indicates that kmt a may have a role in pituitary development several other developmental disorders caused by mutations in histone lysine methyltransferases kmts are known of these kmt d mutations that cause kabuki syndrome ks omim are notable this is because gh deficiency has also been described in patients with ks chd encodes a reader for h k marks laid down by kmt d chd mutations cause charge syndrome omim growth retardation is one of the cardinal features of charge syndrome and ghd has also been described in patients with charge we conclude that our case report illustrates the need to investigate pituitary function in particular for gh secretion in all children diagnosed with wss and short stature treatment with recombinant human gh could be considered as an option to improve height gain in patients with wss and ghd
 description of the molecular and phenotypic spectrum of wiedemann steiner syndrome in chinese patients wiedemann steiner syndrome wdsts is a rare genetic disorder characterized by facial gestalt neurodevelopmental delay skeletal anomalies and growth retardation which is caused by variation of kmt a gene to date only chinese wdsts patients have been reported here we report the phenotypes and kmt a gene variations in unrelated chinese wdsts patients and investigate the phenotypic differences between the chinese and french cohorts next generation sequencing was performed for each patient and the variants in the kmt a gene were validated by sanger sequencing the phenotypes of chinese wdsts patients were summarized and compared to french patients genetic sequencing identified deleterious de novo kmt a variants in patients including truncating missenses and splicing variants of the variants are novel and two have been reported previously one of the patients is mosaic in the kmt a gene the variation spectra and phenotypic profiles of the chinese wdsts patients showed no difference with patients of other ethnicities however differ in the frequencies of several clinical features we demonstrated that variations in the kmt a gene can lead to both advanced and delayed bone age we identified novel phenotypes which include microcephaly deep palmar crease external ear deformity carpal epiphyseal growth retardation dyslipidemia and glossoptosis in addition patients harbored missense variants in the cxxc zinc finger domain of kmt a showed more severe neurophenotypes our study consists of the largest cohort of chinese wdsts patients that continues to expand the wdsts phenotypic and variation spectrum our results support the notion that the cxxc zinc finger domain of kmt a gene is a hotspot for missense variants associated with more severe neurophenotypes the online version of this article s contains supplementary material which is available to authorized users keywords wiedemann steiner syndrome kmt a variation chinese patients phenotypic differences wiedemann steiner syndrome wdsts omim is a pleiotropic and extremely rare autosomal dominant disorder which was first reported by wiedemann et al in and later described by steiner et al in using whole exome sequencing wes jones et al revealed that germline heterozygous variations of the kmt a gene omim was responsible for wdsts in five patients in the kmt a gene also known as mll encodes a histone lysine methyltransferase that plays a critical role in regulating gene expression during early development and hematopoiesis because kmt a regulates multiple hox and wnt genes through histone h lysine h k methylation phenotypes of the wdsts patients are complex and involve multiple systems including facial features skeletal development and neuro development a recent summary study pointed out that the clinical features of developmental delay dd intellectual disability id postnatal growth retardation palpebral fissures down slanted wide nasal bridge broad nasal tip long eyelashes and thick eyebrows are more common in wdsts patients increasing number of wdsts patients of different ethnicities are being identified due to the rapid advance of dna sequencing technologies which continues to expand the phenotype spectra with novel features to date at least wdsts patients with variations in kmt a gene were confirmed of whom only two are chinese though most of the features in the two chinese patients are similar to patients of other ethnicities whether the absent palmar proximal transverse creases is a unique feature of chinese patients and whether there are novel phenotypes in chinese patients remain unclear meanwhile our knowledge on the phenotype spectrum and variation spectrum of chinese patients are still very limited here we studied the phenotypes and kmt a variations of unrelated chinese wdsts patients we identified de novo heterozygous variants in the kmt a gene including truncating missense and splicing variants of them are novel the phenotypes of chinese wdsts patients were compared with a french cohort in addition we hereby report several novel clinical features of wdsts including macrocephaly deep palmar crease external ear deformity carpal epiphyseal growth retardation dyslipidemia and glossoptosis a total of chinese patients females and males aged from years to years old were enrolled from shanghai children's medical center jiangxi provincial children's hospital shanghai first maternity and infant hospital chongqing children's hospital and chengdu women's and children's central hospital in china all patients' parents are unaffected and non consanguineous in our study for patients and proband only targeted ngs using inherited disease panel including disease causing genes cat no agilent technologies inc santa clara ca usa was performed in shanghai children's medical center as described previously for patients and proband only targeted ngs was performed by a commercial company mygenostics inc beijing china using a clinical exome capture panel containing disease causing genes for patient trio based wes was performed by the short stature sequencing program variants detected by ngs were confirmed by sanger sequencing in each patient and their parents when the samples were available the statistical analysis between two cohorts was performed by chi square test using the spss statistical package for the social sciences inc chicago il usa in data statistics p is considered of suggestive significance we identified different kmt a variants truncating missense splicing table and additional file table s with patient and patient harboring the same truncating variant p ser valfs the two missense variants occurred in the cxxc zinc finger domain p gly asp and the set domain p arg cys respectively additional file table s multiple in silico tools predict deleterious outcomes of these two missense variants p gly asp scored in sift in polyphen in mutationtaster and in cadd p arg cys scored in sift in polyphen in mutationtaster and in cadd of the identified variants are novel and the p gly asp and p ser valfs variants have been reported previously except the variants identified in patient whose mothers' sample was not available the other variants were confirmed to be de novo according to the variant interpretation guidelines from the american college of medical genetics and genomics and the association for molecular pathology the missense variants were classified as likely pathogenic and the others are pathogenic in additional a total of x of the base at c in patient was sequenced interestingly the variant allele a has much lower proportion x when compared to the wild type allele t x which is confirmed by sanger sequencing additional file figure s indicating mosaicism in the patient to fully describe the clinical features of chinese wdsts patients previously reported patients were included in our analysis to make the sample size a comprehensive list of clinical presentation is summarized in table table and figs and in summary the most frequent with frequency clinical features in chinese wdsts patients were as follows long eyelashes id thick hair delay in language development low hair line hypertelorism downturned corners of the mouth down turned palpebral fissures vertically narrow palpebral fissures high palate hypertrichosis on back postnatal growth retardation for height and delayed bone age additionally six clinical features were reported in wdsts patients for the first time including macrocephaly in patient external ear deformity in patients and fig fig a a deep palmar crease in patient fig fig b b carpal epiphyseal growth retardation in patient fig fig b b dyslipidemia in patient with mild increased in cholesterol level mmol l normal range mmol l and low density in lipoprotein level mmol l normal range mmol l and glossoptosis in patient patient received rehabilitation training to improve the gross motor development before years old patient received growth hormone gh therapy iu kg d mg kg d for months and had a cm gain in height cm month the gh treatment effect of patient is similar with a recently reported wdsts patient whose height velocity increased to cm year patient was initially diagnosed with puberty variation with bilateral breast development for the past months at year minth old she was therefore treated with gonadotrophin releasing hormone gnrh analogue to inhibit the rapid sexual development hoping to improve her adult height the latest evaluation of patient at year month old showed well controlled of the breast development and the normal levels of sex hormones hydroxyprogesterone adrenocorticotropic hormone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate patient is currently undergoing rehabilitation training to improve her gross motor development patient was naturally pregnant with triplets and thus she was provided with genetic counseling further examination revealed that one of the three fetuses had scoliosis and one had pulmonary artery atresia the family decided to take fetal reduction surgery to remove the fetus with scoliosis a recent follow up showed that the other two babies were born and the normal baby was confirmed to carry wild type kmt a gene by genetic testing unfortunately we were not able to get genetic information of the baby who had pulmonary artery atresia since the parents refused to have genetic testing on the baby patient had breathing difficulty after birth due to glossoptosis and micrognathia and thus he underwent a mandibular traction surgery at days of age for further understand wdsts we did statistical analysis for the phenotypes between the chinese patients and a cohort of french patients as shown in table no significant differences of age span gender distribution and the kmt a gene variant spectrum in the two cohorts the overall clinical feature profiles are similar in these two groups however several differences still can be observed three features of ptosis thick eyebrows and feeding difficulties showed significant statistical difference in the two cohorts the chinese cohort had higher frequency of ptosis but lower frequency of thick eyebrows and feeding difficulties in addition though no statistical difference was observed postnatal growth retardation microcephaly down turned palpebral fissures long eyelashes brachydactyly and delayed bone age were more frequent in the chinese cohort while the frequency of thin upper lip hyperopia and congenital heart malformations were higher in the french cohort in this study we recruited unrelated chinese wdsts patients to our knowledge this is the largest cohort of chinese wdsts patients with the greatest age span from pediatric to adult that have been reported recently sun et al reported two chinese male patients who presented with absent palmar proximal transverse creases which may be a unique characteristic of chinese wdsts patients we thus examined all the patients and found that no patients had abnormal palmar crease except for patient who had deep palmar crease fig c we speculate that the lack of abnormal palmar crease in patients of other ethnicities may be a result of negligence during phenotype assessment additionally we revealed several novel clinical features in wdsts patients including macrocephaly deep palmar crease external ear deformity carpal epiphyseal growth retardation dyslipidemia and glossoptosis though it seems that several clinical features have frequency differences in the chinese and french cohorts only ptosis thick eyebrows and feeding difficulties show statistical significance that might due to lack of enough chinese wdsts samples prior to the french cohort study delayed bone age had been reported in at least patients while significantly advanced bone age was first and only described in a year old female patient here the french cohort and our cohort reported another and patients presented with advanced bone age and delayed bone age respectively therefore we propose that both of advanced bone age and delayed bone age are authentic phenotype of wdsts caused by kmt a variation patients and had gh deficiency and also presented with postnatal growth retardation which are consistent with the results from the french cohort moreover maternity history of patient supports the surmise of normal fertility in female wdsts individuals which has also been reported in two french patients the french cohort reported a healthy unaffected father with very low proportion of mosaicism in the kmt a gene p arg trp who had two affected daughters intriguingly patient in our cohort was the first wdsts case reported with mosaicism in the kmt a gene c t a p tyr who on the other hand presented with more severe phenotypes as well as several previously unreported symptoms external ear deformity carpal epiphyseal growth retardation and dyslipidemia because wdsts can phenotypic overlap with pierpont syndrome cornelia de lange syndrome and kabuki syndrome the candidate genes causing the later three syndromes i e tbl xr nipbl smc a smc rad hdac kmt d and kmd a in our cohort have been excluded to date a total of kmt a variants spanning the whole protein have been identified including the variants identified in this study of which are point variants and only one is intragenic large deletion as shown in additional file table s of the point variants are truncating are missense and are splicing variants the p ser valfs variant in patients and has been previously reported in unrelated patients which qualifies ser as a hotspot for gene variation in kmt a other recurrent variants including p arg trp p cys tyr p gly asp this study p arg and p arg were also identified although we did not find hotspot variation region it is noteworthy that only missense variants occurred in the cysteine rich cxxc zinc finger domain additional file table s which is predicted to selectively bind to unmethylated cpg containing stretches of the target genes previous studies suggested that patients who harbor the missense variant in the cxxc dna binding domain may show more severe neurodevelopmental delay indeed in our cohort patient p gly asp has the most severe anomalies in neurological development in contrast patient who has a missense variant p arg cys in the set domain showed less neurological abnormalities although the set domain plays an important role in transcriptional activation via its h k methyltransferase activity in the french cohort patients patients harbored the missense variants in the cxxc dna binding domain of them showed severe id while only one patient with severe id was observed in the other patients of them had persistent hypotonia in the other patients and of them had seizures only one in the other patients these results further and firmly demonstrate the relationship between dysfunction in the cxxc dna binding domain and severe nuerophenotypes most of the kmt a variants generate truncated products the same in chinese patients that further suggest haploinsufficiency is the main pathogenesis of kmt a gene it is speculated that missense variants of the kmt a gene are more likely to cause wdsts by a dominant negative effect the hypothesis is supported by the fact that upregulation of the kmt a gene transcription in patient with p arg trp and site specific dna methylation changes driven by kmt a missense variants which might explain the missense variants in the cxxc dna binding domain linked to a more severe neurophenotypes nevertheless more functional study need be performed to figure out the molecular mechanism especially why there were only missense variants in this domain currently it is still difficult to have more conclusions of genotype and phenotype in wdsts patients due to its broad spectrum of phenotypes further studies should attempt elucidating the connection between genotype and phenotype with epigenotype in consideration in addition the clinical interventions for wdsts patients are yet limited for most patients symptomatic treatment such as rehabilitation training is the only option to improve the motor development results from patient in our study and another reported patients indicate that gh therapy may be an effective method to improve the height of patients with gh deficiency of course clinical safety should be taken into consideration when using growth hormone therapy in summary we report chinese wdsts patients with pathogenic variants in the kmt a gene including novel variants our detailed comparison between the chinese and french patients indicates no significant difference in phenotypic spectrum however the frequency of several symptoms were different we demonstrated that variation in the kmt a gene can lead to both advanced and delayed bone age the novel phenotypes including macrocephaly deep palmar crease external ear deformity carpal epiphyseal growth retardation dyslipidemia and glossoptosis further extended the wdsts phenotype spectrum our study supports the notion that the cxxc zinc finger domain is a hotspot region for missense variants which is associated with more severe neurophenotypes in addition growth curves and endocrine related problem need further investigation in the future
 a family with pten mutations with malignancy and an unusually high number of offspring with autism spectrum disorder a case report cowden's syndrome omim a rare genetic disorder incidence is caused by mutations of the tumor suppressor gene pten in this report we describe clinical manifestations of a year old patient diagnosed with cowden's syndrome and his family with pten mutations the family has an unusually high number of offspring with autism spectrum disorder except for his year old caucasian father all of our index case's living caucasian kindred three children brother and nephew had pten mutations and macrocephaly prior to genetic testing his mother and sister died of breast cancer at and years old respectively after pten mutation was identified our patient underwent complete thyroidectomy histology showing micropapillary carcinoma and right nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma all of his three children year old son and year old daughters have been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder his son and brother underwent total thyroidectomy his nephew had thyroid nodules management of cowden's syndrome requires clinical examinations and investigations every to months from years old or years before the family's earliest age of cancer diagnosis and should focus on all clinical manifestations associated with pten mutations to identify early abnormal changes in skin breasts thyroid endometrium gut and kidneys input from specialists across different disciplines is necessary we describe a man and his family with pten mutations who have increased risk of cancers and an unusually high number of offspring with autism spectrum disorder early recognition and close surveillance are vital in order to provide treatment and early screening for asymptomatic at risk relatives keywords cowden's syndrome pten hamartoma tumor syndrome mucocutaneous manifestations cowden's syndrome omim a rare autosomal dominant disorder with an incidence of about in is a clinically distinct syndrome of pten hamartoma tumor syndrome phts cowden's syndrome was first described by lloyd and dennis in who detailed the phenotypic findings in a year old patient rachel cowden after whom the condition was named originally cowden's disease cowden's syndrome is caused by germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene pten phosphate and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome mapped to q over mutations have been identified so far these mutations include changes in a small number of base pairs but deletions of a larger amount of genetic material from the pten gene may at times occur leading to the production of a dysfunctional pten enzyme the defective enzyme is unable to inhibit apoptosis or signal abnormal cells to die which contributes to cell proliferation cowden's syndrome is characterized by multiple hamartomas with an increased risk of benign or malignant tumors mucocutaneous manifestations primarily trichilemmomas and papillomatous papules along with acral keratoses are pathognomonic features that exhibit age related penetrance and are present in almost all individuals with cowden's syndrome by their third decade of life other features commonly observed in patients with cowden's syndrome include lhermitte duclos disease megencephaly macrocephaly dolicocephaly gastrointestinal polyps glycogenic acanthosis and tumors with breast cancer being the most common form of malignancy followed by thyroid and endometrial cancer diagnosis of cowden's syndrome is based on national comprehensive cancer network criteria the diagnostic criteria are subdivided into pathognomonic major and minor categories the clinical diagnosis can be made on the basis of pathognomonic mucocutaneous lesions alone if an individual exhibits one of the following six or more facial papules three of which must be trichilemmomas cutaneous facial papules and oral mucosal papillomatosis oral mucosal papillomatosis and acral keratosis or six or more palmoplantar keratoses macrocephaly along with breast thyroid and endometrial cancer make up the four major criteria minor criteria are composed of other thyroid lesions adenoma and multinodular goiter mental retardation hamartomatous intestinal polyps fibrocystic breast disease lipomas fibromas genitourinary tumors particularly renal cell cancer genitourinary malformations and uterine fibroids which are more weakly associated with cowden's syndrome if an individual has a first degree relative with cowden's syndrome the criteria require only one of the following any single pathognomonic or major criterion two minor criteria or history of bannayan riley ruvalcaba syndrome brrs after cowden's syndrome is established clinically the actual diagnosis of phts is confirmed only by the identification of a germline mutation in pten mmac tep parents with pten mutations have been observed to have a disproportionately high number of offspring with autism spectrum disorder asd and macrocephaly but only a handful of reports have described families with cowden's syndrome and asd and those reports that have been documented with pedigrees tend to be small and incomplete in this report we describe a case of cowden's syndrome with a strong family history of multiple malignancies and an unusually high number of members with asd in a very clearly phenotyped family our patient was a year old caucasian father index case of three children was previously diagnosed with cowden's syndrome see below the patient was referred to our endocrinology department by his oncology geneticist for management of his thyroid cancer in in when his year old son was undergoing investigations for asd the father was asked to have a blood test for genetic screening because the child was too anxious the father was found to carry a c g substitution at base c c g in exon of the pten gene changing amino acid number from serine to a stop codon p s x thereafter genetic testing was carried out for all immediate members of his family except for the patient's year old father all of his living kindred three children brother and nephew were found to carry pten mutations his mother and sister had died of breast cancer at and years old respectively prior to family genetic testing before his diagnosis of cowden's syndrome the patient had undergone nasal polypectomy in and two subtotal thyroidectomies in and histology showed papillary thyroid carcinoma in view of his increased risk of thyroid cancer due to pten mutations the patient was referred to a head and neck surgeon and advised to undergo complete thyroidectomy in histology revealed micropapillary carcinoma at the time of review he was taking two tablets of calcichew d takeda uk wooburn green uk and g of levothyroxine daily which adequately suppressed his thyroid stimulating hormone tsh levels and kept his thyroglobulin at an undetectable level indicating no disease recurrence hematological and biochemical assessments showed a hemoglobin of g dl creatinine mol l calcium mmol l alanine aminotransferase iu l tsh mu l free thyroxine pmol l thyroglobulin g l and vitamin d nmol l the patient never smoked or consumed alcohol he is currently living with his wife and three children and works as a bus driver his physical examination showed evidence of macrocephaly a neck scar from a previous thyroidectomy palmoplantar keratoses and mucosal papillomas on the tongue he had no focal neurological deficits his weight was kg and his height was m body mass index kg m his blood pressure was mmhg and his heart rate was beats per minute in regular rhythm ultrasound surveillance in revealed two masses in his right kidney that were confirmed by computed tomography ct ct guided biopsy showed chromophobe type renal cell carcinoma and laparoscopic right nephrectomy was performed the patient has been regularly monitored for manifestations associated with pten mutations according to national comprehensive cancer network guidelines his palmoplantar keratoses and the mucosal papillomas on his tongue are being monitored by a dermatologist he is currently attending a polyposis clinic and is under the care of an upper gastrointestinal team for gastrointestinal surveillance colonoscopy is being performed biannually and in a recent colonoscopy two benign mm cecal polyps were excised a number of clinical manifestations arising from pten mutations have emerged among his kindred his now year old son and and year old daughters have been diagnosed with asd the patient's son brother and nephew developed thyroid nodules both the son and brother underwent total thyroidectomy nonmalignant the son also has skin lesions on his back currently being monitored by a dermatologist the patient and all members of his family with pten mutations have macrocephaly his year old maternal aunt did not undergo genetic testing his other maternal aunt died at the age of prior to our patient's diagnosis with cowden's syndrome none of the patient's maternal aunts had a history of cancer the patient his mother and his brother all completed secondary school and work as bus drivers before dying his mother had been a full time house wife and his sister had graduated from a university and worked as an accountant his nephew also completed a university degree all his children are attending a school for children with special needs table it has been recognized that parents with pten mutations have a disproportionately high number of offspring with asd but there are only a few reports on families with cowden's syndrome and asd in this report we describe a case of a patient with cowden's syndrome who has a strong family history of cancers and a variety of manifestations from pten mutations although germline pten pathogenic variants have been reported to be present in of individuals with asd little information is available on the prevalence of asd among families with cowden's syndrome the high proportion of offspring with asd in our patient's case all three children is unusually high for a single family the patient himself has exhibited progressive development of tumors with age suggesting the importance of close health monitoring for this group of patients before gene identification was available patients with cowden's syndrome were rarely diagnosed the only available estimate of population frequency is which is likely to be conservative because of its variable expression and subtle mucocutaneous lesions as exemplified by our patient who was found to carry a pten mutation only through investigation of his son for asd he therefore underwent several subtotal thyroidectomies prior to his diagnosis with cowden's syndrome a delay in diagnosis clearly has a devastating impact on at risk members of the family as demonstrated in this report his mother and sister both developed breast cancer and died of this condition members in the younger generation of his family are now closely monitored for early features of phts including thyroid ultrasound thyroid abnormality occurs in all male members with pten mutations in this family our patient and his son brother and nephew which is one of the most frequently reported manifestations of cowden's syndrome affecting between two thirds and three fourths of patients these include benign thyroid abnormalities such as multinodular goiter adenomatous nodules and follicular adenomas whereas there is a increase in lifetime risk of thyroid cancer such as follicular and papillary thyroid cancer but never medullary cancer both first degree adult female relatives mother and sister of our patient developed breast cancer a common manifestation of cowden's syndrome in women and they died of this disease at young ages and years although they did not have the opportunity to undergo genetic testing given the negative test for pten mutations in his father the young age at the time of their death and the autosomal dominant inheritance of cowden's syndrome it is likely that his mother and sister also carried pten mutations women with cowden's syndrome have a lifetime risk of developing benign breast disease of about and of breast cancer between and with an average age at diagnosis between and years men with cowden's syndrome have also been shown to have breast cancer about half of women with cowden's syndrome have been shown to develop multiple large uterine fibroids and have a lifetime risk of developing endometrial cancer between and our patient also has other manifestations of cowden's syndrome including renal cell carcinoma gastrointestinal and nasal polyps palmoplantar keratoses and mucosal papillomas which are cardinal features of cowden's syndrome the risk of other cancers is also increased among individuals with cowden's syndrome including skin and possibly brain tumors macrocephaly was found in all family members with pten mutations in the present report authors of a previous report described a year old boy with pten mutations who had progressive macromegaly asd and focal epilepsy studies using magnetic resonance imaging of the brain have shown that macrocephaly in patients with asd who carry a pten mutation is due to overgrowth of the white matter but how changes in the pten gene are related to the risk of developing asd remains to be elucidated in their study of pten mutation spectrum and genotype phenotype correlations in brrs and cowden's syndrome marsh et al showed the overlap of a number of clinical features the sharing of identical pten mutations in addition to the presence of brrs cowden's syndrome overlap families all highly suggestive that brrs and cowden's syndrome are different presentations of a single syndrome and that anticipation may also pertain in this syndrome however there has been no evidence from subsequent studies to support this notion it is of interest that our patient's family appears to have increasing severity of learning difficulty with the youngest generation as reflected by education level and high frequency of asd among offspring annual clinical examinations are recommended between and months from years old or years before the family's earliest age of cancer diagnosis examinations should focus on all clinical manifestations associated with pten mutations including skin breast thyroid endometrial gastrointestinal and renal cell cancers this would require input from specialists across different disciplines up to date management guidelines are available from the national comprehensive cancer network the strengths of this case report lie in its details of the clinical manifestations of all immediate family members and the relatively large number of offspring in a single family all of whom have asd this case is limited by the reliance on clinical history elicited from one member of the family the index case we overcame this limitation by conducting thorough research of the medical case notes and communicating with specialists in charge of the patient and his family we describe a man and his family with pten mutations who have increased risk of cancers and an unusually high number of offspring with asd early recognition and close surveillance are vital in order to provide treatment and early screening for asymptomatic at risk relatives
 genetic diagnostic evaluation of trio based whole exome sequencing among children with diagnosed or suspected autism spectrum disorder autism spectrum disorder asd is a group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorders recent tremendous advances in the whole exome sequencing wes enable rapid identification of variants associated with asd including single nucleotide variations snvs and indels to further explore genetic etiology of asd in chinese children with negative findings of copy number variants cnvs we applied wes in simplex families with a single affected offspring with asd or suspected asd and validated variations predicted to be damaging by sanger sequencing the results showed that an overall diagnostic yield of in the group of asd and in the group of suspected asd was observed in our cohort among patients with diagnosed asd developmental delay or intellectual disability dd id was the most common comorbidity with a diagnostic yield of followed by seizures and craniofacial anomalies all of identified de novo snvs and indels among patients with asd were loss of function lof variations and were slightly more frequent among female male vs female vs a total of seven presumed causative genes chd aff adnp pogz shank il rapl and pten were identified in this study in conclusion wes is an efficient diagnostic tool for diagnosed asd especially those with negative findings of cnvs and other neurological disorders in clinical practice enabling early identification of disease related genes and contributing to precision and personalized medicine keywords autism spectrum disorder whole exome sequencing diagnostic yield comorbidity genetic etiology autism spectrum disorder asd is a group of highly heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorders affecting in children aged years with boys four times more likely to be affected than girls baio et al it's characterized by impaired reciprocal social interaction and communication as well as restricted repetitive interests and behaviors the lancet the symptoms could develop gradually from early childhood affecting daily functioning and persisting throughout one's life stefanatos given the variety of phenotypes and severity it's believed that genetic factors play a key role in the pathogenesis of asd in combination with developmental environmental factors hofvander et al mattila et al anagnostou et al the clinical and genetic heterogeneity of asd has proved to be challenging to the diagnostic workup of affected patients routine testing for fragile x syndrome karyotyping and chromosomal microarray cma have been established as the first tier tests for patients with asd for several years accounting only for about and cases respectively shen et al betancur state and levitt devlin and scherer certain loci were identified to confer risk for asd and p q q and q were the most frequent marshall et al weiss et al fernandez et al hogart et al hiroi et al in addition several genes identified by copy number variants cnvs screening and target sequencing for candidate genes were related to asd susceptibility such as ptchd nrxn nlgn shank shank and so on jamain et al moessner et al kim et al noor et al sato et al dabell et al recent rapidly improved accuracy and decreased cost of whole exome sequencing wes enabled the application among proband parent trios of asd in clinical practice opening the way to the discovery of single nucleotide variations snvs and indels sanders et al o'roak et al by using wes patients with sporadic asd could be identified and this rate even reached to because of the highly inbred nature of the saudi population making it useful in complementing cma designed to detect cnvs and better characterizing the genetic architecture for asd in simplex families o'roak et al yu et al tammimies et al al mubarak et al however thus far there remains a gap in our knowledge of the diagnostic yield of trio wes among chinese children with autistic features when cma is unable to detect risk related variations and its impacts on clinical practice it is estimated that more than of individuals with asd have comorbidities including developmental and psychiatric disorders hofvander et al kohane et al based on the suspicion that genetic mechanism of children suffered an abnormality of morphogenesis differed from those who did not miles et al collected data of dysmorphisms among children with asd the patients were further divided into two subsets of patients with documented dysmorphology complex group and without evident disrupted morphogenesis essential group the findings demonstrated that an abnormal karyotype or a clinically recognized syndrome were identified and restricted to complex group triggered by this incentive we classified patients into different subgroups according to clinical manifestations to explore the utility of wes and better characterize the underlining genetic differences in an attempt to expand the genetic spectrum of asd by identifying novel snv and indels and evaluate how well wes could make up the deficiency of cma in china trio based wes was further implemented among children diagnosed as asd and suspected of having asd with negative findings of cma data were collected from children visiting the outpatient clinic of department of developmental behavioral pediatric and children healthcare at xinhua hospital shanghai china during march to december without detection of cnvs related to asd a total of unrelated children aged months to years with autistic features were enrolled to further complete trio based whole exome sequencing wes all probands did not have neurological disorders such as cerebral palsy and schizophrenia or have the known chromosome genetic disorders such as trisomy syndrome trisomy syndrome trisomy syndrome rett syndrome fragile x syndrome chromosome microarray analysis were applied by using cyto scan hd array affymetrix santa clara ca

and benign based on standards and guidelines of the american college of medical genetics and genomics acmg potential causative genetic variants have been deposited in database of lovd with associated accession numbers ranging from to the clinical characteristics of children with diagnosed asd and suspected asd were summarized in table table among the patients with asd there were children younger

targeted regions were covered by x reads with enough average depth x supplementary table s and details of qc the depth the coverage and the target regions covered by x reads were shown in figure potential causative variants were subsequently confirmed by sanger sequencing a conclusive genetic diagnosis were obtained in seven of children identified by wes corresponding to an overall diagnostic yield of in the group of asd and in the group of suspected asd we detected and validated a total of seven variants and each was identified in a different gene table table based on the distribution of the confirmed variants frameshift were the most common followed by the missense stop gained and start lost variants among the causative variants the presumed mode of inheritance was autosomal dominant in de novo and x linked in de novo and inherited de novo mutations accounted for six of seven of the overall molecular diagnoses among patients with diagnosed asd all of identified de novo snvs and indels were loss of function lof variations and were slightly more frequent among female male vs female vs in addition all of patients with diagnosed asd revealed to carry de novo lof variations were co occurring with dd id a de novo missense variation was identified in one patient with suspected asd in total seven genes chd aff adnp pogz shank il rapl and pten with presumed pathogenic variations were identified in this study the discovery of wes makes both early clinical detection and genetic counseling possible in various ways among four of seven probands with a conclusive molecular diagnosis in addition to the following up for asd based on the risk genes these patients received further workup of systemic involvement in this cohort for example developmental and behavioral evaluation were conducted in the patients with variants of aff and il rapl respectively seizures short stature abnormalities of skeleton system eye ear brain and gastrointestinal tract screening and developmental and behavioral evaluation were implemented in the patient with a de novo snv of pogz hormone deficiency short stature obesity hypotonia seizures and feeding problems screening were evaluated in the patient with a de novo snv of adnp and correspondingly medication was changed growth hormone was applied in patients with adnp and pogz based on the diagnosis of short stature brain protein hydrolysate was discontinued in patients with seizures two couples with future pregnancy were informed the importance of prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic diagnosis with the advent of decreasing cost combined with superior efficiency of wes studies focusing on the contribution of de novo and or inherited mutations become affordable as well as avoid the potential diagnostic odyssey' bamshad et al o'roak et al tan et al in this study with negative findings of asd related cnvs by using cma we further confirmed utility of trio wes for diagnosis among children with asd or suspected asd in clinical practice all de novo and inherited variants with predicted damaging effect were validated by sanger sequencing in both patients and parents genetic etiology was identified in seven of trios with an overall detection rate of within the diagnosed asd group six of patients received molecular diagnoses which was similar to the results observed among sporadic asd as well as those focusing on either de novo or inherited variations ranging from to neale et al sanders et al de rubeis et al dong et al iossifov et al tammimies et al an interesting finding emerging from this study implied the importance of completed asd related assessments in enabling a higher diagnostic yield among patients with suspected asd our data showed that compared with children with suspected asd the diagnostic yield was higher among patients with diagnosed asd moreover diagnostic rate seemed high among asd patients suffering from other neurodevelopmental disorders including dd id suggesting that patients with these comorbidities may benefit more from wes these findings were supported by the work of tammimies et al who recommended wes as a first tier test for asd especially when comorbid with physical and congenital anomalies tammimies et al to some extent the relatively higher yield might result from the patients diagnosed and managed in the outpatient those who were diagnosed as asd especially co occurring with other neurodevelopmental disorders are more likely undergone etiological testing including wes given a high suspicion of genetic etiology the past few years have witnessed increasing studies of asd trios published highlighting the role of de novo variants and improving the identification of candidate risk genes for asd o'roak et al iossifov et al given that de novo variation is less frequent and potentially more deleterious we evaluated its diagnostic rates and effects to determine risk genes among children with diagnosed asd de novo variations were observed in of the patients moreover de novo lof mutations contribute to cases with asd our findings that de novo variations of lof predominant is contrary to previous population based studies is intriguing iossifov et al o'roak et al sanders et al one possible explanation is that asd patients with other neurodevelopment disorders are prior to be tested by wes in outpatient and may limit generalizability to the broader asd population another key finding demonstrated here was that in spite of a predominant male to female ratio about de novo lof mutations were slightly more enriched in females with asd and this finding was consistent with the previous results levy et al iossifov et al genetic studies suggest that the strong male bias in liability might be attributed to a female protective effect in which a higher load of mutations were tolerated by female gilman et al levy et al an increasing body of evidence indicates that affected female with asd are more susceptible to de novo snvs and indels of lof neale et al sanders et al de rubeis et al dong et al iossifov et al jacquemont et al in addition to variations mentioned before large cnvs encompassing more genes and probably more damaging are especially abundant in affected females levy et al sanders et al jacquemont et al these findings suggest to us that other underlying factors that have not yet been identified may contributes much more in males than in females all of genes with presumed causative mutations identified here were previously reported in asd herman et al piton et al nishiyama et al bernier et al colak et al helsmoortel et al stessman et al yi et al six genes chd aff adnp pogz shank and il rapl were identified among patients with diagnosed asd with dd id piton et al nishiyama et al bernier et al colak et al helsmoortel et al stessman et al yi et al in spite of de novo lof variations detected in shank and chd patient asd and asd presented asd and dd id without other disorders at the age of testing shank was a gene encoding a scaffolding protein that is enriched in postsynaptic densities of excitatory synapses yi et al and chd allelic variants of which are associated with asd encoding the protein chromodomain helicase dna binding protein nishiyama et al which is a chromatin regulator enzyme that is essential during fetal development ronan et al at present the mechanism of the higher incidence in males remains inconclusive and hormones sex specific brain differences or variation on the sex chromosomes were speculated to play a role in we identified two variants one missense and one de novo lof in two x chromosome genes aff and il rapl aff whose function is to encode a putative transcriptional activator that is a member of the af fmr gene family was previously associated with asd and mental retardation x linked fraxe type colak et al and in patient asd with a missense mutation in aff displayed gastrointestinal disorders in addition to dd id patient asd with a de novo lof variation in il rapl showed asd co occurring with dd id seizures and craniofacial anomalies this gene is highly expressed in post natal brain structures which functions in the hippocampal memory system thus suggesting a key role in the physiological processes underlying memory and learning abilities gambino et al a de novo lof variation in pogz was identified in patient asd with dd id and short stature interestingly previous reports showed patients with variation in adnp often displayed helsmoortel van der aa syndrome helsmoortel et al however without obesity and short stature at age of diagnosis patients asd harboring a de novo lof mutation start lost in adnp presented novel phenotype of micropenis and anal stenosis after genetic counseling this patient were screened by biochemical tests related to hormone deficiency short stature and suggested to be followed up in department of pediatric endocrinology genetics there remains one gene pten with a de novo missense variation was detected in a child with suspected asd this child presented typically macrocephaly and dd id pten identified as a tumor suppressor is mutated in a large number of cancers at high frequency bonneau and longy these results implied that a continuum of neurological and non neurological disorders that present in varied patterns might result from candidate risk genes by interacting with other factors to our knowledge this work represents the first comprehensive analysis in chinese children with diagnosed and suspected asd by trio based wes similar to other studies by wes one of potential limitations is that true causative variants may be omitted as a result of stringent criteria to filter false positives besides wes has limited ability to detect genomic imbalances and could not evaluate variations located on non coding sequences notwithstanding the small sample size our study in part contributes to dataset of phenotype and genetic etiology of asd in chinese children moreover we confirmed the utility of wes in patients without positive results of cnvs improving the detection rate in a way accordingly many challenges remain it's hopeful for a brighter future of individuals with asd and their families benefiting from the advantages of wes in conclusion wes offers the advantage of early screening of the underlying asd related genes when related cnvs were not identified by cma providing genetic diagnoses across diverse clinical subgroups and contributing to precision and personalized medicine
 naa dysfunction with normal nata complex activity in a girl with non syndromic id and a de novo naa p v g variant a case report the naa naa nata protein complex is an n terminal acetyltransferase responsible for acetylating of eukaryotic proteins in recent years naa variants have been found in patients with an x linked developmental disorder called ogden syndrome in its most severe form and in other familial or de novo cases with variable degrees of syndromic intellectual disability id affecting both sexes here we report and functionally characterize a novel and de novo naa nm_ c t g p v g missense variant that was detected by trio based whole exome sequencing in an year old girl with mild moderate non syndromic intellectual disability she had delayed motor and language development but normal behavior without autistic traits her blood leukocyte x inactivation pattern was within normal range functional characterization of naa v g by cycloheximide chase experiments suggests that naa v g has a reduced stability compared to naa wt and in vitro acetylation assays revealed a reduced enzymatic activity of monomeric naa v g but not for naa v g in complex with naa nata enzymatic activity we show that naa v g has a reduced stability and monomeric catalytic activity while nata function remains unaltered this is the first example of isolated naa dysfunction in a case of id suggesting that the syndromic cases may also require a degree of compromised nata function keywords naa x linked xlid developmental delay intellectual disability n alpha acetyltransferase acetylation nata the naa naa protein complex nata is an n terminal acetyltransferase nat responsible for acetylating nt acetylating of eukaryotic proteins naa is the catalytic subunit that naa is docking to the ribosome forming a catalytically active complex the nata complex that acetylates n termini of newly synthesized peptide chains as the chain emerges from the ribosomal exit tunnel the nata complex will acetylate peptide chains with either serine alanine glycine threonine valine or cysteine as the n terminal residue after the initiator methionine has been cleaved off by methionine aminopeptidases in addition to its role in nata mediated cotranslational acetylation and propionylation monomeric naa is believed to have nata independent roles e g post translational nt acetylation of proteins with neo n termini acetylation of lysine side chains k acetylation and acetyltransferase independent roles such as protein protein interactions with for instance dna methyltransferase dnmt or p activated kinase interacting exchange factor pix naa is an essential gene in trypanosoma brucei caenorhabditis elegans and drosophila melanogaster and essential for normal development in danio rerio in the years since the human nata complex was identified and characterized both naa and naa have repeatedly been associated with different types of cancer suggesting a role in regulating cell proliferation and survival in recent years several different naa variants have been linked to rare genetic disorders in a naa c t c p s p missense variant was identified as the cause of the x linked ogden syndrome the locus for naa is xq the patients affected by ogden syndrome were all boys from two independent families in one in the other ogden syndrome is associated with severe developmental delay dd a lipodystrophic facial appearance short stature microcephaly cardiac arrhythmias and multiple malformations all of the boys died before years of age carrier females of the ogden syndrome naa variant all have skewed x inactivation patterns and have no reported phenotypes casey and colleagues described a second naa missense variant c a c p y s in two adult male patients with syndromic intellectual disability id cardiac dysfunction long qt interval and scoliosis but not ogden syndrome the variant was de novo in their mildly affected mother a female with learning problems and heart disease long qt interval and ventricular tachycardia her blood leukocyte x inactivation pattern was balanced in addition to the two missense variants described above several naa variants that also affect females have been identified esmailpour and colleagues identified a bp splice donor site deletion c t a in three brothers and an uncle with lenz micropthalmia syndrome a condition with id dysmorphic features and other malformations heterozygous carrier females may have mild manifestations another naa variant c c t p r w was identified both in a female and a male the latter being more severely affected in addition four naa missense variants c g t p v f c c t p r c c t a p f i and c t a p f l have been found in female patients with moderate severe or profound id postnatal growth failure as well as skeletal and cardiac anomalies here we describe an year old female with mild moderate non syndromic id whole exome sequencing wes revealed de novo occurrence of a previously undescribed naa missense variant c t g p v g functional testing demonstrated a decreased stability of overexpressed naa v g decreased monomeric naa v g catalytic activity while the nata catalytic activity remained unchanged the patient is a girl now years old born three weeks preterm by section due to transverse lie birth weight g there were no feeding difficulties in infancy or later motor and language development was delayed she walked without support at age years and at age years she said her first words at age years she knew the alphabet and tried to put letters together she used diapers until age years her

bruxism is a problem she prefers the company of younger children her intellectual level is judged to be comparable to mild moderate id formal iq testing has not yet been done at age years trio whole exome sequencing wes comparing child to parental dna sequences revealed a de novo naa nm_ c t g p v g variant which was further confirmed by sanger sequencing in line with other naa missense variants the v g substitution affects a highly conserved amino acid fig panels a and b naa is a amino acid protein which adapts the characteristic gnat fold common to nat catalytic subunits this fold consists of six or seven strands and four helices fig fig c c strands constitute the core of the protein these four strands together with the helix and the loop important for substrate binding are highly conserved v is located towards the end of the strand and a valine in this position is highly conserved in naa homologues as well as in several other nat catalytic subunits for which crystal structures have been solved fig fig c c data not shown pdb id k naa u w naa fty naa icv naa and lx ssnat the side chain of v is forming a hydrophobic pocket together with y m l and l it is also in close proximity to the sulphur group of acetyl coa accoa which could indicate a role for v in positioning of accoa fig fig d d a glycine in this position will not cause any steric clashes but loss of the more bulky hydrophobic side chain of valine may possibly cause structural alterations affecting protein stability or accoa binding in order to functionally assess naa v g we first expressed his mbp naa wt and his mbp naa v g in e coli purified enzymes and tested the in vitro nat activity contrary to his mbp naa wt it was difficult to obtain good protein expression of his mbp naa v g and a substantial fraction of the purified his mbp naa v g molecules eluted in the void volume of the size exclusion chromatography column fig panels a and b this indicate that parts of the protein aggregate in units larger than kda most likely due to an alteration of the protein structure or reduced protein stability enzymes that eluted at a column volume corresponding to monomeric his mbp naa v g were tested for catalytic activity and shown to have an approximately reduction in catalytic activity compared to his mbp naa wt fig fig panels c and d due to the low expression levels and protein yield of naa v g from e coli transfection and protein purification we transfected hela cells with plasmids coding for either v tagged naa wt or v tagged naa v g followed by immunoprecipitation ip of the overexpressed protein by an anti v antibody thereafter nat activity in the precipitate was measured naa and naa form a high affinity protein complex fig fig e e and as expected endogenous naa co immunoprecipitated with both overexpressed naa wt v and naa v g v the amount of naa and naa present in each sample were determined by sds page and western blotting bands from the western blot were quantified and the measured catalytic activity was correlated with the amount of naa v present in the sample i e a mixture of monomeric naa and naa in complex with naa the nata complex and separately correlated with the amount of naa present in the sample i e the amount of the nata complex only results from the ip activity experiment corresponded well with our previous finding fig fig the ability of naa v g to acetylate the acidic n termini eeei was greatly reduced fig fig panels b and c however it also revealed a second interesting feature as can be seen from the western blot in fig fig a a more naa co immunoprecipitated with naa v g v compared to naa wt v this was also reflected in our nat activity measurements where the immunoprecipitated naa v g v sample showed higher nata product formation for the nata substrate polypeptide sess compared to the immunoprecipitated naa wt v sample when correlating for the amount of total naa v present in the sample fig fig b b however when correlating for the amount of naa present in each sample the nata product formation per naa molecule and thus nata complex was approximately equal fig fig c c as monomeric naa has a fold lower nat activity towards nata substrates compared to the nata complex the contribution of monomeric naa on acetylation of sess is minimal taken together this suggest that naa v g has reduced catalytic activity in a monomeric form but not in complex with naa in order to assess protein turnover of naa wt and naa v g we expressed v tagged naa wt and naa v g in hela cells and performed cycloheximide chase experiments as can be seen from fig naa v g v has a higher turnover rate than naa wt v h after cycloheximide treatment the average amount of naa v g v was reduced by approximately while naa wt v molecules was reduced by relative to the amount of naa molecules before cycloheximide treatment although the amount of naa v g v is drastically decreased after h the level of naa v g v seems to stabilize at around most likely overexpressed naa v g v is present both in an unstable monomeric form that is rapidly degraded and in complex with naa which stabilizes the enzyme and protects it from degradation whole exome sequencing was performed on trios on genomic dna isolated from blood dna samples were prepared using the seqcap ez medexome kit roche bazel switzerland and followed by paired end nt sequencing on the illumina nextseq alignment and variant calling was performed as previously described average median coverage of the target region was x with of target region covered with at least reads data annotation and interpretation were performed using the cartagenia bench lab ngs module cartagenia leuven belgium the naa variant was verified by targeted sanger sequencing informed consent was obtained from patient index and family members multiple sequence alignments were created using clustalx and the illustration using espript conservation scores and coloring schemes for the naa model shown in fig fig b was b was made using consurf the human nata homology model was created and published previously in order to study the nm_ c t g p v g missense variant a bacterial

chemiluminescent substrate thermo scientific followed by detection imaging and quantification using chemidoc xrs connected with imagelab v bio rad in recent years the phenotypic spectrum associated with nata deficiency has greatly expanded several naa variants have been identified some mainly affecting males and some affecting both males and females here we characterize a previously undescribed naa de novo missense change p v g in an year old female with mild moderate id we show that naa v g has a reduced stability and loss of catalytic activity in monomeric form but most likely remains active and stable when bound to naa in the nata complex v is positioned towards the end of the strand with a hydrophobic side chain contributing to a hydrophobic pocket in the core of the protein substituting the more bulky hydrophobic side chain of valine with a hydrogen atom only will cause loss of any hydrophobic contacts the valine side chain took part in in addition the unique achirality of glycine makes it able to adopt different c backbone rotation angles than all other amino acids possibly increasing the flexibility in these bonds although v and the hydrophobic pockets surrounding v is not in direct contact with naa fig fig e e our results indicate that the increased flexibility and or reduced stability most likely is restored by naa binding several other naa missense variants have previously been found to affect naa protein stability naa v f naa y s naa f i and naa f l with the exception of y all of these residues are situated in one of the highly conserved strands or in the core of the protein the side chains of v and f which were altered in other patients with id form a hydrophobic pocket in close proximity to the hydrophobic pocket surrounding v it is therefore conceivable that v g cause disease through similar mechanisms as v f f l and f i variants the phenotypic spectrum of this group of patients is very broad ranging from learning problems in a mother heterozygous for y s to severe intellectual disability heart disease arrhythmias and short stature females can also have a severe phenotype as illustrated by three females with de novo v f f i and f l variants respectively in contrast female carriers of the p s p variant causing ogden syndrome appear to be normal probably because the missense variant is severe enough to skew x inactivation at an early stage of development saunier and colleagues described seven unrelated females sharing the naa r c missense change in five of them the blood leukocyte x inactivation patterns were determined it was normal balanced in three and skewed and in two the girl with skewing was the only naa r c individual without microcephaly or postnatal growth retardation x inactivation patterns were also tested in four of the female patients with naa variants affecting the same hydrophobic pocket as v all had random x inactivation patterns in line with lack of phenotype rescue by early deselection of cells expressing the naa variants our patient had an x inactivation pattern of phase unknown which is within our defined normal range of although a lot is known about naa function when in complex with naa the functions of monomeric naa remain disputed although an in vivo nat substrate for monomeric naa is yet to be found it has a strong substrate preference for acidic n termini in vitro and should be capable of catalyzing post translational nt acetylation of neo n termini monomeric naa has also been described both as a lysine acetyltransferase kat and to excerpt functions by stably interacting with other proteins although some of these reports remain somewhat controversial an early finding that naa is acting as a negative regulator of the transcription factor hif through lysine acetylation was for instance contradicted by several reports in the following years and more recently magin and colleagues showed that purified naa exhibits undetectable kat activity in their assays in depth studies of the naa s p causing ogden syndrome revealed that naa had a reduced capability to form a functional nata complex that it had a reduced monomeric nat activity and proteomic studies of primary cell lines revealed a reduced level of nt acetylation of nata substrates mainly it is likely that loss of nata function is more crucial than loss of monomeric naa function due to the thousands of cellular nata substrates our data suggest that the altered structure and reduced stability of naa v g mainly affect monomeric naa function and further that this may be a common feature for several previously described cases of pathogenic naa variants defining the exact disease mechanism in cases like ogden syndrome and other naa related disorders is challenging and it is not unlikely that it has a pleiotropic nature involving multiple substrates and signaling pathways more studies are thus needed in order to understand whether naa p v g and other pathogenic naa variants are causing disease due to loss of n terminal acetylation loss of k acetylation loss of n acetyltransferase independent functions or through dominant negative effects
 clinical phenotype of asd associated dyrk a haploinsufficiency dyrk a is a gene recurrently disrupted in of the asd population a growing number of case reports with dyrk a haploinsufficiency exhibit common phenotypic features including microcephaly intellectual disability speech delay and facial dysmorphisms phenotypic information from previously published dyrk a cases n and participants in an ongoing study at the university of washington uw n were compiled frequencies of recurrent phenotypic features in this population were compared to features observed in a large sample with idiopathic asd from the simons simplex collection n uw dyrk a cases were further characterized quantitatively and compared to a randomly subsampled set of idiopathic asd cases matched on age and gender n and to cases with an asd associated disruptive mutation to chd n contribution of familial genetic background to clinical heterogeneity was assessed by comparing head circumference iq and asd related symptoms of uw dyrk a cases to their unaffected parents dyrk a haploinsufficiency results in a common phenotypic profile including intellectual disability speech and motor difficulties microcephaly feeding difficulties and vision abnormalities eighty nine percent of dyrk a cases ascertained for asd presented with a constellation of five or more of these symptoms when compared quantitatively dyrk a cases presented with significantly lower iq and adaptive functioning compared to idiopathic cases and significantly smaller head size compared to both idiopathic and chd cases phenotypic variability in parental head circumference iq and asd related symptoms corresponded to observed variability in affected child phenotype results confirm a core clinical phenotype for dyrk a disruptions with a combination of features that is distinct from idiopathic asd cases with dyrk a mutations are also distinguishable from disruptive mutations to chd by head size measurable quantitative characterization of dyrk a haploinsufficiency illuminates clinical variability which may be in part due to familial genetic background the online version of this article s contains supplementary material which is available to authorized users keywords autism dyrk a genetic syndrome genetically defined subtype disruptive mutation clinical phenotype autism spectrum disorder asd is characterized by tremendous clinical variability and causal heterogeneity historical efforts to behaviorally subtype asd have been largely unsuccessful due to lack of meaningful treatment implications by subtype and inadequate consensus regarding clinical phenotype recent efforts have targeted the genetic causes of asd to explore biologically defined subtypes advances in genetic sequencing technology have improved our ability to identify disease causing mutations chromosomal abnormalities copy number variants cnvs and disruptive single nucleotide variants snvs including nonsense frameshift and splice site mutations have been associated with increased risk of asd most recently work relating asd risk to de novo disruptive snvs suggests these single point mutations account for approximately of asd cases these discoveries have prompted a shift in asd research instead of using extensive phenotyping prior to sequencing asd populations researchers have begun by identifying genes of interest in affected individuals and then exploring phenotype in specific gene cohorts the application of this genetics first approach to subtyping asd has successfully identified similar medical behavioral and dysmorphic features shared by individuals with disruptive variants in high confidence asd risk genes such as chd adnp scn a and dyrk a e g dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation regulated kinase a or dyrk a is a highly conserved gene in the down syndrome critical region of chromosome and appears to play a major role in brain development specifically neurogenesis neural plasticity and cellular death dyrk a haploinsufficiency was initially identified for its role in intellectual disability which is clinically defined as childhood onset of significant cognitive and adaptive impairment recurrent disruptions to dyrk a have been found in as many as of cases with asd in drosophila models truncating mutations to dyrk a drosophila ortholog termed the minibrain mnb gene result in microcephaly including intact but smaller brain structures dyrk a null mouse models displayed growth deficiencies resulting in mid gestational death mice heterozygous for dyrk a survived to adulthood but presented with reduced growth developmental delays motor and learning difficulties and atypical behaviors including anxiety a consistent clinical phenotype appears in humans reported cases to date have exhibited microcephaly and intellectual disability other features including seizures speech and motor delays feeding difficulties and distinct facial dysmorphology have been noted as well studies relying on medical record review have reported asd diagnoses in up to of cases with dyrk a mutations but many remaining cases have features consistent with asd such as stereotypies reduced eye contact and social anxiety few studies have conducted diagnostic evaluations of asd and asd related symptoms as part of a clinical phenotyping battery diagnostic rates may be as high as when asd is directly evaluated as part of the study assessment process literature on dyrk a haploinsufficiency supports its association with asd risk and suggests a complex phenotype that includes distinct dysmorphology as well as cognitive neurological and medical impairments however studies to date have only reported categorical descriptions of phenotype which note the presence or absence of a common phenotype such as asd or no asd quantitative assessments of asd related features in large cohorts and in relation to other asd cohorts have not been examined while previously published reports have noted an emerging phenotypic profile variability in clinical presentation remains measurable data on medical developmental and behavioral characteristics are needed to better understand small variations in phenotype between individuals furthermore varied clinical presentations of individuals with dyrk a mutations have yet to be examined in the context of their familial phenotypic profile as a measure of remaining genetic background this approach has been applied to other developmental disorders and to cnvs associated with asd but has yet to be applied to disruptive snvs associated with asd the aim of the proposed study was to examine a large cohort of cases with dyrk a mutations provide a summary of phenotype and compare recurrent medical and behavioral features to large idiopathic asd samples and a cohort with disruptive mutations to a different asd associated gene chd alongside dyrk a chd is one of the most recurrent genes with disruptive snvs implicated in asd and provides a comparison group ascertained in the same way as the cases with dyrk a mutations in this sample detection of phenotypic differences between these two groups could inform understanding of different biological profiles of asd and illuminate key features unique to each disrupted gene this study also explored the contribution of genetic background to phenotypic variability among individuals with disruptive dyrk a

anterior hairline retrognathic jaw and small chin dysmorphic feet including proximal placement of the first toe syndactyly of the second and third toe and unusually long and or crooked toes and protruding post rotated ears with overfolded thick helices were also commonly observed those with de novo disruptive snvs and chromosomal rearrangements did not differ in clinical features of those case studies where asd was mentioned and or evaluated of probands received an asd diagnosis among cases who received gold standard asd assessment rates increased to additionally features common to asd such as stereotypic and anxious behaviors were noted in many cases where reference to an asd diagnosis was absent this suggests rates of asd in dyrk a cohorts may be higher in reality than reported in the total sample of dyrk a cases published to date there are several reasons for the potential underestimated prevalence rate of asd among published dyrk a cases first most previously published cases relied on medical records which varied greatly in the detail provided and discussion of comprehensiveness of prior evaluations as such it is unknown whether asd was either evaluated and ruled out or not evaluated at all second it can be difficult to tease apart symptoms of asd from those of intellectual disability and speech impairments without specialized training and experience with differential diagnosis within developmental disabilities particularly in children with complex medical histories additionally establishing an asd diagnosis may not be the most pressing concern for families and perhaps providers given the array of impairments and medical conditions that often accompany children with a dyrk a mutation as dyrk a haploinsufficiency continues to be explored within asd risk these factors need to be considered when determining rates in this population in an effort to situate the dyrk a phenotype in the context of asd we found the dyrk a group pub snv uw snv and pub chr groups combined exhibited significantly higher incidence of key features compared to those with idiopathic asd intellectual disability speech delay motor difficulties vision abnormalities feeding difficulties and microcephaly frequency of these features also significantly differed between the dyrk a group and the comparison group with idiopathic asd and iq below this is consistent with prior evidence that disruptive snvs and cnvs often result in significantly more impairing comorbidities than in idiopathic asd notably when those with dyrk a mutations who were originally ascertained for an asd diagnosis were compared to the idiopathic group also ascertained for asd the profile remains the same this provides further support that the phenotype commonly exhibited in individuals with dyrk a disruptions and asd is indeed distinct from idiopathic asd the co occurrence of five or more of these phenotypic features in dyrk a cases of total sample of those ascertained for asd provides support for further exploration of dyrk a haploinsufficiency in an individual presenting with concerns of asd and this combination of phenotypic features prior publications of dyrk a mutation cases have relied on categorical data to describe clinical phenotype our exploration of a quantitative phenotype suggested that dyrk a haploinsufficiency is differentiable from idiopathic asd by measures of cognition adaptive skills and head size and distinguishable from a different asd associated gene mutation chd by head size it is possible that further phenotypic differences exist which have not been detected by current diagnostic tools given limits to the level of resolution inherent in clinical assessment markers relying on quantitative brain based measures may reveal gene specific profiles for instance recent work highlights divergent information processing systems for children with p cnvs and children with an early emerging disruptive snv considering the intellectual disability associated with dyrk a haploinsufficiency a passive noninvasive neuroimaging approach may help illuminate neuroendophenotypes that link the behavioral phenotype to the underlying neural mechanisms exploring quantitative phenotype in uw snv participants illuminated phenotypic heterogeneity among individuals while dyrk a mutations significantly impact functioning in a number of domains the severity of impairment varied among individuals family background may in part contribute to this variability while still exploratory variability in parental phenotype corresponded with variability observed in probands with dyrk a haploinsufficiency most striking were familial patterns on measures of head circumference even with the range of microcephaly probands with the smallest head sizes were related to parents with smaller head sizes compared to other parents within the uw snv group physiological characteristics are among the most highly correlated between parents and children in typically developing populations ranging from to our findings suggest that even in the presence of a de novo disruptive dyrk a mutation parental phenotype may still impact their affected child's presentation of course secondary genetic events embryonic or early developmental influences and treatment must also be considered as potential factors contributing to the variability our findings must be considered in the context of limitations of this study first information available for previously published cases varied widely while some case reports provided detailed record of psychiatric history others only included medical history which also varied in its extensiveness full assessment history was unknown for previously published cases raising questions whether phenotypic features left out of a case report were previously ruled out and confirmed absent or were not assessed these variations highlight the importance of consistency in phenotypic assessment across future dyrk a phenotype studies to ensure comprehensive and accurate phenotyping efforts second those with dyrk a mutations who participated in the same quantitative assessment battery remain small in number larger sample sizes are indeed needed to better understand the quantitative phenotype of dyrk a haploinsufficiency and potential variability between affected individuals also while comparison of dyrk a mutation cases to idiopathic asd provides important confirmation of distinct comorbidities within asd it is important to acknowledge that individuals in the idiopathic group may with future advances in our understanding of the genetics of asd no longer be identified as idiopathic the idiopathic group analyzed in this study likely represents a population with fewer syndromic features than populations with asd and other genetic events thus further studies and larger samples of other asd associated gene mutations are needed to further distinguish how the dyrk a haploinsufficiency phenotype differs from that of other disruptive gene events future studies of this population should also aim for greater specificity in phenotypic characterization in efforts to better understand dyrk a haploinsufficiency as a unique clinical profile continued study of asd associated genes including dyrk a will allow for improved understanding of asd subtypes and inform future approaches to personalized treatment dyrk a haploinsufficiency results in a clinical phenotype which includes microcephaly intellectual impairment the presence of vision and motor difficulties feeding difficulties language delays and asd risk the dyrk a profile suggests a potential subtype of asd despite a consistent profile quantitative assessment highlights heterogeneity in the severity of impairments with parental phenotype reflecting genetic background as a likely contributor to that variability among individuals
 hyperventilation athetosis in asxl deficiency bainbridge ropers syndrome the protein product of the drosophila additional sex combs like asx gene was shown to be a regulator both a suppressor and an activator of hox developmental genes mammals including humans possess asx orthologs expressed ubiquitously while the third asxl is predominantly expressed in the brain all are involved in transcriptional regulation of many genes through direct actions or epigenetically via histone modifications specific genes regulated by asxl have not been identified the clinical phenotype associated with heterozygous loss of asxl function was first described in bainbridge ropers syndrome omim and subsequently expanded through a total of patients to date key clinical features are as follows intellectual disability with profound speech impairment severe early feeding difficulty autistic behaviors failure to thrive severe muscular hypotonia and a characteristic long face with arched eyebrows downslanting palpebral fissures and poor expressivity we describe a new case with a striking phenotype namely hyperventilation induced athetosis the patient is the year old son of unrelated korean parents his birth weight was kg in the neonatal period he had episodes of apnea for which eeg did not support an epileptic cause he subsequently exhibited severe delays in all aspects of development he walked at years he is short of stature and has microcephaly head circumference third percentile hypertelorism and a hypoplastic face figure a he has severe intellectual disability and cannot understand or express any language he has no eye contact has never focused on any object and is considered blind brainstem auditory evoked potentials obtained recently were normal he does not have feeding or swallowing difficulties current examination reveals scoliosis and postural instability he has an ataxic wide based and staggering gait which has been gradually deteriorating he is not presently hypotonic and motor strength and sensory functions appear to be normal as are his deep tendon and plantar reflexes brain mri and several eegs have been normal since age the patient has been exhibiting frequent daily episodes of deep and constant hyperventilation his neurodevelopmental presentation places him at the severe end of the autism spectrum the hyperventilation escalates with any nervousness and as it builds he develops athetotic movements of both upper extremities especially of the hands videos and at neurology org ng the young man also hyperventilates in bed prior to falling asleep again developing the athetoid movements video both hyperventilation and movements cease with sleep written informed consent was obtained from the family for participation in the study and showing the video recordings whole exome sequencing was performed on the patient's dna using the agilent sureselect human all exon v target enrichment kit followed by sequencing on illumina hiseq bases were called using bcl fastq v and reads mapped to the hg reference sequence using the burrows wheeler aligner backtrack algorithm v a previously unreported heterozygous substitution deletion mutation in the asxl gene was identified nm_ exon c _ delinsa p s rfs resulting in frameshift and predicted premature truncation sanger sequencing confirmed the mutation in the patient figure b and its absence in his parents specific loci for which transcription is regulated by the asxl are not known nor which of these target genes underlie the resultant neurodevelopmental outcome one study in patient fibroblasts identified misregulated genes approximately half up and the rest downregulated most of which had known functions in development and proliferation or were themselves transcriptional regulators suggesting that asxl may function in upstream modulation of neurodevelopmental regulator genes asxl is clearly critical to brain development and profound developmental disturbance manifested in patients resulting from the loss of of the copies of the gene suggests haploinsufficiency as the likely mechanism athetosis with hyperventilation is seen in the present case however only hyperventilation was previously reported in cases hyperventilation in the context of severe neurodevelopmental disturbance is seen in several neurogenetic disorders including rett joubert pitt hopkins and pallister killian syndromes recent work in rett syndrome mice revealed that expression of mecp broadly in the medulla rather than in any particular medullary nucleus or pathway is required for normal breathing similar future work in autopsy and animal models of the other above diseases and in bainbridge ropers disease will gradually uncover the pathways systems and functions involved in the neurodevelopmental symptoms in affected patients and aid in the understanding of normal brain development and function our particular case suggests a neural connection in the context of asxl deficiency between pathways of respiration and of motor control
 myt l mutations cause intellectual disability and variable obesity by dysregulating gene expression and development of the neuroendocrine hypothalamus deletions at chromosome p are associated with a syndrome consisting of intellectual disability and obesity the smallest region of overlap for deletions at p contains pxdn and myt l myt l is expressed only within the brain in humans we hypothesized that single nucleotide variants snvs in myt l would cause a phenotype resembling deletion at p to examine this we sought myt l snvs in exome sequencing data from parent child trios further variants were identified through a genematcher facilitated collaboration we report patients with myt l snvs loss of function and missense the phenotype of snv carriers overlapped with that of p deletion carriers to identify the transcriptomic consequences of myt l loss of function we used crispr cas to create a knockout cell line gene ontology analysis in knockout cells demonstrated altered expression of genes that regulate gene expression and that are localized to the nucleus these differentially expressed genes were enriched for omim disease ontology terms mental retardation to study the developmental effects of myt l loss of function we created a zebrafish knockdown using morpholinos knockdown zebrafish manifested loss of oxytocin expression in the preoptic neuroendocrine area this study demonstrates that myt l variants are associated with syndromic obesity in humans the mechanism is related to dysregulated expression of neurodevelopmental genes and altered development of the neuroendocrine hypothalamus intellectual disability is defined by having an intelligence quotient of less than points and it affects about people in every obesity is defined as having a body mass index of over in adults or over the th centile in children both of these conditions are major public health concerns in western countries genetic studies have shown that small missing pieces of chromosome deletions which remove many genes and changes to the lettering of genes which stop the gene from working mutations can cause intellectual disability or obesity here we identified children with intellectual disability and obesity who have mutations in a gene called myt l this gene is thought to give an important instruction for brain development to find out what the effect of loss of myt l is on brain development we reduced the levels of myt l using a special chemical in an experimental zebrafish this showed that loss of myt l in zebrafish causes a problem with the development of the hypothalamus which may explain how myt l mutations cause obesity in humans in the zebrafish there was also reduction of a brain hormone called oxytocin which is involved in thought processes which may explain why myt l mutations cause intellectual disability we have identified a new genetic condition caused by myt l mutations further study of this gene will help us understand and treat intellectual disability and obesity intellectual disability id is defined by having a full scale intelligence quota iq of under causing difficulties with day to day functioning id affects of people and is a significant public health concern as it is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality obesity is defined as a body mass index bmi of over in adults or greater than the th centile in children cdc definition obesity affects around of adults in the united states of america and of europeans obesity is associated with cardiovascular disease and certain cancers copy number variants cnvs and single nucleotide variants snvs are a well recognized cause of id of individuals with id will have a pathogenic cnv exome sequencing can detect pathogenic snvs in around of people with id without a cnv pathogenic cnvs and snvs are also found in obesity usually in association with a syndromic presentation for example both cnvs and snvs of sim are associated with obesity in humans in sim deletion heterozygous mice there is impaired development of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus with reduced melanocortin receptor and oxytocin expression in association with hyperphagic obesity deletions at p are associated with a syndrome consisting of id and obesity the smallest region of overlap contains the pxdn and myelin transcription factor like myt l genes bi allelic snvs in pxdn are associated with congenital cataracts no cnvs containing only pxdn have been reported in decipher in association with id thus pxdn is not a strong candidate gene for the phenotype associated with p deletions snvs in myt l have been reported in children with id myt l is a member of the myelin transcription factor family which is defined by the presence of a unique cystein cystein histidine cystein zinc finger domain myt l is a pro neuronal transcription factor and in combination with other transcription factors can re program fibroblasts into neurons in vitro studies indicate that myt l functions as a transcriptional repressor the role of myt l in brain development is not well understood however myelin transcription factor myt has been shown to repress transcription in neuronal progenitor cells hence blocking notch signaling and promoting neuronal differentiation based upon its biological function myt l is a strong candidate gene for id within certain deletion regions there are single genes in which snvs recapitulate the deletion phenotype for example we recently demonstrated that p deletions and snvs in sox present with coffin siris syndrome here we utilized exome sequencing data from parent child trios in the deciphering developmental disorders ddd study to demonstrate that snvs in myt l are associated with a phenotype resembling that of p deletions with id and obesity through gene expression profiling of an myt l null cell line we show that myt l regulates a network of transcription factors involved in neurodevelopmental disorders knockdown of myt l orthologues in zebrafish resulted in altered hypothalamic oxytocin expression providing a potential mechanism for the obesity phenotype in humans we identified individuals with heterozygous de novo myt l variants through trio exome sequencing performed as part of the deciphering developmental disorders study and an additional individuals with heterozygous de novo myt l variants through a

variant c g a p gly arg protein truncating variants ptv in developmentally crucial genes should occur less frequently than predicted in individuals without developmental disorders the expected frequency of ptv in human genes has been reported in the exac database based upon parameters such as mutation rates for given nucleotide bases we identified only a single loss of function variant in myt l in the exac database accessed march this is compared to an expected number of loss of function variants giving a probability of loss of function intolerance score of a probability of loss of function intolerance score indicates intolerance to loss of function in addition missense variants were reported compared to an expected missense variants z score indicating constraint on variation the provean median interquartile range vs interquartile range mann whitney u test u z p and sift median interquartile range vs interquartile range mann whitney u test u z p scores for the missense variants in our patients were significantly higher than the scores for exac missense variants fig a this indicates substantial constraint on both ptv and missense variants this supports a pathogenic role for ptv and missense variants in the reported phenotype in addition an in silico model of the structural effects of the myt l missense variants indicated that they were likely to interfere with dna binding fig b to examine the hypothesis that haploinsufficiency for myt l drives the p deletion syndrome we compared the phenotype of p deletion carriers with those of myt l single nucleotide variant snv carriers the phenotypes associated with deletion of p were defined by a literature review and and we report an unpublished case patient in table the smallest region of overlap contains pxdn and myt l no pxdn snvs were identified in the ddd exome dataset using fischer's exact test there was no significant difference between the proportions of deletion or snv patients with the following phenotypes intellectual disability gross motor delay speech delay autism overweight obese or hyperphagia this supports our hypothesis that myt l haploinsufficiency is central to the p deletion phenotype given the phenotype of intellectual disability and predisposition to overweight obesity we reasoned that myt l should be expressed in relevant neuroanatomical structures we first confirmed that myt l expression is confined to the brain and pituitary in humans using the gtex portal accessed march we then utilized the allen brain atlas to examine the spatial expression pattern of myt l in human brain in keeping with a role in cognition intellectual disability myt l is expressed at significantly higher levels in the adult cerebral cortex than in the hippocampus basal ganglia and hypothalamus mann whitney u test p fig a we could not demonstrate significant expression of myt l in hypothalamic structures relevant to appetite and obesity in the adult brain we then hypothesized that myt l might be expressed in hypothalamic structures relevant to appetite and obesity during brain development data from the prenatal lmd microarray from the brainspan atlas of the developing human brain demonstrated that myt l was expressed in multiple hypothalamic structures at post conception weeks pcw with significant reduction in expression at pcw mann whitney u test p fig b this suggests that myt l principally plays a role in hypothalamic development rather than postnatal hypothalamic function to study the transcriptional consequence of loss of myt l function we created a human embryonic kidney hek null cell line using crispr cas sanger sequencing of genomic dna confirmed creation of homozygous premature stop codons in myt l gene expression profiling using the clariom s array identified differentially expressed genes fold expression change false discovery rate enrichment analysis using enrichr http amp pharm mssm edu enrichr demonstrated that the differentially expressed gene set was enriched for the gene ontology biological process term gene expression go adjusted p value z score combined score fig a and gene ontology cellular component terms nucleolus go adjusted p value z score combined score and nucleoplasm go adjusted p value z score combined score fig b the gene set was also enriched for the reactome pathways gene expression_homo sapiens_r has adjusted p value x z score combined score and generic transcription pathway_homo sapiens_r has adjusted p value z score combined score fig c the differentially expressed genes were also enriched for genes from the omim disease ontology term mental retardation p value adjusted p value z score combined score fig d this suggests that myt l regulates a network of genes that control transcription and which have themselves been implicated in the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders given the obesity phenotype in patients with myt l snvs we hypothesized that loss of myt l function may interfere with development of the neuroendocrine hypothalamus we sought to explore this by creating a zebrafish knockdown model myt l has two orthologs in zebrafish myt la and myt lb by using whole mount in situ hybridization wish we demonstrate that both orthologs are expressed diffusely within the zebrafish central nervous system including the hypothalamus and not within any extra neuronal tissues fig a this resembles the expression pattern in humans anrt encodes a dimerization partner required for sim function in hypothalamic development to examine the role of sim arnt in regulating myt la mytl b we performed wish for myt la in the previously described homozygous arnt hi tg null zebrafish in the mutant zebrafish myt la was undetectable in the hypothalamus fig b this shows a role for sim arnt dimers in regulating myt la expression in the hypothalamus these experiments demonstrate that myt l lies downstream of sim arnt in the leptin melanocortin sim pathway and in turn myt l regulates oxt expression in the hypothalamus antisense morpholinos mo targeting myt la or myt lb alone or in combination were injected into zebrafish embryos at the or cell stage the amount of mo injected was kept constant wish using probes against oxytocin oxt or arginine vasopression avp was performed mo targeting myt la or myt lb resulted in an almost complete loss of oxt in the neuroendocrine pre optic area fig c and d mo targeting myt la or myt lb also resulted in an almost complete loss of avp in the neuroendocrine pre optic area but not in the ventral hypothalamus fig e and f this suggests that myt la and myt lb may play a specific role in regulating the development of the neuroendocrine hypothalamus here we describe individuals with de novo snvs in myt l these individuals shared several phenotypic features all had global developmental delay or intellectual disability gross motor delay was present in all and patient had not walked independently by the age of years old patient also required a wheelchair but this was related to spastic paraparesis secondary to spina bifida no other individuals with cnvs or snvs of myt l have been reported with a neural tube defect the spina bifida in patient is likely etiologically unrelated to the myt l snv six of the myt l snv carriers were overweight or obese based upon bmi centiles and patient requires a dress size implying obesity five of the patients had hyperphagia but patient did not have sufficient speech development or motor function to ask for or take food three had a diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder there was no shared distinctive facial dysmorphology two myt l snv carriers have been reported by de rocker et al patient had developmental delay autism and was described as obese bmi not reported patient had developmental delay autism and bmi th centile an autistic male with developmental delay and febrile seizures in association with an myt l nonsense mutation was reported by wang et al however bmi was not described in this paper there was no significant difference in the frequency of phenotypic features between p deletion and myt l snv carriers this suggests that haploinsufficiency for mty l drives the p deletion phenotype our report confirms that cnvs and snvs of myt l are associated with a syndromic presentation consisting of developmental delay id hyperphagia and obesity the clinical presentation of myt l cnv and snv carriers overlaps with other mendelian causes of obesity prader willi syndrome pws is a well recognized cause of hyperphagic obesity the presence of characteristic dysmorphology and hypogenitalism may help differentiate pws from myt l snv cnv carriers deletions and snvs of sim are associated with hyperphagic obesity with developmental delay associated with q deletions bi allelic snvs of leptin lep leptin receptor lepr and pro opiomelanocortin pomc are also associated with hyperphagic obesity lep and lepr can be distinguished from myt l due to the association of hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with lep and lepr snvs patients with pomc deficiency present with a range of endocrine problems not reported in association with myt l variants there is also phenotypic overlap between certain microdeletion syndromes and myt l smith magenis syndrome p deletion is associated with developmental delay and variable obesity facial dysmorphology sleep disturbance and self injurious behavior reported in smith magenis syndrome were not identified in our myt l cohort q deletion carriers have increased rates of obesity and the presence of cleft lip palate congenital heart disease or parathyroid disease can permit distinction from myt l variant carriers our data supports the hypothesis that myt l snvs cause loss of protein function and haploinsufficiency data from the exac indicated a loss of function intolerance score of one which indicates that myt l is a haploinsufficient gene that will not tolerate heterozygous loss of function variants four of the snvs we report were predicted to be ptv which would result in loss of protein function in silico modelling indicates that the missense variants we report would be predicted to interfere with the binding of myt l to dna both p his tyr and p arg gln affect conserved amino acids that directly bind to dna these variants are likely to disrupt dna binding the p leu pro variant lies at a protein loop which is crucial for the correct folding of the second zinc finger domain this missense variant is likely to disrupt protein structure and hence dna binding his and gly are zinc ligands and any change will disrupt protein structure the fact that the phenotypes of p deletions and myt l snvs overlap supports haploinsufficient loss of function of myt l as the disease mechanism by gep in an myt l hek cell line with homozygous myt l frameshift variants we demonstrate altered expression of multiple genes implicated in regulation of gene expression and transcription haploinsufficiency for myt l has clear potential to disrupt expression of critical genes during brain development and hence cause a neurodevelopmental disorder the expression pattern of myt l in the human brain reflects the clinical features of individuals with p deletions and myt l snvs the widespread expression of myt l in brain structures relevant to cognition supports a role for loss of function in the etiology of id this is in keeping with the fact that the overwhelming majority of id and autism genes have widespread expression in the cerebral cortex the expression pattern of myt l in human brain also supports a role for the gene in appetite obesity myt l was expressed in multiple hypothalamic nuclei at pcw with significant reduction in expression at pcw this leads us to hypothesise that myt l may play a role in the development of the hypothalamus and that myt l loss of function may be associated with obesity by impairing development of hypothalamic nuclei similar mechanisms operate for other obesity genes such as sim to investigate a role for myt la b in development of the neuroendocrine hypothalamus we generated a knockdown model in zebrafish injection of mo against myt la or myt lb alone or in combination resulted in a severe loss of expression of oxt in the neuroendocrine preoptic area knockdown of myt la b resulted in loss of avp expression in the neuroendocrine preoptic area but not the ventral hypothalamus this suggests that myt la b may influence the development of the neuroendocrine preoptic area but not other regions of the hypothalamus the neuroendocrine preoptic area is the functional equivalent of the paraventricular nucleus in humans lesions of which cause hyperphagic obesity thus myt l cnvs and snvs may lead to hyperphagic obesity by impairing hypothalamic development sim functioning with its dimerization partner arnt regulates the development of the paraventricular nucleus sim deletion heterozygous mice have hypocellularity of the paraventricular nucleus and hyperphagic obesity to examine an interaction of sim with myt l we performed wish for myt la in the homozygous arnt hi tgnull zebrafish which has no functional arnt and hence disruption of sim a b function the absence of myt la expression in the neuroendocrine preoptic area demonstrates that myt l lies downstream of sim arnt in hypothalamic development our experiments also indicate that oxt is downstream of myt l this suggests that loss of oxt may be a final common pathway in genetic forms of obesity and represent a treatment target in multiple disorders in summary we have identified a series of individuals with myt l de novo snvs who present with a syndrome of id and obesity genes involved in nucleosome remodeling especially those of the neuron specific brg hbrm associated factor nbaf complex have emerged as being central to the pathogenesis of id however myt l is not known to play a role in nucleosome remodeling and gep did not demonstrate that genetic pathways involved in nucleosome remodeling are dysregulated in myt l knockdown cells this suggests that the id observed in patients with myt l snvs and cnvs is not related to altered nucleosome remodeling the mechanism by which myt l loss of function results in id is unclear murine studies of myt demonstrate that it promotes neuronal differentiation of neuronal progenitor cells by inhibiting notch signaling it seems reasonable to suggest that myt l may perform a similar function in the developing brain and that loss of myt l function will disrupt this process the obesity phenotype with myt l loss of function is associated with disrupted development of the neuroendocrine hypothalamus in zebrafish manifested by loss of oxt this is similar to the effects of sim and pou f loss of function both of which are associated with hyperphagic obesity oxt is emerging as a key neurochemical in both autism and obesity pathogenesis polymorphisms in oxt and its receptor are associated with autism risk and intranasal oxt improves autism symptoms and imaging abnormalities oxt treatment reduces food intake in humans and in sim mutant mice in conclusion we identify myt lmutations as a cause of syndromic obesity and establish myt l as a member of the leptin melanocortin sim pathway with downstream loss of oxt associated with myt l mutations a potential therapeutic target
 novel compound heterozygous asxl mutation causing bainbridge ropers like syndrome and primary igf deficiency de novo truncating and splicing mutations in the additional sex combs like asxl gene have been implicated in the development of bainbridge ropers syndrome brps characterised by severe developmental delay feeding problems short stature and characteristic facial features we describe for the first time a patient with severe short stature learning difficulties feeding difficulties and dysmorphic features with a novel compound heterozygous mutation in asxl additionally the patient also has primary insulin like growth factor igf deficiency the mutations occur in exon and proximal part of exon and are strongly conserved at the protein level across various species in silico analyses using polyphen and sift predict the amino acid substitutions to be potentially deleterious to the protein function detailed bioinformatics analysis show that the molecular defects caused by the two compound heterozygous mutations synergistically impact on two points of the molecular interaction network of asxl we hypothesise that asxl potentially has a role in transcriptional activation of igf involved in signalling pathways that regulate cell proliferation and growth which could be contributing to short stature encountered in these patients keywords asxl bainbridge ropers syndrome igf deficiency the use of next generation sequencing in children with undiagnosed or unidentified syndromic disorders is becoming more popular in recent years increasing the diagnostic ability and discovery of novel genes and mutations contributing to novel clinical phenotypes bainbridge ropers syndrome brps omim was described for the first time by bainbridge and his colleagues in the year brps is caused by de novo truncating mutations in the additional sex combs like asxl gene giving rise to characteristic phenotypic features such as short stature severe intellectual deficit feeding difficulties failure to thrive and cranio facial features brps has been reported in patients in the literature so far the majority of the patients had frameshift or truncating mutations in asxl one patient has been reported to have a splicing mutation in asxl resulting in brps bohring opitz syndrome bos omim is a developmental syndrome characterised by a severe intellectual deficit distinct posture and cranio facial abnormalities feeding problems and failure to thrive bos is caused by de novo truncating mutations in asxl which belongs to the same family as asxl bos and brps have been found to have some overlap of their clinical phenotypes we describe for the first time a patient with severe short stature secondary to igf insulin growth factor deficiency developmental delay intellectual deficit cranio facial abnormalities due to a novel compound heterozygous mutation in asxl identified by whole exome sequencing the patient is a year old caucasian british boy born at full term following an induction of labour to non consanguineous caucasian healthy british parents the antenatal scans were normal and the birth weight was kg sds he was admitted to the neonatal unit due to respiratory distress whilst in the neonatal unit he had persistent feeding difficulties and required tube feeding he was noted to have scaphocephaly that required surgical fixation at months of age he also developed severe constipation from weeks of age requiring daily bowel washouts from months of age and colostomy at years he had bilateral undescended testes requiring orchidopexy he has global developmental delay and complex learning difficulties requiring additional support at school he also has been diagnosed with autism at years of age he was referred to endocrinology for assessment of his severe short stature sds for height mid parental height sds weight sds he has dysmorphic features including prominent long nasal bridge and forehead small lower jaw thin lips low set cupped ears strabismus and down

acids urine organic acids pyruvic acid analysis were within the normal limits cgh microarray did not reveal any copy number changes targeted sequencing of igf igf r and ghr did not reveal any mutations currently the patient continues to require rigf therapy to support growth the weight gain continues to be suboptimal fig fig b b this study was given favourable ethical opinion by the north west liverpool central research ethics committee rec reference nw and site study approval was granted by the clinical research business unit at alder hey children's nhs foundation trust liverpool uk informed and written consent was obtained from the parents dna was extracted from blood samples of the child and both the biological parents trio exons were captured using sureselect xt human all exon

sequencing fig fig the mutations occur in exon and proximal part of exon fig fig multiple sequence alignment visualisation using the ucsc genome browser showed that both mutated positions are strongly conserved at the protein level across vertebrates as diverse as lemur bat fish and frog implying that mutation could potentially affect the protein structure or function in silico analyses using polyphen and sift predict the amino acid substitutions to be potentially deleterious to the protein function loss of function mutations in asxl in the form of de novo truncating dominant mutations and splicing mutation have been implicated in brps here we report for the first time a compound heterozygous asxl mutation in a patient with brps like features and associated with primary igf deficiency pathogenic mutations in asxl have been reported to occur predominantly in exon and proximal part of exon all the described mutations retain the asxn and asxh domains the compound heterozygous mutations in our patient also lie on exon and proximal exon retaining the asxn and asxh domains similar to previously described mutations fig fig both these mutations occur on the conserved asxm domain in asxl fig fig both the variants are extremely rare and have a population frequency as indicated from the exac browser the synergistic effect of both of these rare mutations potentially contributes to the loss of function of the protein contributing to the brps like phenotype our patient has multiple dysmorphic features that overlap with those described in previous reported cases of brps such as short stature failure to thrive feeding difficulties cranio facial features developmental delay and learning difficulties table table asxl belongs to the gene family of asxl genes the mammalian homologues of drosophila asx asxl includes three orthologues asxl asxl and asxl that encode the putative polycomb group pcg protein that has a role in regulating the homeotic genes hox pcg proteins can act either as transcriptional repressors or activators of hox genes the genes in the asxl family share a common domain architecture consisting of asxn asxh asxm asxm domains and a phd finger and act by forming complexes with other proteins via methylation of histones asxl has been implicated in the deubiquitination of histone h a lysine h ak ub a component of the polycomb repressive deubiquitination pr dub complex the formation of pr dub complex is critical for normal function asxl interacts with bap a ubiquitin terminal hydroxylase and removes the mono ubiquitin ub from the h ak ub patients with brps have been found to have a significant increase in the h ak ub in their fibroblasts because of the impaired deubiquitination asxl has a similar expression pattern in human tissues as asxl but at a relatively lesser levels which may explain the overlap of some phenotypic features seen in brps and bos within the human brain asxl expression has been found within the white matter insula cingulate gyrus and amygdala the spinal cord kidney bone marrow and liver also express asxl but at a lower level when compared to asxl detailed bioinformatics analysis suggests a possible molecular mechanism by which the first of the mutations r g would lead to a functional defect a scan against the elm eukaryotic linear motif database shows a stretch of amino acid residues from the position to within the wild type asxl that matches with an interaction motif lig_ _canor_ accession elme that describes canonical phosphopeptide binding motif of group of proteins proteins are important cell regulators best known for their role in cell cycle control the mutated arginine at position together with a phosphorylated serine residue residues downstream are the main determinants of interaction with proteins these proteins are also characterised as histone modification readers this links suggestively to the recently determined role of asxl in histone deubiquitination according to this hypothesis mutation of r to glycine would prevent the interaction of asxl with an as yet unidentified protein thereby damaging function through impairing its ability to scaffold epigenetic protein complexes although the molecular mechanism of the second mutation k n is unclear it is possible that this mutation affects phosphorylation of asxl through its location within recognition motifs for kinases pikk group motif from to or gsk motif from to the molecular defects caused by the two mutations would specify the disorder additively or synergistically by simultaneously impacting on two points of the molecular interaction network of asxl contributing to its loss of function the association of primary igf deficiency in brps has not been described before igf is a amino acid peptide hormone and growth factor that is structurally homologous to proinsulin in normal individuals igf circulates as part of a ternary complex with a molecular weight of kda the complex consists of igf an acid labile subunit als and a protein that binds igf igfbp primary igf deficiency is defined as basal igf and height of sds with normal or elevated levels of gh the primary action of igf is mediated by binding to its specific receptor the insulin like growth factor receptor igf r which is present in many tissues igf r is a receptor tyrosine kinase and binding of igf to igf r initiates intracellular signalling igf is one of the most potent natural activators of the akt signalling pathway which stimulates cellular growth and proliferation transcriptome analysis of asxl fibroblasts from patients with brps examining the differentially expressed genes degs has shown that the genes regulating the cellular proliferation are downregulated igf plays a vital role in activating the akt signalling pathway a potent stimulator for cell proliferation and growth we therefore hypothesise that asxl potentially has a role in transcriptional activation of igf involved in this pathway potentially via epigenetic mechanisms which could be contributing to short stature encountered in these patients the compound heterozygous mutations potentially contribute to the loss of function in asxl causing a phenotype similar to brps although with our current knowledge the molecular interaction between asxl and igf is unclear it may important to look for igf deficiency in the patients with asxl mutation
 the landscape of genetic diseases in saudi arabia based on the first diagnostic panels and exomes in this study we report the experience of the only reference clinical next generation sequencing lab in saudi arabia with the first families who span a wide range of suspected mendelian phenotypes a total of tests were performed in the period of march december comprising solo index only duo parents or affected siblings only and trio index and parents multigene panels accounted for tests while whole exome sequencing wes represented the remaining tests pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants that explain the clinical indications were identified in in panels and in exomes spanning genes and including novel variants while recessive mutations dominated the landscape of solved cases of mutations and of which are homozygous a substantial minority were solved on the basis of dominant mutations the highly consanguineous nature of the study population also facilitated homozygosity for many

are unsolved due to interpretation rather than technical limitations the online version of this article doi s contains supplementary material which is available to authorized users next generation sequencing ngs has ushered in a new era in the delivery of genomic medicine where the genetic diagnosis is no longer limited by the a priori knowledge of the caring physician bamshad et al the capacity to screen all or a large subset of genes based on broad clinical categories e g developmental delay rather than a nuanced clinical phenotype e g malpuech syndrome has also greatly expanded our knowledge of the relationship between known or putative disease genes and the resulting phenotype yang et al indeed reverse phenotyping is now commonplace in the era of clinical genomics alkuraya the ultimate benefit of improving patient care in terms of precise diagnosis management and treatment has propelled ngs based assays to the forefront of modern molecular diagnostics much has been learned from large scale ngs studies in the diagnostic setting they revealed a higher diagnostic yield usually around across clinical indications compared to standard approaches expanded the genetic and allelic heterogeneity of many conditions and challenged the concept of atypical presentations as instances of dual or sometimes triple molecular diagnoses in some patients posey et al trujillano et al however very few studies focused on highly consanguineous populations which are known to differ from outbred populations in a number of ways that impact the landscape of disease causing mutations alfares et al yavarna et al for example we have previously shown that the highly consanguineous nature of the saudi population is biased in the occurrence of recessive typically homozygous mutations in diseases that are typically caused by de novo dominant mutations e g severe intellectual disability anazi et al these characteristics are predicted to increase the sensitivity of next generation sequencing based tests which has indeed been observed in a few studies alfares et al yavarna et al in march we launched the first reference lab for ngs based assays in saudi arabia the tests offered include previously validated multigene panels as well as standard whole exome sequencing wes group the high demand for these tests by clinicians from various medical and surgical specialties across the country represented a unique opportunity to observe the distribution of disease causing mutations in the saudi population this is the largest study to date on the mutational spectrum of genetic diseases in the saudi population in the diagnostic setting the unselected nature of tested families and their representation of all regions of the kingdom allowed us to infer important patterns of genetic diseases in our highly consanguineous population that are relevant to the wider community of diagnostic ngs labs around the world all patients underwent testing on a clinical basis with the specific test panel vs exome chosen by their treating physician a standard informed consent was signed by all patients or their guardians to explain the nature of the test and its potential to reveal secondary findings with the option to decline receiving such findings phenotypes were collected as entered by the ordering physician on the requisition forms for solo tests only the index was sequenced while parents were also included in trio tests couples who presented with a history of prior affected children were offered duo tests if none of the affected children were available for testing duo testing was also rarely requested on two affected siblings seven clinically themed multigene panels were offered neuro dysmorphology skeletal dysplasia renal inborn errors of metabolism vision primary immunodeficiency and gastrointestinal the gene content and validation of these panels were previously described group wes was performed using an agilent sureselect all exons v mb capture kit agilent technologies santa clara ca usa for library preparation briefly dna was sheared mechanically after which targeted fragments were captured by probe hybridization and amplified before sequencing an illumina hiseq illumina inc san diego ca usa was used for paired end nt sequencing sequence alignment indexing of the reference genome hg variant calling and annotation used a pipeline based on bwa samtools gatk https software broadinstitute org gatk and annovar respectively essentially variants were annotated using a combination of public knowledge databases available from the annovar package and in house databases which included collections of previously published saudi disease causing variants autozygome definition solely from whole exome sequence data was undertaken as previously described carr et al our previously described in house variant interpretation pipeline was used group briefly each variant was annotated based on tracks that include chromosomal location zygosity number of reads for the reference and alternate alleles quality metrics presence within autozygome local and global frequency data in silico prediction and previous association with diseases based on hgmd and clinvar harrison et al stenson et al our reporting strategy was as follows we first considered previously reported disease causing variants and evaluated them for relevance to the patient's phenotype if such variants were identified we independently evaluated them for likely pathogenicity using local and global population frequency data as well as in silico prediction of pathogenicity if our evaluation of the variant is in agreement with the previously reported pathogenicity we reported them as the likely causal variants if none was identified we searched for other relevant variants again such novel variants were evaluated for pathogenicity in the case of apparently loss of function variants with compatible population frequency with the disease in question we reported these as likely causal however in the case of missense and in frame indels the burden of proof is much higher according to the acmg guidelines so these were usually reported as variants of unknown significance vous and the result was considered ambiguous richards et al when only one heterozygous candidate variant was identified in a relevant known recessive disease gene in the absence of a more compelling candidate we also opted to report this finding as an ambiguous result when no candidate variants were identified in known disease genes we considered variants in genes not previously linked to human disease only when biological relevance was suspected based on a number of factors pathway known to be implicated relevant animal models or at least relevant expression data results involving novel candidate genes were also considered ambiguous only results involving pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in known disease genes that explain the phenotype in the correct zygosity were labeled positive patients who opted to receive secondary information virtually all only received pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in the acmg list of genes recommended for reporting kalia et al after sanger validation of the first variants we identified a quality metric above which snvs had a probability of being a true positive all subsequent candidate variants other than indels above this value were reported without sanger validation and with a disclaimer explaining the above all candidate indels were sanger validated before reporting regardless of their quality value we report in this study the results of the first families all indigenous arabs originally from arabia referred for testing by our diagnostic laboratory table s one of the seven offered panels was requested in families solo trio and duo while wes was requested in the remaining families solo trio and duo had wes after receiving negative panel results i e reflex wes table s a positive result was reported in of those tested with panels and with wes a breakdown of the diagnostic yield by indication shows marked variability with the highest yield being multiple congenital malformations in the prenatal setting where the yield was followed by skeletal dysplasia where the yield was table s similarly duo testing of couples who lost children with a likely genetic diagnosis was associated with a high yield of if novel candidate genes are counted one notable example is a couple with a history of recurrent non immune hydrops one child who died of epidermolysis bullosa and another of osteogenesis imperfecta shared carrier status for heterozygous variants in thsd itgb and p h respectively was considered relevant table s although we always recommended wes when the panel result was negative or ambiguous reflex wes only accounted for of the wes samples autosomal recessive pathogenic and likely pathogenic mutations accounted for the majority of positive cases and were almost always homozygous this is consistent with the high rate of consanguinity in this cohort among the families for whom information on consanguinity was provided reported consanguinity in addition seven families reported endogamy i e intratribal marriage but no recognizable consanguinity otherwise dominant presumptive de novo being the rule mutations accounted for of positive cases followed by x linked mutations in total pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants spanning known disease genes were identified of these are reported here for the first time table s of the recessive positive cases were due to founder mutations defined as those encountered in other patients or present in the heterozygous state at least once in our in house database of saudi variants which is based on saudi individuals whereas were private the frequency of identified pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations ranged from the most common variant c orf nm_ exon c a g p m representing of all positive cases to the exceedingly rare e g traf ip nm_ exon c g c p w s which represents only the second mutation in traf ip in the context of severe eczema maddirevula et al in press table s we also observed several instances of biallelic pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in strictly dominant disease genes in the setting of normal parents e g itpr table dual molecular diagnosis was rare and only accounted for of exome sequenced cases panel sequenced cases were not included given the inherent limitation of panel testing to comprehensively detect dual diagnosis table acmg secondary findings were also very rare and were only identified in of exome sequenced cases on the other hand carrier status for previously established saudi pathogenic mutations was observed in a substantial fraction pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations were identified in nine genes with only tentative links to human diseases thus confirming their classification as bona fide disease genes table in addition our analysis highlighted genes that we propose as novel candidates based on a number of criteria table a few such candidates deserve a special emphasis akap was mutated in a patient with intellectual disability w through our internal matchmaking effort we were able to identify another de novo truncating variant in the same gene in a patient with intellectual disability nm_ c _ del p lys glufs thus it seems likely that this is a bona fide disease gene for intellectual disability in humans similarly we have identified independent deleterious variants in ubr in two families with very early onset dementia and this gene is involved in ubiquitin ligation a mechanism that is impaired in several neurodegenerative diseases so it seems likely that our analysis has uncovered a bone fide autosomal dominant form of early onset dementia parsons et al in w we identified an apparently loss of function variant in a gene whsc nm_ exon c g a long suspected to be the candidate gene for manifestations of wolf hirschhorn syndrome which overlaps significantly with our patient's features nimura et al table summarizes positive cases in which the molecular lesion was unexpected given the established phenotype for the respective gene for example n presented with a charge like presentation but was found to have a de novo variant in kmt a the gene responsible for kabuki syndrome we have previously suggested the overlap between charge and kabuki to be biologically relevant and this has been confirmed very recently by a large study butcher et al patel and alkuraya similarly w presented with progressive spasticity hyper reflexia and behavioral changes due to a homozygous truncating mutation in fam b this presentation is different from what has been different in the context of fam b mutation which is a form of hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy characterized by early childhood onset of distal sensory impairment usually resulting in ulceration and associated with variable autonomic features such as hyperhidrosis and urinary incontinence ilgaz aydinlar et al kurth et al with very few exceptions solved cases were positive for genes not suspected a priori by the ordering physician according to the information provided furthermore the correct molecular characterization of many patients led to immediate implementation of management changes examples include a child with maple syrup urine disease who was missed by newborn screening and presented at m of age with failure to thrive developmental regression abnormal hair exfoliative skin lesions and epilepsy n n presented with intellectual disability which was misdiagnosed as hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy but was found to have a novel startloss pten mutation thus enabling the treating physician to implement active tumor surveillance n is year old child who presented with unexplained chronic liver failure with hyperbilirubinemia and was being considered for liver transplant the finding that he has polycystic liver disease no cysts were identified on ultrasonography caused by an autosomal dominant prkcsh nm_ exon c g c mutation was very helpful in selecting an unaffected donor from his relatives n was managed for many years with anti inflammatory agents to treat her crohn's disease but she was found to have leukocyte adhesion molecule deficiency caused by itgb nm_ exon c c t p r w resulting in a drastically different management n presented in the nd year of life with severe nephrolithiasis and his management was significantly altered when he was found to have autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease pkd nm_ exon c g a p w x a known risk factor of nephrolithiasis although his very early presentation was unusual grampsas et al w is an year old child who was followed for seizures ataxia and learning disability but the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type i was missed until exome sequencing revealed a previously known pathogenic mutation in nf w is a year old child who was managed for years as a case of bartter syndrome but exome sequencing led to a change in management after revealing a pathogenic mutation in slc a thus establishing the correct diagnosis of chloride losing diarrhea is a year old child whose diagnosis of pyridoxine dependent epilepsy was missed until revealed by exome sequencing leading to immediate initiation of pyridoxine genetic studies on the saudi population have contributed significantly to the global effort of identifying the causal mutations of mendelian diseases particularly in the area of autosomal recessive diseases alkuraya the very characteristics that make this population a significant contributor to the analysis of recessive diseases i e consanguinity and large family size have also recently been exploited to advance our knowledge of other areas of human genetics research including dominant disorders by reclassifying dominant mutations when observed in homozygosity in individuals who lack the reported dominant phenotype and even common diseases by identifying mendelian phenocopies and by challenging or supporting gwas candidate genes when observed in individuals who are functional knockouts i e homozygous for loss of function alleles as a function of autozygosity abouelhoda et al monies et al maddirevula et al in press however despite the wealth of published data on genetic diseases in saudi arabia unbiased data on the overall distribution of these diseases and their genetic landscape are largely lacking our molecular diagnostic lab is the sole major referral ngs laboratory in saudi arabia as such it receives samples from patients with suspected genetic disorders from all healthcare sectors in the country private hospitals and practices as well as state funded healthcare system this provided us with a unique opportunity to observe and report a wide spectrum of phenotypes from all regions of the country as well as other countries in arabia oman and kuwait in a largely unbiased fashion in this report we describe our laboratory's prospective analysis of families referred for panel or exome sequencing the unbiased selection of the first samples has allowed us to derive important conclusions about the nature of genetic diseases in the country autosomal recessive disorders as expected accounted for the bulk of mendelian disease burden this is consistent with several previous reports including the very recent report by alfares and colleagues who retrospectively analyzed families that underwent exome sequencing by various commercial labs although they did not provide phenotyping information alfares et al it is noteworthy that enhanced autozygosity also led to several instances of autosomal recessive inheritance of strictly dominant genes these cases can improve our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of the dominant counterpart monies et al for example we report two families with a severe congenital myopathy phenotype each with a different homozygous truncating mutation in vamp inherited from healthy non ataxic parents this suggests that the dominant spinocerebellar ataxia previously reported in a family with a heterozygous vamp mutation may not be caused by haploinsufficiency as originally suggested but a different mechanism e g dominant negative bourassa et al furthermore the difference in phenotype between the observed recessive and previously reported dominant phenotypes should serve as a reminder that caution is warranted before dismissing variants in genes deemed irrelevant to the phenotype in question these cases also provide an alternative explanation to non manifesting carriers of clearly pathogenic mutations in dominant genes other than reduced penetrance i e truly recessive inheritance the predominance of autosomal recessive disorders also allowed us to perform molecular autopsy by proxy in families who lost children in the past due to recessive conditions but have no material left to test those children directly duo analysis of the parents allowed us to identify the likely causal mutation in the overwhelming majority the highlighted couple who lost three pregnancies neonates with three different disorders all of which were identified by duo exome sequencing is an example of the power of this approach it may be surprising that despite this trend we have only confirmed dual molecular diagnosis in of our cohort this could be attributed to our methodology we only considered dual diagnosis if both molecular lesions could be classified as at least likely pathogenic secondary findings represent a complicated ethical and practical issue in genomic sequencing in our analysis we followed the acmg recommendations of reporting only pathogenic likely pathogenic variants in the list of actionable genes kalia et al only of our cohort received positive results for this class of secondary findings consistent with previous studies dheensa et al however we also opted to report carrier status for a select list of pathogenic recessive mutations that we have previously characterized in our population although it is generally discouraged to disclose these results in the pediatric setting the very high rate of consanguinity in our population prompted us to consider the consequences of not disclosing this information the carrier status of the index essentially indicates that at least one parent is a carrier so if the other parent is related then the probability of both parents being carriers of the same mutant allele may not be rare thus we considered this an opportunity to prevent the occurrence of another recessive disease unrelated to the disease being tested by counseling parents about this possibility and offering them the option of being tested for their carrier status this class of secondary findings was positive in a large fraction of wes cases the establishment of novel links between genes and diseases remains a priority in human genetics research to enable the molecular diagnosis of all mendelian diseases in the near future the final percentage of genes that are linked to mendelian phenotypes remains a highly contested speculation boycott et al however large iterative sequencing efforts from the same population can provide helpful clues in this regard for example we have recently reported identification of novel disease genes in the context of developmental delay and intellectual disability in an unselected sample of patients anazi et al our identification of an additional novel candidate genes by exome sequencing patients from the same population seems to suggest that the number of yet to be identified genes with mutations etiologic in human disease remains large we suggest that two of these novel candidates appear to meet the standard cutoff of establishing disease gene link although the phenotype associated with akap is nonspecific developmental delay and seizures the phenotype we observe in the two families with different heterozygous variants in ubr is highly specific and consists of early onset dementia the remaining candidate genes will require independent confirmation in the future it is noteworthy that if all novel candidates are confirmed this will increase the yield of exome sequencing to which suggests that most clinical exomes that are reported as negative by clinical laboratories are reported as such due to interpretation rather than technical limitations as we have proposed in an earlier work shamseldin et al in conclusion this is the largest diagnostic genomic sequencing study of an unselected clinical cohort from saudi arabia with suspected genetic disease from a single clinical sequencing lab in addition to providing numerous examples of phenotypic expansion we report the first autosomal recessive inheritance of genes that have thus far been linked to human diseases only in a dominant fashion we add novel variants in known disease genes and proposed genes as novel disease candidates two of which are independently mutated in more than one family with the same phenotype it is hoped that the results of this study will improve the diagnostic yield of genomic sequencing locally and globally
 analysis of year old patient with syngap gene defect points to importance of variants in broader splice regions and reveals developmental trajectory of syngap associated phenotype case report whole exome sequencing is a powerful tool for the analysis of genetically heterogeneous conditions the prioritization of variants identified often focuses on nonsense frameshift and canonical splice site mutations and highly deleterious missense variants although other defects can also play a role the definition of the phenotype range and course of rare genetic conditions requires long term clinical follow up of patients we report an adult female patient with severe intellectual disability severe speech delay epilepsy autistic features aggressiveness sleep problems broad based clumsy gait and constipation whole exome sequencing identified a de novo mutation in the syngap gene the variant was located in the broader splice donor region of intron and replaced g by a at position of the splice site the variant was predicted in silico and shown experimentally to abolish the regular splice site and to activate a cryptic donor site within exon causing frameshift and premature termination the overall clinical picture of the patient corresponded well with the characteristic syngap associated phenotype observed in previously reported patients however our patient was years old which contrasted with most other published syngap cases who were much younger our patient had a significant growth delay and microcephaly both features normalised later although the head circumference stayed only slightly above the lower limit of the norm the patient had a delayed puberty her cognitive and language performance remained at the level of a one year old child even in adulthood and showed a slow decline myopathic facial features and facial dysmorphism became more pronounced with age although the gait of the patient was unsteady in childhood more severe gait problems developed in her teens while the seizures remained well controlled her aggressive behaviour worsened with age and required extensive medication the finding in our patient underscores the notion that the interpretation of variants identified using whole exome sequencing should focus not only on variants in the canonical splice dinucleotides gt and ag but also on broader splice regions the long term clinical follow up of our patient contributes to the knowledge of the developmental trajectory in individuals with syngap gene defects the online version of this article doi s contains supplementary material which is available to authorized users keywords syngap gene intellectual disability epilepsy splice mutation splice region whole exome sequencing syngap synaptic ras gtpase activating protein is localised in dendritic spines of neocortical pyramidal neurons it is a component of the synaptic signalling regulation pathway in this pathway the n methyl d aspartate receptor nmdar is activated by glutamate to allow the entry of ca ions into the postsynaptic space this triggers calmodulin dependent protein kinase ii camkii phosphorylation camkii then phosphorylates and activates syngap which in turn activates ras and rap this leads to endocytosis of the amino hydroxy methyl isoxazolepropionic acid receptor ampar a major excitatory neurotransmitter receptor of the central nervous system and repression of ampar trafficking to excitatory postsynaptic membrane the pathway is the key regulator of synaptic plasticity while mice with heterozygous knockout of the mouse syngap homologue show impaired behaviour and cognition complete deficiency of the gene is lethal in humans de novo heterozygous syngap mutations cause mild to severe intellectual disability id syngap mutation carriers often have generalised epilepsy absent or severely delayed speech aggressiveness sleep problems and broad based clumsy gait about half of the patients show autistic behaviour syngap appears to be one of the most frequently mutated id causing genes with mutations possibly explaining to of id mutations were reported throughout the whole gene with the exception of the most ' and ' exons until now different point mutations or indels have been described in patients out of this mutations were frameshift were nonsense were splicing were missense and one was both missense and splicing reviewed in the syngap associated phenotype is most likely caused by haploinsufficiency of the syngap gene and its protein product in this report we describe an adult female patient with a de novo mutation in the syngap gene identified using whole exome sequencing wes the variant is in the splice donor region of intron but it does not affect the canonical splice donor dinucleotide gt instead it replaces g by a at position of intron the variant was predicted in silico and shown experimentally to affect splicing by abolishing the regular splice site and by activating a cryptic donor site within exon therefore this observation underscores the importance of considering variants not only in the canonical splice donor and acceptor dinucleotides gt and ag but also in broader splice regions while the overall phenotype of the patient is rather similar to the previously published patients with syngap defects she is years old which contrasts with most other published syngap cases who were much younger thus our study contributes to the knowledge of development of the phenotype associated with syngap gene defects the currently year old female was first seen at our institution at the age of years due to severe id epilepsy and autistic features the previous history of the patient was reconstructed from medical records photographs and parental interviews the patient fig a h was born from an uneventful pregnancy of unrelated healthy parents at birth of the girl the mother and father were aged and years respectively the patient had one older sister who suffered from anorexia nervosa a paternal cousin of the mother of the patient had down syndrome the maternal grandmother of the mother of the patient suffered from multiple sclerosis and a maternal aunt of the father of the patient had schizophrenia the development of the patient in the prenatal and perinatal periods was largely normal the labour was spontaneous in the nd week of gestation the birth weight was g th centile and the length was cm th centile postnatal adaptation was uncomplicated except poor suck the patient was breastfed shortly and throve on artificial nutrition till two years of age at around three years of age a period of food refusal started and the girl ended up on glucose infusions till eight years of age such periods repeated at least three times since eight years of age she has eaten almost everything but she did not chew and her dependence on ground food worsened with age constipation has been a major problem since the age of one year with unsuccessful anal sphincter surgery at the age of years the developmental milestones of the girl have been significantly delayed from the age of six months despite physiotherapy she stood up at the age of months and achieved independent sitting and walking without support at the age of months and three years respectively her gait was unsteady with frequent crashes currently her posture and gait resemble crouch gait with anteflexed neck and increased flexion of the knees although this wide based gait with bent knees was not observed till the age of years her hands are dystonic and tremor appears with voluntary movement the speech development started on time the patient started crooning at the age of three months and pronouncing syllables at the age of months later she started to use a few words but her verbal skills have stopped at the level of a one year old child the patient had significant growth delay the skeletal maturation and the onset of puberty were delayed by about four years the first menstrual period occurred at the age of years in childhood and early adolescence the patient had a gracile habitus and microcephaly at the age of years her height was cm rd centile weight was kg below the rd centile and head circumference hc was cm below the rd centile at the age of years the height was cm th centile weight was kg th centile and hc was not measured because of lack of cooperation at the age of years the height was cm th centile the weight was kg th centile and the hc was cm th centile at the age of two months the patient developed strabism which was corrected by surgery at the age of months the facial phenotype in early childhood was not remarkable with a possible exception of full cheeks and larger ears later she started to show open mouth appearance and a long narrow face at the age of years her facial dysmorphism included long hypomimic face prominent chin narrow almond shaped palpebral fissures long nose with prominent nasal bridge and overhanging columella open mouth appearance high arched palate large upper teeth protruding from the mouth wide lower lip and large ears she had long cone shaped fingers with th finger clinodactyly and haluces valgi since years of age the myopathic facial features have become more prominent the face has become longer and more coarse in appearance and a protuberant chin has been more evident currently the patient has her mouth constantly open with protruding upper incisors and the teeth are irregularly stored dysarthria and hypersalivation are also present the patient was an irritable baby with back arching and frequent startle reactions seizures started at the age of two years ictal behavioural arrest with blinking was followed by head drop and fall she never had any other type of seizures topiramate was the most effective drug in controlling the epileptic paroxysms although many other antiepileptic drugs have been used since being on topiramate medication she has been completely free of seizures eeg repeatedly showed generalized irregular sw discharges cerebral mri at the age of years was normal she started to show self harming behaviour at four years of age she was hitting her head and later around puberty she started biting herself which led to extensive bruising aggression became evident at preschool age and had a tendency to worsen with age since the age of years the aggression has become uncontrollable and the patient has been treated with a series of antidepressants and behaviour damping medication currently aggressiveness appears only occasionally as an infant she used to wake up several times at night and she continues to have problems with sleep initiation and has a short sleep time at the age of five years a diagnosis of autism was first proposed and later the girl was diagnosed with pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified with severe id currently at the age of years the patient suffers from severe to profound id and hyperactivity autistic features were predominantly observed at the pre school age although they improved with age and currently are less evident the insistence on sameness persists as well as oversensitivity to certain sounds on the other hand the patient likes physical closeness and contact karyotyping was performed according to standard protocols genomic dna of the patient was analysed using the human cytosnp beadchips illumina san diego ca usa according to the manufacturer's protocol for wes of the family trio seqcap ez human exome library v roche nimblegen madison wi usa was used for exome capture and hiseq system illumina was utilised for paired end massive parallel sequencing see additional file for details on microarray and wes data analysis the syngap variant and its de novo nature were confirmed by sanger sequencing of fragments amplified from the dna of the family trio using primers targeting exon and intron the bioinformatic prediction of the impact of the variant on splicing was performed using programs human splicing finder maxent nnsplice netgene esefinder alternative splice site predictor assp splice port and cryp skip see additional file for details on primer sequences and data analysis rna was extracted from whole blood of the patient her parents and normal controls using the paxgene blood rna kit preanalytix hombrechtikon switzerland rt pcr was performed using superscript iii one step rt pcr system with platinum taq dna polymerase invitrogen carlsbad ca usa and primers targeting syngap exons and the resulting cdna fragments were sanger sequenced karyotyping and microarray analysis of the patient did not reveal any significant aberrations wes of the family trio identified a single de novo heterozygous variant in the syngap gene chr hg nm_ c g a in the patient which was confirmed using sanger sequencing fig a the variant was classified as a splice region variant as it affected position of the splice donor of intron the variant was absent in public variant databases all tools used for the in silico analysis of the effect of the variant on splicing predicted disruption of the donor splice site of intron and two tools which allowed also the prediction of the outcome cryp skip and assp predicted the activation of a cryptic site in exon predicted to be bp upstream of the regular site using assp rather than skipping of the whole exon see additional file for details several much less strong candidate variants inherited by the patient from one of her unaffected parents were also identified and are listed in additional file rt pcr experiments with syngap cdna primers detected novel splicing products in the patient which were absent in the parents and normal controls the variant indeed activated the predicted cryptic splice donor site bp upstream of the regular end of exon because of the existence of an alternative splice acceptor site in intron located bp upstream of the regular start of exon which was also predicted using assp two transcripts could be detected in the parents and controls the regular transcript with a regular junction of exons and and an alternative transcript where the end of exon was joined to the last bp of intron the alternative start of exon fig b c the alternative transcript contained a frameshift and a premature stop codon p val leufs in the patient four different transcripts could be detected the two described above and two which joined the activated cryptic donor site thus lacking the last bp of exon with the regular and alternative start of exon both these transcripts also contained frameshifts and premature stop codons p cys serfs and p cys serfs the syngap variant nm_ c g a identified in our patient was the sole de novo variant found in her exome it was absent in databases of normal genetic variation and it was predicted and experimentally confirmed to have a disruptive effect on mrna splicing this together with the firmly established role of the syngap gene in id and the phenotypic match between our patient and previously published patients with syngap defects strongly implicated the variant as causal for the disorder in our patient the variant affected an intronic position in the broader splice donor region contrary to variants in the well known invariant splice site dinucleotides gt and ag most variant prioritising pipelines do not assign the highest priority to variants in broader splice regions the case of our patient clearly shows that these variants can also be detrimental for correct mrna splicing particularly the intronic position seems to be especially important as the base g usually present in this position is among the most conserved in the consensus sequence of splice donor sites based on the conservation patterns at least variants in positions to and to should be explored in the broader splice donor and acceptor regions respectively for the assessment of the effect of the variant on syngap mrna splicing we used in silico prediction and laboratory analysis both approaches indicated a disruption of the regular splice donor site and activation of a cryptic site within exon leading to frameshift and loss of function of the variant allele an acceptor site bp upstream of the regular start of exon was also predicted and the usage of this site was confirmed experimentally both in normal controls and in the patient database search indicated that the distal part of intron was expressed also in multiple cell lines from the encode project the inclusion of this segment results in premature termination and the biological meaning of this alternative splicing event is unclear therefore we could observe a total of three transcripts with predicted premature termination codons one in normal controls and three in the patient as our experimental conditions did not block nonsense mediated rna decay nmd the transcripts seem not to be subject of nmd this may reflect the fact that the efficiency of nmd in lymphocytes is lower than in other cell types it has to be stressed that our experiment using peripheral blood lymphocyte mrna may not fully reflect the expression of syngap in the brain also it is not clear if the transcripts with premature termination codons can indeed serve for the production of truncated proteins nevertheless the variant syngap allele present in the patient definitely lost the capacity to produce the normal transcript and the full length protein our patient shared many clinical features with previously published patients reviewed in while de novo mutations in syngap were initially reported to cause non syndromic id later reports described more syndromic cases the phenotype of our patient supports the existence of a specific syngap associated phenotype characterised predominantly by mild to severe id epilepsy severe speech delay aggressiveness sleep problems broad based clumsy gait autism and constipation the development of our patient has also been delayed since infancy and her motor and speech abilities stopped at the level of a one year old child the seizures head drops and eyelid myoclonia were similar to other cases with syngap defects and no specific seizure triggers could be revealed after initial polytherapy long term seizure freedom was achieved by topiramate the behavioural disturbances observed such as restlessness temper tantrums and aggression were noted also in other patients with syngap mutations just as the sleep disorder insomnia and frequent night time awakenings the gait of our patient was unsteady and she had intermittent tremor and dystonic posturing of her hands her face had myopathic features constipation has been a major issue in the everyday life of our patient since infancy although this feature was not reported among the characteristics in the latest patient series and review earlier cases showed this symptom and our patient supports the association of constipation with syngap defects genetic testing performed in our patient prior to wes included testing for angelman syndrome which was also the case of patients reported previously this may indicate a possible phenotypic overlap and suggest that the syngap associated phenotype could be considered a differential diagnosis to angelman syndrome we could follow up the patient till her adulthood and this allowed us to observe the developmental trajectory of her phenotype contrary to most reports which described much younger patients between the age of one year and adulthood there was no sharp regression but rather a continuous slow decline in her cognitive and speech abilities autistic behaviour was most pronounced at preschool age and although later it showed some improvement some symptoms are constantly present while the seizures remained well controlled her aggressive behaviour worsened with age and required medication microcephaly which was observed in childhood gradually normalised and after puberty which was significantly delayed the hc has been slightly above the lower limit of the normal range other growth parameters have also normalised after puberty with increasing age the facial appearance of our patient has become coarser and the myopathic facies with open mouth appearance and protruding teeth have become more pronounced the gait problems worsened significantly in her teens thus our observations indicate that in our patient the developmental trajectory of the syngap associated phenotype continues to show a specific dynamics in adolescence and adulthood
 the eight and a half year journey of undiagnosed ad gene sequencing and funding of advanced genetic testing has led to hope and new beginnings activity dependent neuroprotective protein adnp is one of the most prevalent de novo mutated genes in syndromic autism spectrum disorders driving a general interest in the gene and the syndrome the aim of this study was to provide a detailed developmental case study of adnp p tyr mutation toward improvements in diagnostic procedures phenotypic scope and interventions longitudinal clinical and parental reports ad currently year old had several rare congenital anomalies including imperforate anus that was surgically repaired at days of age her findings were craniofacial asymmetries global developmental delay autistic behaviors loss of smile and inability to make eye contact at the age of months and slow thriving as she gradually matures comprehensive diagnostic procedures at years resulted in no definitive diagnosis with parental persistence ad began walking at years skipping crawling at the age of years ad was subjected to whole exome sequencing compared to the parents and diagnosed as carrying an adnp p tyr mutation a causal recurring mutation in adnp currently worldwide brain magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated mild generalized cerebral volume loss with reduced posterior white matter ad is non verbal communicating with signs and word approximations she continues to make slow but forward developmental progress and her case teaches newly diagnosed children within the adnp kids research foundation this case study emphasizes the importance of diagnosis and describes for the first time early motor intervention therapies detailed developmental profile of selected cases leads to better treatments keywords activity dependent neuroprotective protein case study mutation nonsense motor delays autism spectrum disorder looking at neuroglial interactions we gozes group discovered activity dependent neuroprotective protein adnp as a protein secreted from glial cells in the presence of vasoactive intestinal peptide vip which mediates vip's neuroprotective activity further cloning revealed high conservation and specificity to vertebrates the large human adnp hadnp gene structure kb includes five exons and four introns with alternative splicing of an untranslated second exon chromosome q a region associated with aggressive tumor growth as we described hadnp is also mutated in cancer knocking out adnp in mice resulted in embryonic death at the time of neural tube closure revealing that adnp is crucial for brain formation adnp haploinsufficient mice survive but show learning and memory deficits in a sex dependent manner at the protein level we have shown multiple crucial interactions for adnp including direct binding to the chromatin remodeling complex swi snf and interaction with heterochromatin protein alpha this study was extended to show that adnp interacts with all hp proteins toward histone posttranslational modification at the transcriptional level adnp binds to the locus control region of the beta globin gene to regulate globin transcription as well as the promoter regions of apolipoprotein e cathepsin c cathepsin z metallothionein neurogenin and myosin regulatory light chain at the rna splicing level adnp interacts with brahma a component of the swi snf complex regulating alternative splicing that shows a similar developmental expression pattern to adnp immunoprecipitations further suggested binding between adnp and polypyrimidine tract binding protein associated splicing factor psf with psf being a direct regulator of the microtubule associated tau transcript splicing further interaction with the protein translation machinery was shown with the eukaryotic translation initiation factor e eif e through direct binding as well as sex and age dependent regulation notably eif e is linked to autism in the neuronal cell cytoplasm adnp is critical for neurite outgrowth and maintenance through direct interaction by its sip motif with microtubule end binding proteins the microtubule system is tightly associated with the autophagy system and adnp binds the microtubule associated protein light chain b with these key regulatory functions adnp controls the expression of genes during embryonic development and of thousands of hippocampal genes postnatally impacting pathways associated with ion channels synaptic transmission in a sex and age dependent manner from a clinical point of view an adnp gene deletion was first implicated in delayed cognitive development in a case study in further findings included the first de novo p lys valfs mutation in the adnp gene in a large cohort of autistic patients large scale sequencing study analyzing probands identified an additional p tyr de novo adnp mutation and this is the subject of our current publication helsmoortel et al grouped patients with mutations in adnp as all patients suffered from autism with intellectual deficiencies and shared characteristic facial features it was concluded that mutations in adnp cause a syndromic form of autism two additional patients were further described sharing the reported characteristics interestingly pescosolido et al described another case of p tyr de novo adnp mutation suggesting that this is a recurrent mutation coe et al also reported five patients with a truncating adnp mutation in a screening of patients with autism id de rubeis et al identified three more patients of a total of screened and the ddd project reported four novel cases out of screened we have summarized the above in an introductory remark to the story of tony sermone presenting an additional adnp mutation l rfs a short synopsis of the clinical phenotype was recently published additional mutations are discovered and information extended and an extensive description is in preparation van dijck et al in preparation interestingly a recent publication suggested that adnp is one of three major genes associated with autism spectrum disorder asd complementing the original estimation of the adnp related syndrome constituting of asd cases these findings mark adnp as one of the most frequent asd associated genes known to date therefore further understanding of the adnp related syndrome is of general interest both from a case study point of view as well as from a population perspective here we chose to present one case study and concentrate for the first time on delays in motor development longitudinal clinical and parental reports were collected focusing on diagnosis phenotypic scope and

see the disproportion of ad's small tapered legs from the knees to the feet compared to the rest of her body this finding attests to the importance of adnp in muscle and bone development and to the regulation of key gene proteins beyond embryonic development ad started walking with a walker at years of age skipping crawling table table b figure figure a a walking short distances resulted in skin redness and muscle pain she began walking independently at the age of years the following year presented daily challenges in her functional walking she often could not stand for more than a few seconds climbing stairs was a third milestone using the strong leg and pushing the weaker leg after until about the age of ad had severe muscle tightness that mimicked symptoms of a neuromuscular disorder the muscle tightness was associated with severe sleep disturbances table table b last raw at years and months the parents noticed that she had more of a delay with gross motor skills than with fine albeit both delayed she walked independently but with a broad based and antalgic gait table table b figure figure a a at years of age she was ambulatory and quite flexible with increased range of motion noted particularly in the small joints physically hands were broad with short and broad fingers and fifth finger clinodactyly distal phalanges appeared short and fingernails were

table e scans demonstrated mild generalized cerebral volume loss with reduced posterior white matter the study showed periatrial signal hyperintensity that had resolved by the corpus callosum appeared relatively proportional to the overall volume loss but slightly foreshortened consistent with brachycephaly the right lateral ventricle was more asymmetric than normal and much of that can be attributed to the incompletely inverted hippocampus on that side with a low lying fornix the frontal and temporal extra axial spaces were enlarged in but had resolved by craniofacial dysmorphism

peeden was obtained at years showing adnp de novo gene mutation g g c cdna c c g protein p tyr diagnosis was obtained by whole exome sequencing compared to the parents with the adnp kids belonging to a family of affected children suffering many similar abnormalities further solutions are on the horizon to provide information advocacy and emotional support to families worldwide e g ref an adnp syndrome parents group was established on the social networking site facebook this is facing the time like other support groups for versatile diseases currently families are assembled connected through the original set up of adnp asd mutations the parents formed a table of traits which are shown for ad table table a d several other adnp associated traits are visible when looking at table table including auditory impediments suggesting an involvement of adnp in the development of all senses ad was spared heart abnormalities and seizures however as these affect other adnp children she is closely observed ad shares the same mutation with several other children e g ref a parent questionnaire of individuals with adnp p tyr or a close mutation indicated cognitive including speech and motor delays as well as autistic features and brain abnormalities which are further investigated figure figure c c shows representative pictures of three additional adnp p tyr children exhibiting potential facial similarities and using standing and walking devices table table e the adnp p tyr is an integral part of the adnp related syndrome encompassing other adnp mutations van dijck et al in preparation in general a helmet treatment was implemented for cranial asymmetry table table a proved to be successful and should be implemented in future cases in this respect all children with adnp mutations show motor delays see text footnote the painful doubt whether ad would be wheelchair bound drove the parents to seek help physical therapy began at the age of months she had multitude therapies at home collaborative clinic early intervention developmental playgroups and private clinic water therapy for example she had physical and occupational therapy hippotherapy involving an occupational therapist a physiotherapist or a speech and language therapist working with ad and a horse to present challenges and to promote different postural responses and aquatic therapy at one point she was given up to therapies a week at the age of her therapist and the orthotics tailor made shoes with an inside lift to accommodate her left leg shortness she then began to wear ankle foot orthosis brace to her knee covering her entire foot the physical therapist devised fabric braces with velcro with metal bars that did not allow her to bend her knee forcing her to bare weight her father has further built a standing device made of wood and pvc pipes to aid in her timed standing to ensure that she would not incur atrophy in her lower limbs legs following this parents were advised of gait trainers and other newly engineered products that help children like ad ad further used a surfboard therapy machine that helped her core balance and many mirrors and began making a connection basic standing on her own was her first milestone followed by the use of a pediatric walker table table b picture walking short distances resulted in skin redness and muscle pain which were relieved with warm baths and pool therapy the parents further used a treadmill program e g http www taap project com in physical therapy to strengthen ad and built new pathways and signals to help her motor planning and focus on the repetition of steps metronome was a program that they have also used that proved to be successful notably the physical therapist persisted despite ad's severe unknown motor movement disorder and continued to increase the frequency of land and water therapies toward success she was treated with over h combined physical and aquatic therapies between the ages of years without a medical billing code for doctors to use the term global delay did not guarantee insurance coverage nor did it describe the medical complexity of ad this resulted in expenses of over per summer during the walk therapies currently ad gets biweekly physical therapies to maintain and further improve her mobility and has begun growth hormone therapy age aiming to bring her back to the growth chart ad was recently diagnosed with apraxia of speech table table e and traditional speech therapy may not benefit her as much as focus on oral motor planning she is now receiving this specialized therapy as her evaluation showed she desires to speak tries and makes approximations but similar to walking cannot put it together the z vibes oral motor tool has been most successful for the children with adnp mutation who speak closed adnp syndrome parents group facebook ad has used it as a small child with no obvious results but now it seems to be having a significant effect additionally the kaufmann kit which uses cards to teach children to combine consonants and vowels to form words while controlling for oral motor difficulty is also helping ad as a small child she was not able to understand but now these cards are used in combination with prompt therapy prompts for restructuring oral muscular phonetic targets with physical cueing and repetition of the cards ad now has some approximations for sounds such as meh na and beh for me no and bye respectively over the years ad's educational team has indicated that the autism symptoms have become less prevalent with access to a speaking device a card system and multimodal communication system ad is now flourishing her improved communication shows an amazing personality which is humorous and lively from a scientific point of view we strive to have tailored drugs to treat the adnp children early enough to avoid confounding developmental delays in this respect we gozes have been developing nap napvsipq the shortest active snippet of adnp nap increases adnp's activity at the cellular level in terms of cellular protection as well as synaptic plasticity on the whole animal level it provides cognitive protection in mice with adnp deficiencies nap has also shown protective activity in over cell culture systems and in over animal models notable examples include schizophrenia alzheimer's disease frontotemporal dementia amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and most importantly cognitive deficiencies associated with asd as well as developmental delays linked to prenatal and postnatal toxicities nap also called davunetide has shown activity in clinical trials it increased cognitive scores in a phase iia clinical trial in patients suffering from amnestic mild cognitive impairment and protected functional daily activities as well as brain cellular activity measured by mri in schizophrenia patients nap davunetide is safe and bioavailable clinical studies in the adnp related syndrome are currently planned with nap now called cp coronis neurosciences the described complex syndrome of motor dysfunction autism speech delay and facial dysmorphism should trigger gene sequencing and early diagnosis of children with the adnp syndrome also known as the helsmoortel van der aa syndrome the case of ad highlights global developmental delays with emphasis on motor functions which was not described before while ad had not always been referred to the appropriate specialized therapies her family persistence and ultimate success in motor development should help guide newly diagnosed children this report teaches modes of interventions and paves the path to basic discoveries on adnp's involvement in muscle development ad's major impediment nowadays is her inability to talk a trait that has been lagging behind in this respect better understanding of adnp's association with muscle development may shed light on speech development as well the more we understand about the adnp protein and gene the better we can help the families and patients with syndromic developmental dysfunctions gain enhanced functionality and integration into a healthy society coupled with adnp replacement enhancement therapies such as cp coronis neurosciences see text footnote
 chromosome p deletion spanning the grin b gene presenting with a neurodevelopmental phenotype the grin b glutamate receptor ionotropic n methyl d aspartate b gene located in the short arm of chromosome encoding the nr b subunit of the n methyl d aspartate receptor has recently been recognized to play an important role in corticogenesis and brain plasticity deletions in the short arm of chromosome are rare hemizygous loss of function of the grin b gene results in developmental delay whereas gain of function leads to epilepsy and infantile spasms in particular in addition grin b variants have been associated with autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia here the authors report a child with global developmental delay autistic behavioural features central hypotonia dysmorphic features and isolated congenital anomalies of the fingers and toes and a de novo heterozygous deletion in chromosome locus p p involving loss of several genes including grin b this report and our review of the literature help clarify the distinct phenotypes associated with loss or gain of grin b function keywords chromosome p deletion cdkn b grin b etv neurodevelopment autism spectrum disorder while disorders associated with deletions in the short arm of chromosome p deletion syndrome were described prior to the advent of array based comparative genomic hybridization with its emergence it became possible to correlate clinical phenotypes with particular genes the p grin b glutamate receptor ionotropic n methyl d aspartate b gene plays a critical role in mammalian brain development and different mutations are associated with entirely distinct neurodevelopmental epileptic and psychiatric disorders here the authors present a detailed description of a year old boy with heterozygous de novo interstitial microdeletion at p p encompassing grin b and review the literature our case and review help to clarify and contrast the loss of function neurodevelopmental and gain of function epileptic grin b phenotypes our patient was born at term via spontaneous vaginal delivery to nonconsanguineous parents routine antenatal ultrasound during the rd week of gestation revealed a large head circumference and improper closure of the cerebral ventricles this was not seen on the postnatal head ultrasound at delivery there was light meconium present however no resuscitation was required he developed transient respiratory distress his birth weight was lbs and oz th percentile echocardiography at the time showed a patent foramen ovale family history was significant for developmental delay and primary gastrointestinal malignancies in some family members the patient's eldest brother now years old was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder he had moderate to severe language delay fine motor delay motor planning difficulties and academic challenges his younger brother now years old had isolated speech delay our patient's paternal grandfather had a history of speech and language delay paternal grandmother had a benign colon tumor removed at age years and paternal nephew was found to have an appendiceal tumor at age of years a paternal uncle was diagnosed with gastrointestinal cancer in his mid s our index case was noted to have central hypotonia since the first week of life and global developmental delay since early infancy predominantly affecting motor and language domains he never exhibited any regression he developed adequate head control around months was able to sit with support by months and unsupported by months he could transition from supine to sitting at months and started to pull to stand after months he started ambulating independently at years but still had frequent falls due to poor balance he required foot orthotics due to abnormalities in foot ankle alignment during independent ambulation he developed bilateral pincer grasp at around months and was able to spoon feed himself by months at years he was scribbling with a pen but could not draw discreet lines or shapes language development was significantly delayed at years his vocabulary consisted of approximately words which expanded to to single spontaneous words by age his main method of communication was nonverbal with gestures receptive language was comparatively better but nonetheless delayed cognitively he could identify his own body parts was able to follow simple step commands and knew primary colors and few numbers he developed a social smile early in infancy and began to laugh around months he had social interest in peers and was able to initiate and interact in reciprocal play he engaged in some simple pretend play by months he also demonstrated some mild repetitive behaviors such as turning on off switches and closing doors repeatedly by age along with restricted play themes also notable were some sensory aversions including aversion to certain tactile and auditory stimuli in terms of his adaptive skills at age he was not showing any interest in toilet training and was unable to dress himself he had normal ophthalmological and hearing assessments and had no clinical seizures at months his weight and height were near the th percentile and head circumference was just above the th percentile he had facial dysmorphisms and minor congenital abnormalities of his digits and toes as described in figure he also had a high anterior hairline with a single posterior hair whorl along with clinodactyly of his fifth digits bilaterally on neurological examination he was interactive with interest in his external environment he was able to spontaneously produce few meaningful words his cranial nerves motor and sensory examination were unremarkable except for mild truncal hypotonia and poor balance while walking other systemic examinations were normal his complete blood count liver renal and thyroid function tests serum lactate ammonia creatine kinase carnitine quantitative acylcarnitine profile amino acid and urine organic acid were unremarkable magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was deferred due to parental concern about risks of anesthesia electroencephalography showed spike and wave discharges over the right posterior parietal head region array based comparative genomic hybridization revealed a mb hemizygous loss at chromosomal locus p p chr to bp hg fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis confirmed the deletion observed by microarray analysis fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses of parental samples indicated that the deletion was de novo microarray analysis of his eldest brother was normal the authors describe a child with global developmental delay central hypotonia autistic behavioral features facial dysmorphisms incomplete syndactyly thumb duplication and clinodactyly with focal electroencephalography abnormalities and a de novo deletion at p p this deletion results in loss of copy of refseq genes including omim online mendelian inheritance in man morbid genes that include grin b cdkn b cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor b etv ets variant and lrp low density lipoprotein receptor related protein grin b encodes the nr subunit of the n methyl d aspartate receptor and is expressed within striatal and cortical structures while ours would be the second report of confirmed hemizygous deletion of grin b there are already sufficient descriptions of patients with hemizygous loss of function indicating that most if not all of the neurodevelopmental phenotype of our patient is due to loss of one of the two alleles of this gene table summarizes the salient neurodevelopmental features of all the cases to date including ours and allows crystallization of the core neurodevelopmental syndrome of hemizygous loss of grin b which encompasses delay in motor and speech development in particular expressive language with various degree of intellectual disability and behavioral difficulties such as hyperactivity and oppositional behavior and focal interictal electroencephalography abnormalities predominantly unaccompanied by clinical seizures a gain of function in the grin b gene has also recently been implicated to cause a severe form of epileptic encephalopathy manifesting as west syndrome although our patient has focal electroencephalography abnormalities he has not had any clinical seizures at the time of the submission of this manuscript this may be due to a loss of function as opposed to a gain of function in the grin b gene manifesting as two separate phenotypes the latter consisting mainly of neurodevelopmental disorder with global developmental delay and intellectual disability and the former causing an epileptic encephalopathy other types of mutations in grin b gene nonsense splice site and frameshift have also been identified in patients with cognitive and intellectual impairments various neurobehavioral disorders statistically associated with grin b gene variants including autistic spectrum disorder obsessive compulsive disorder schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have been described n methyl d aspartate receptors are tetrameric ligand gated ion channels composed of glycine binding nr subunits and glutamate binding nr subunits nr a nr b nr c and nr d grin b represents a rate limiting genetic factor in gating the n methyl d aspartate receptor's function in the developing and mature mammalian brain the subunit composition of n methyl d aspartate receptors is spatially and temporally regulated it undergoes a maturational change from heterotetramers containing predominantly nr b early in life to those containing nr b nr a or both subunits in the adult brain grin b has also been shown to be involved in long term potentiation of synaptic transmission the mechanism purported in memory and learning processes mutations in the grin b gene leads to abnormal subunit functioning affecting neuronal ion flux resulting in developmental abnormalities and epilepsy deletions in the short arm of chromosome are also associated with a wide variety of hematopoietic malignancies due to mutation of the known tumor suppressor genes etv and cdkn b both of which are also part of our patient's deletion germline heterozygous mutations in cdkn b have been described in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia hemizygous deletions encompassing cdkn b have also been reported with small intestine neuroendocrine tumors similarly several somatic heterozygous mutations of etv gene involving translocation and fusion with various other genes have been reported with acute and chronic leukemia germline variants of both cdkn b and etv are associated with adult predisposition to prostate cancer as such our patient and children with similar chromosomal deletion grin b developmental delay should be monitored for neoplastic risk in conclusion hemizygous loss of function of grin b leads to intellectual disability developmental delays particularly in language hyperactivity and oppositional behavior and abnormal electroencephalography but rare or no seizures in contrast gain of function in this gene is one cause of west syndrome likely due to its central neurological role as part of the n methyl d aspartate receptor variants likely affecting its expression are associated with common neurobehavioral disorders including schizophrenia and autism
 phelan mcdermid syndrome presenting with developmental delays and facial dysmorphisms phelan mcdermid syndrome is a rare genetic disorder caused by the terminal or interstitial deletion of the chromosome q patients with this syndrome usually have global developmental delay hypotonia and speech delays several putative genes such as the shank rab rabl b and ib are responsible for the neurological features this study describes the clinical features and outcomes of korean patients with phelan mcdermid syndrome two patients showing global developmental delay hypotonia and speech delay were diagnosed with phelan mcdermid syndrome via chromosome analysis fluorescent in situ hybridization and multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification analysis brain magnetic resonance imaging of patients and showed delayed myelination and severe communicating hydrocephalus respectively electroencephalography in patient showed high amplitude spike discharges from the left frontotemporoparietal area but neither patient developed seizures kidney ultrasonography of both the patients revealed multicystic kidney disease and pelviectasis respectively patient experienced recurrent respiratory infections and chest computed tomography findings demonstrated laryngotracheomalacia and bronchial narrowing he subsequently died because of heart failure after a ventriculoperitoneal shunt operation at months of age patient who is currently months old has been undergoing rehabilitation therapy however global developmental delay was noted as determines using the korean infant and child development test the denver developmental test and the bayley developmental test this report describes the clinical features outcomes and molecular genetic characteristics of two korean patients with phelan mcdermid syndrome keywords phelan mcdermid syndrome chromosome q deletion syndrome shank phelan mcdermid syndrome pms is a rare genetic disorder caused by the deletion of chromosome q infants or children with this syndrome manifest diverse clinical features such as seizures hypotonia absent or severely delayed speech global developmental delay hearing and visual impairment strabismus autism like behavior cyclic vomiting normal or advanced growth and precocious puberty patients with pms also present minor dysmorphic facial features such as deep set eyes poorly formed ears and a bulbous nose the neurological features of this syndrome are nonspecific and it can be underrecognized along with other genetic diseases that show developmental delays the mental retardation and developmental delays of these patients are mainly caused by deletions of the sh and multiple ankyrin repeat domains shank genes the shank gene encodes a structural protein located in the post synaptic membrane and plays an important role in signal transduction chromosome analysis is required for evaluation of congenital anomalies and developmental delay however it is not suitable for detecting microdeletion therefore fluorescence in situ hybridization fish or multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification mlpa analysis is commonly utilized to identify the microdeletion of the chromosome q region in addition array comparative genomic hybridization is a useful method for discovering unbalanced translocations to date over cases of pms have been reported worldwide however only case has been reported in korea this report describes the clinical features outcomes and molecular data of two patients with pms in korea a month old female who was born after weeks of gestation with a birth weight of g was referred to our outpatient clinic an abdominal mass was found during the prenatal ultrasonography and postnatal ultrasonography determined that it was a multicystic dysplastic kidney although renal function was normal the patient underwent ligation surgery for patent ductus arteriosus at age weeks at age months her eyes could not follow objects and she displayed hypotonia her weight height and head circumference were kg th th percentile cm th percentile and cm th th percentile respectively she had low set ears deep set eyes wide eyebrows and a bulbous nose brain magnetic resonance imaging mri revealed delayed myelination fig a high amplitude spike discharges from the left frontotemporoparietal area were seen on electroencephalography but the patient did not present with seizures global developmental delay was noted on the korean infant and child development test performed at age months her gross motor development level was month fine motor months personal social months language months and cognitive adaptive months chromosome analysis showed xx del q fig b fish using an hira q and arsa q probes vysis abbott laboratories abbott park il usa identified the deletion of the arsa gene fig c in addition mlpa analysis using the salsa mlpa p c kit mrc holland amsterdam the netherlands revealed the deletion of the shank gene located on q fig d neither parent had a chromosome analysis at age months the patient could neither hold her head up nor crawl but she could roll over by herself and babble reaching for and grasping an object was not possible global developmental delay was observed in the denver developmental test her personal social development level was months fine motor adaptive months language months and gross motor months currently she is months old and still not able to hold her head up sitting is possible only when her hands are supported she is not able to respond to her name the bayley developmental test demonstrated a cognitive development level of three months language months social months gross motor months and fine motor months a month old male was referred to the outpatient clinic for an evaluation of developmental delays he was born at weeks of gestation with a birth weight of g without perinatal problems there was no family history of congenital anomalies or consanguinity his prenatal evaluation was unremarkable congenital hypothyroidism was diagnosed at age weeks he was admitted to a local hospital due to recurrent respiratory infections at age month at months of age he was not able to control his head or make eye contact with others his weight height and head circumference were kg th th percentile cm th th percentile and cm th percentile respectively he showed facial hypotonia sunset eyes long eyelashes dolicocephaly and relative macrocephaly chest computed tomography was performed due to recurrent respiratory infections and focal narrowing of the mid trachea and left main bronchus between the aorta and pulmonary artery were found in addition flexible bronchoscopy showed tracheomalacia and laryngomalacia there were no cardiac anomalies on echocardiography kidney ultrasonography showed right renal pelviectasis communicating hydrocephalus with interstitial edema of periventricular white matter was observed on a brain mri and this required a ventriculoperitoneal shunt at age months fig a one day after the procedure heart failure and cardiac arrest occurred and the patient subsequently died of multiple organ failure his karyotype was xy r p q while both parents had normal karyotypes fig b deletion of chromosome q was identified by fish pms is a rare disease and its incidence remains elusive facial dysmorphisms such as long eyelashes deep set eyes ptosis prominent dysplastic ears a bulbous nose and a wide nasal bridge may indicate this disease relatively large fleshy hands and hypoplastic or dysplastic toenails of the extremities are also present growth velocity is usually normal or accelerated renal abnormalities or cardiac defects are observed in approximately of cases gastrointestinal symptoms such as feeding difficulties cyclic vomiting and gastroesophageal reflux can be associated with pms neurological manifestations include seizures or aggressive behavior although patients with pms have nonspecific clinical features and diverse clinical courses it is helpful to perform chromosome analysis to evaluate patients with congenital anomalies and developmental delays the size of the deleted region in pms varies widely ranging from a very small deletion of kb to a very large one of over mb however the deletion size is not accurately correlated with the severity of the disease several genes located in the q region such as the shank rab rabl b and ib genes are thought to be related to neurological features the shank gene is located on the distal region to arsa which is known to cause metachromic leukodystrophy the shank protein plays a major role in interlinking between proteins of the postsynaptic membrane and the actin cytoskeleton of the dendritic spine and it is related to synaptic spine maturation mutations in the shank gene is also known to be related to neuropsychiatric conditions such as autism spectrum disorder deletions of the arsa and shank genes were identified using fish and mlpa analysis in the present study only one case of pms has been reported in korea an month old female with hypotonia and developmental delays was diagnosed by chromosome analysis and fish using an arsa probe the patient's karyotype was xx del q and both parents had normal karyotypes brain mri showed a thin corpus callosum and a decreased white matter volume this patient underwent rehabilitation therapy but she was still not able to uphold her head or make eye contact at years table global developmental delay hypotonia and delayed speech were the main clinical features both found in the previous and the present study patient who had terminal deletion of q resulting from ring chromosome showed worse prognosis compared to those who had microdeletion of q region most patients usually have no life threatening organ dysfunction or events however patient in the present study had severe hydrocephalus urgently necessitating immediate intervention in contrast to patient this patient also had an airway anomaly which has not been reported in other cases of pms rehabilitation therapy was applied to increase muscle tone and improve developmental delays although progress was slow obvious enhancement of muscle tone and development was observed in summary this report described the clinical features outcomes and molecular genetic data in cases of pms in korea in the event that hypotonia severe speech delays mildly dysmorphic facial features and multiple congenital anomalies involving the kidneys heart or toenails are present pms should be considered among the possible diagnoses and molecular cytogentic testing should be undertaken for confirmation
 scn a mutation in a child presenting with seizures and developmental delays the scn a gene encodes the sodium voltage gated channel alpha subunit mutations in this gene have been associated with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy type with the use of whole exome sequencing a de novo missense mutation in scn a was identified in a yr old female who initially exhibited symptoms of epilepsy

a proband in which a de novo likely disease contributing mutation in scn a was discovered this study focused on the use of next generation exome sequencing to find mutations by analyzing primarily protein coding regions of the dna the proband is a yr old female presenting with idiopathic epilepsy to seizures per day cortical blindness and developmental regression figs and and supplemental video her medical records show that she has no language or motor skills is fed through a g tube and has recurrent fevers and osteopenia she had acute fractures of her distal radius and distal ulna bilaterally as well as on the left distal tibia and left distal fibula while on a ketogenic diet table outlines her phenotypic features using human phenotype ontology hpo terms before whole exome sequencing wes an infantile epileptic encephalopathy panel that did not include scn a was ordered for this proband the results showed a variant of uncertain significance in exon of the grin a gene that encodes the glutamate ionotropic receptor n methyl d aspartate nmda type subunit a resulting in an amino acid change from phenylalanine to isoleucine at position parents of the proband were tested for this variant and the unaffected father was found to carry this variant this proband had a high resolution whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism snp copy number microarray analysis using the cytoscan hd platform and chromosome analysis suite software affymetrix was used for analysis the result was normal and no clinically significant copy number variants were discovered the only reported complication during pregnancy was a group b streptococcal infection in the mother from birth to mo of age the proband met all milestones although her parents report she was slightly hypotonic at mo she experienced her first seizure like activity although medical tests revealed no abnormalities the evening after her mo vaccinations including diphtheria dt haemophilus influenzae type b hib conjugate prp t inactivated polio vaccine ipv and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine pcv she was admitted to the emergency department with increased seizure activity nystagmus hypotonia and fever although medical tests revealed no pertinent abnormalities a direct link between the vaccination and the onset of symptoms has not been established and a link is not proposed by the authors an electroencephalogram eeg wk after the onset of severe symptoms revealed severe abnormalities and the patient was diagnosed with idiopathic epileptic encephalopathy the eeg showed the presence of frequent independent multifocal mostly right posterior epileptogenic abnormalities consistent with a tendency toward partial onset seizures and this is indicative of right hemispheric profound cerebral dysfunction follow up eegs showed multifocal sharp waves facial features include a short upturned nose full cheeks a short philtrum and a horizontal crease on the chin magnetic resonance imaging mri scans revealed no significant abnormalities that might contribute to the proband's condition myelination was determined to be within normal range and no congenital brain malformations or cytotoxic edema were found to suggest ischemia the only abnormality found was a small left periventricular cyst most likely an incidental germinolytic cyst which was determined to be unrelated to the proband's clinical presentation her physical manifestations include the absence of all mobility and motor coordination with daily placement in a wheelchair and the absence of a startle reflex possibly secondary to neck weakness and poor eye control the family history is unremarkable medications that the proband is now taking include phenobarbital carbamazepine and charlotte's web hemp extract the addition of carbamazepine has stopped her loop seizures and prevents her from having seizures as she enters and exits sleep she has improved awareness has more eye contact and is able to shake a rattle blood samples from the proband as well as blood and saliva samples from parents and siblings were sequenced at affiliated genetics in salt lake city utah where genomic dna was extracted and exons sequenced using the life technologies ampliseq exome rdy kit and the life technologies proton sequencing system see methods these targeted regions were sequenced using the ion proton sequencing system using ion hi q chemistry with bp reads the dna sequence was compared with the university of california santa cruz ucsc hg reference sequence and several methods of analysis were applied to the sequence data see methods a summary of variants called for all individuals in the family are described in table and coverage and mapping statistics are shown in table these analyses included in house protocols and several commercial software packages including tute genomics omicia opal and cartagenia v along with the use of the otg snpcaller pipeline see methods in all analyses we arrived at similar conclusions but the various analyses helped to provide a more comprehensive and in depth approach to the data the omicia results from three quad analyses each with different siblings are shown

one example for the otg snpcaller pipeline the final variant call format vcf file for each individual contained to variants of which to were found to be inherited however to variants were recognized as de novo which is notably above the expected number of de novo mutations found in standard wes bamshad et al kong et al in addition even with an optimized variant calling pipeline there were still a significant number of false positives the number of variants found in the proband was and the mean depth of coverage was fold a gemini query paila et al selected zero autosomal recessive mutations and rare de novo mutations of interest a unique de novo heterozygous variant in the scn a gene on chromosome at position was identified c t c p leu ser table fig a this mutation is not present in any frequency in public databases such as database for short genomic variations dbsnp genomes phase data national heart lung and blood institute nhlbi exomes or exome aggregation consortium exac version which contains allelic information derived from approximately exome sequences the presence of the mutation was confirmed using sanger sequencing following standard procedures fig b this missense mutation has not been previously identified in any other patient with epilepsy leucine is located in transmembrane segment dis of the sodium channel and is highly conserved through evolution the substitution changes the hydrophobic leucine residue to the hydrophilic serine which is likely to alter channel function the combined annotation dependent depletion cadd score was indicating that this substitution is within the of most deleterious mutations percentile the sorting intolerant from tolerant sift ng and henikoff and polymorphism phenotyping polyphen scores adzhubei et al were and respectively also predicting that the mutation is deleterious analyses with phenolyzer yang et al wannovar chang and wang and phenix zemojtel et al all predict that a heterozygous missense mutation in scn a is likely to contribute to the phenotype the output from phenix phenolyzer and wannovar can be viewed in supplemental figures respectively the online mendelian inheritance in man omim database describes early infantile epileptic encephalopathy and cognitive impairment as two phenotypes associated with mutations in scn a because the proband has a similar phenotype this is considered to be a mutation that contributes to the phenotype described here several studies have associated mutations in scn a with epilepsy intellectual disability and cranial features such as microcephaly veeramah et al de kovel et al estacion et al ohba et al vaher et al blanchard et al larsen et al wagnon and meisler overall the various analyses employed herein were able to efficiently and accurately detect variants in this family uncovering a deleterious single nucleotide variant snv likely contributing to the severe phenotype and previously unidentified in clinical databases such as clinvar and omim by using existing databases to filter variants by rarity and deleteriousness common variants and or benign variants can be excluded from the analysis leaving a small subset of variants to study and facilitating the analysis unlike other tools and protocols currently available the described protocol efficiently examines the phenotypes associated with the genic location of a mutation by using phenotype analysis tools to efficiently provide a link between a variant and a set of phenotypes this step prioritizes variants by phenotypic relevance quickly and efficiently thus eliminating the need to manually research the phenotypes associated with many genes wannovar outputs were not depicted here because this relies on phenolyzer to determine relationships to phenotype and was thus similar to the phenolyzer output as in previous studies bragg et al b salipante et al the ion torrent personal genome machine pgm sequencing results appeared to have several erroneous calls especially around homopolymer regions and indels these errors have been attributed to the pgm dark sequencing chemistry which uses semiconductor chips to measure minute ph differences caused by the release of a hydrogen ion when a nucleotide attaches to a dna template in contrast light sequencing platforms such as the illumina miseq and hiseq use high resolution cameras or sensors to detect wavelengths of light emitted when a reaction occurs such as when a fluorescently labeled nucleotide attaches to a prepared dna template even with an optimized variant calling platform the errors in pgm sequencing can lead to high false positive rates it is likely that the high number of de novo mutations most of which have a low quality score were detected by the variant calling pipeline because of the small and sporadic occurrence of sequencing errors in homopolymer regions although several mutations of scn a have been found to be associated with a similar syndrome wagnon and meisler there is no entry in clinvar for the p leu ser mutation interestingly mutation of the corresponding leucine residue in scn a resulted in impaired channel inactivation kahlig et al a common feature of scn a mutations in epileptic encephalopathy wagnon et al although there are several factors leading to a susceptibility to fractures including a ketogenic diet often recommended for seizures bergqvist et al this patient

the iugr and an enlarged cisterna magna observed on routine prenatal ultrasound at birth camptodactyly hypertonia and distinctive facial features were noted a diagnosis occurred at months of age and

investigations performed a molecular diagnosis was also possible with ngs panel testing for epilepsy related genes at age years a pubmed search for reported cases of dyrk a mutations or partial chromosome deletions yielded a total of patients from papers table a summary of the clinical features of the patients and the previously published cases is shown in table we recognize that any conclusions based on published data may enrich for more severe phenotypes however the relatively large number of cases n may attenuate this potential source of bias the age at diagnosis of the patients and those from the literature showed a wide range from months to years the months observed for patient was the earliest reported molecular diagnosis on history disease manifestations were early in most patients and prenatal findings were observed in this included cases of iugr cases of oligohydramnios and case of polyhydramnios birth measurements were commonly in the low range sd though this was not universal in aggregate the most common features were id and developmental delay seen in cases dysmorphic facies in feeding difficulties in and microcephaly sd seen in a number of

cisterna magna observed in our case fig c an additional less commonly seen feature observed in patient was bilateral optic disc pallor anomalies of the optic disc or optic nerve have been seen in other individuals with dyrk a mutations visual abnormalities were seen in of patients including hyperopia myopia strabismus astigmatism exotropia amblyopia and corneal clouding there was also retinal detachment in the oldest individual published in the literature at years dysmorphic features characteristic of a dyrk a mutation were near universal in patients this includes deep set eyes with a hooded appearance to the lateral aspect of the palpebral fissures a prominent nasal root bitemporal narrowing prominent and dysplastic ears hand and or foot abnormalities were also seen in patients that included long tapered fingers small hands and feet th finger clinodactyly toe syndactyly high arched feet and proximal placement of the first toe polydactyly was reported in cases spinal or thoracic abnormalities were seen in patients presenting with pectus excavatum kyphosis scoliosis and abnormal cervical spine seventeen patients were reported to have gastrointestinal symptoms including gastroesophageal reflux disease in patients of whom required a nissen fundoplication recurrent vomiting in patients pyloric stenosis in patients and duodenal atresia in patient our summary of the previously reported cases and our cases highlight relatively rare findings within this group contractures in the digits or lower limbs were seen in our patient fig d as well as others an ataxic gait seen in patient was also described in other individuals there have been cases in the literature that reported recurring or frequent infections cardiac anomalies including ventricular septal defect vsd patent ductus arteriosis pda and aortic valve stenosis or insufficiency were found in cases there were reports of genitourinary findings cryptorchidism in patients unilateral renal agenesis pelvic kidney renal cyst hypospadia micropenis and our patient with bilateral hydronephrosis though these cardiac and renal findings are not seen in the majority of patients with dyrk a mutations they should be considered during monitoring and long term care a schematic representation of the intragenic and de novo dyrk a mutations is shown in fig the dyrk a protein contains a kinase domain spanning from residue other important features in the n terminus include a nuclear localization signal and a dyrk homology box a sequence highly conserved in the dyrk family of unknown function from residue to there is a targeting signal that has been shown to cause localization of the protein to subnuclear compartments associated with splicing machinery the majority of mutations occurred within the kinase domain or in the n terminal nonsense frameshift and splice site mutations of the missense mutations occurred within the kinase domain potentially leading to diminished protein function the only missense mutation falling outside of the functional domain alters the first residue of the speckle targeting signal important for the localization of the dyrk a protein there does not seem to be a clear genotype phenotype correlation with the mutations and the phenotypes reported there were patients with the same nonsense mutation p arg reported by different groups and they did not appear to differ from the majority of cases reported the recurrence of the p arg mutation is likely due to its location in a cpg dinucleotide which are mutation hotspots in summary children with id and syndromic features should be considered for a possible dyrk a mutation testing especially if the recognizable facial features are present growth and feeding issues would also support its potential diagnosis at the time of diagnosis abdominal ultrasound cardiac and ophthalmological assessments would be recommended given the frequency of anomalies genetic counselling would also be recommended in view of the potential for a balanced translocation in a parent with a child carrying microdeletions encompassing dyrk a a recurrence due to possible gonadal mosaicism has yet to be observed routine follow up with a pediatrician would be highly recommended given feeding issues growth and developmental delays

congenital myopathies are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of muscle disorders characterized by congenital or early onset hypotonia and muscle weakness and specific pathological features on muscle biopsy the phenotype ranges from foetal akinesia resulting in in utero or neonatal mortality to milder disorders that are not life limiting over the past decade more than new congenital myopathy genes have been identified most encode proteins involved in muscle contraction however mutations in ion channel encoding genes are increasingly being recognized as a cause of this group of disorders scn a encodes the subunit of the skeletal muscle voltage gated sodium channel na v this channel is essential for the generation and propagation of the muscle action potential

compound heterozygous scn a mutations in a cohort of individuals from six unrelated kindreds with congenital myopathy affected members developed in utero or neonatal onset muscle weakness of variable severity in seven cases severe muscle weakness resulted in death during the third trimester or shortly after birth the remaining four cases had marked congenital or neonatal onset hypotonia and weakness associated with mild to moderate facial and neck weakness significant neonatal onset respiratory and swallowing difficulties and childhood onset spinal deformities all four surviving cohort members experienced clinical improvement in the first decade of life muscle biopsies showed myopathic features including fibre size variability presence of fibrofatty tissue of varying severity without specific structural abnormalities electrophysiology suggested a myopathic process without myotonia in vitro functional assessment in hek cells of the impact of the identified scn a mutations showed loss of function of the mutant na v channels all apart from one of the mutations either caused fully non functional channels or resulted in a reduced channel activity each of the affected cases carried at least one full loss of function mutation in five out of six families a second loss of function mutation was present on the trans allele these functional results provide convincing evidence for the pathogenicity of the identified mutations and suggest that different degrees of loss of function in mutant na v channels are associated with attenuation of the skeletal muscle action potential amplitude to a level insufficient to support normal muscle function the results demonstrate that recessive loss of function scn a mutations should be considered in patients with a congenital myopathy congenital myopathies are a group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous muscle disorders often characterized by specific structural abnormalities in muscle biopsies the degree of severity varies widely from profound muscle weakness leading to in utero or neonatal lethality to less severe infant or childhood onset weakness which results in a much milder clinical course wallgren pettersson and laing common features are prominent facial muscle weakness with or without ptosis and proximal predominant limb muscle weakness congenital myopathies demonstrate a considerable degree of locus and allelic heterogeneity mutations in different genes can cause the same pathology and mutations in the same gene can lead to different types of muscle pathology this indicates that disruption of a common pathway rather than a strict gene pathology relationship determines the disease pathogenesis sewry et al nance et al ravenscroft et al in the past decade whole exome sequencing has contributed to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of congenital myopathies by facilitating the identification of novel disease causing genes and by broadening our understanding of the range of phenotypes associated with known causative genes scn a encodes the subunit of the skeletal muscle voltage gated sodium channel na v mainly expressed in skeletal muscle the tetrodotoxin sensitive na v channel trimmer et al zhou and hoffman is essential for the generation and propagation of the muscle action potential crucial for skeletal muscle contraction na v is a large protein composed of four homologous domains di div each consisting of six transmembrane segments s s segments s and s of each domain form the single ion conducting pore while s s form the voltage sensing domains the four positively charged s segments function as voltage sensors regulating the opening and closing of the pore st hmer et al dominant gain of function mutations in scn a are a well established cause of disorders collectively termed sodium channelopathies the range of phenotypes associated with sodium channelopathies includes episodes of muscle stiffness potassium aggravated myotonia episodes of paralytic attacks associated with reduced serum potassium levels hypokalaemic periodic paralysis or combination of attacks of both myotonia and periodic paralysis in the same patient paramyotonia congenita hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis vicart et al ryan et al corrochano et al attacks can be triggered by changes in temperature or ion concentration and can last from minutes to days in myotonia the mutated na v causes sarcolemmal hyperexcitability and delayed muscle relaxation after contraction while in periodic paralysis a prolonged sodium current hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis or an aberrant gating pore current through na v hypokalaemic periodic paralysis type results in membrane depolarization and inexcitability suetterlin et al neonatal hypotonia with variable feeding and respiratory difficulty has also been rarely reported in the sodium channelopathies this is a transient phenomenon however which improves spontaneously matthews et al recessive loss of function scn a

hours and resulting in muscle fatigue later in life arnold et al a homozygous missense mutation in scn a was identified in this patient while the heterozygous parents were asymptomatic in both patients the mutant na v channels had enhanced fast inactivation constituting a loss of function effect here we describe homozygous or compound heterozygous scn a mutations in individuals from six unrelated families with congenital myopathy the affected cases had clinical phenotypes ranging from severe foetal hypokinesia resulting in early lethality to classical' congenital myopathy that

phenotype in four surviving individuals phenotypic features of the cohort are summarized in table and clinical data are detailed in supplementary table clinical and muscle mri images are shown in fig the most salient clinical features are described below in utero history the seven most severely affected cohort members developed marked foetal hypokinesia from to weeks gestation all seven also developed in utero onset limb contractures and or talipes which were first detected at to weeks talipes was the most common limb deformity seen on ultrasound in severely affected infants first detected between to weeks additional lower limb joint contractures were noted prior to delivery in five of the infants in utero onset upper limb and or finger contractures were detected on ultrasound in four cases sometimes in combination with lower limb contractures three cases almost all severely affected cohort members also developed features suggestive of hydrops present in evident from to weeks the mothers of all seven severely affected cohort members developed polyhydramnios onset to weeks which typically developed in parallel with hypokinesia and foetal limb contractures decompression procedures to reduce liquor volume were required in two cases prematurity and early death one severely affected infant was born at term but died at h of age from respiratory complications the other six severely affected infants died at or before weeks gestation two infants died spontaneously prior to delivery at and weeks gestation one died during delivery at weeks two died within h of their premature delivery due to severe respiratory insufficiency at and weeks and one pregnancy was terminated at weeks gestation due to recurrence of features seen in two severely affected pregnancies all seven cohort members who did not survive beyond the first day of life had at least one sign of in utero involvement e g hypokinesia limb contractures or talipes by weeks gestation and in cases at least one abnormality was evident by weeks external examination and autopsy findings external examination was undertaken in all seven infants who died prematurely or at term six also underwent autopsy marked muscle hypoplasia was present in all seven hydrops was confirmed in six cases external and autopsy examination revealed features associated with hydrops e g pericardial and pleural effusions ascites and or hepatomegaly in addition to the features associated with severe foetal hypokinesia a small thorax pulmonary hypoplasia limb contractures and fractures in addition to talipes present in cases four had lower limb contractures typically bilateral hip flexion contractures with or without additional external rotation and knee extension contractures five had upper limb contractures finger flexion in wrist elbow flexion shoulder flexion in general lower limb contractures were more marked than upper limb contractures limb fractures were present in cases left humerus and right mid femur thin gracile ribs and or thin long bones were noted in at least cases several infants had additional facial features that were not shared by other family members this included plagiocephaly frontal bossing deep set eyes cases downward sloping lateral orbital ridges a flattened nose ear abnormalities retrognathia and or micrognathia and or a small triangular or tented mouth a subset of these e g multiple joint contractures hydrops oedema pulmonary hypoplasia and retromicrognathia are well known features of foetal akinesia deformation sequence ravenscroft et al the four surviving cohort members are currently aged and years and all have features consistent with classical' congenital myopathy in utero and birth history pregnancy records were available for three of the four surviving cohort members with limited data available for the fourth in utero features were generally less marked than in severe foetal hypokinesia cases however at least one abnormality hypokinesia polyhydramnios or talipes was present in three of the four cases foetal hypokinesia was noted during the pregnancies of two of the four surviving cohort members onset at and weeks respectively but appears to have been less marked than in more severely affected cohort members polyhydramnios complicated the pregnancies of surviving cohort members and was first noted slightly later to weeks none of the surviving cohort members had limb contractures or talipes detected on prenatal ultrasound or a history of hydrops all four were born at or close to term breech presentation or transverse lie complicated delivery of three of these four affected individuals one required resuscitation following delivery congenital features all four surviving cohort members had moderate to severe hypotonia and facial neck axial and limb weakness which was either present at birth or developed within the first few days of life as was the case for the proband from family a weak cry a generalized reduction in muscle bulk and reduced or absent limb reflexes were also each noted in two or more surviving infants talipes was present in only one of the four and this was not detected until delivery another child had mild bilateral hip contractures first noted at birth which resolved with stretching exercises bulbar involvement swallowing difficulties severe enough to warrant supplemental tube and or parenteral gastrostomy peg feeding were present from birth in surviving cohort members reliance on supplemental feeding typically declined over time and ceased during infancy or early childhood the two youngest cohort members now aged and years have evidence of persisting oromotor weakness and expressive language delay suggestive of ongoing bulbar involvement however both have experienced improvement in their feeding and language status over time pattern of muscle involvement and contractures all surviving cohort members had mild to moderate upper and lower limb weakness which was typically more marked proximally cases hip extension and abduction were the weakest manoeuvres in cases neck weakness was universal and typically more pronounced than limb weakness neck flexion was usually weaker than extension shoulder neck and truncal muscle atrophy was often more marked than limb muscle atrophy muscle hypertrophy muscle pain and fasciculations were not present in any cohort member postnatal onset lower limb contractures were noted in only surviving cohort member abnormal foot positioning was noted in pes planus in hindfoot valgus forefoot pronation deformities in progression in axial weakness was documented in at least one surviving cohort member this resulted in the development of respiratory insufficiency severe enough to warrant institution of non invasive nocturnal ventilation at age years two of the four surviving cohort members needed non invasive respiratory support at or soon after birth and a third required invasive ventilation the duration of support varied however two were weaned from respiratory intervention by the age of years the third remains reliant on nocturnal bipap bilevel positive airway pressure at age postnatal onset scoliosis kyphosis and spinal rigidity each were also reported in at least one additional case facial and eye involvement mild to moderate facial weakness and myopathic facial features including an elongated face and or a high arched palate were present in all four cases fig additional dysmorphisms noted in at least included dolichocephaly synophrys proptosis large down slanting palpebral fissures and a broad nasal root and bridge a subset of the dysmorphic facial features noted in cohort members with severe foetal hypokinesia including deep set eyes frontal bossing and micrognathia were present in at least one surviving individual mild weakness of up gaze developed in one child at age years generalized ophthalmoplegia was noted in a second affected individual ptosis was not present in any cohort member functional abilities delay in early motor milestones was universal age when independent ambulation was first achieved ranged from months to years months at least two cohort members were eventually able to run albeit slowly and with difficulty gait was typically broad based slow and waddling two of four used assistive devices splints and or frame and used a wheelchair at least two cohort members had additional fine motor delay all four experienced clearly documented improvements in strength and motor skills over time all three that achieved independent ambulation remain able to walk the youngest years old member is making good progress towards walking independently additional features other features noted in two or more affected individuals included chest wall deformities generalized joint hypermobility at least unilateral or bilateral scapular winging one case each fig one surviving cohort member had tricuspid insufficiency at birth which resolved with time no cardiac defects were present in the other three individuals and none have developed additional cardiac complications over time intermittent exacerbations in muscle weakness and increased fatigability marked fatigability with walking and or writing was a feature in at least of the surviving cohort members the proband from family carrying heterozygous p r c who is now years of age began to experience exercise and illness associated exacerbations in her level of muscle weakness from the age of and an activity limiting increase in her fatigability from age these episodes can last a few minutes and while they could be considered reminiscent of periodic paralysis her repetitive stimulation and single fibre emg results were normal with no evidence of alteration of the amplitude or the total area of the compound muscle action potential during exercise test performed after cooling or after a long exercise test the oldest cohort member now aged has experienced a deterioration in her strength and motor abilities and increase in fatigability over the past years she also has an abnormal repetitive stimulation test result suggestive of an additional neuromuscular junction abnormality table which may be contributing to her fatigability one of her mutations was reported previously in a family with autosomal dominant non dystrophic myotonia lee et al however myotonia was notably absent in this and all other cohort members status of confirmed carriers segregation studies confirmed that all parents and one unaffected sibling from family were carriers of one scn a mutation eight parents from families and and the sibling carrier were examined by an experienced neurologist and or clinical geneticist and showed no evidence of myopathy myotonia or other abnormal neurological features this included the paternal carrier of p r c mutation previously reported in an unusual recessive form of hypokalaemic periodic paralysis the remaining four parents were unavailable for formal examination but by report had no neurological symptoms or signs this included the maternal carrier of the p r w mutation previously reported in dominant non dystrophic myotonia investigations performed in the cohort members are summarized in table the creatine kinase level was normal u l in all four surviving cohort members neurophysiology testing was undertaken in all four cohort members who survived infancy emg findings were normal in mild abnormalities were present in in patient ii from family there were widespread myopathic changes in all four limbs at age months however on repeat testing at age years all abnormalities had normalized in parallel with a gradual improvement in strength and motor abilities single fibre emg was normal in one cohort member repetitive stimulation testing was undertaken in two cohort members neither had a positive decrement at hz in the oldest cohort member there was however a decrement at hz nerve conduction velocities were normal in members testing undertaken in the oldest cohort member at age years showed reduced motor amplitudes the fourth surviving cohort member had sensory conduction abnormalities at age days and months but these had normalized by years of age muscle spinal and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging lower limb muscle mri was undertaken in patients ii family at age years and ii family at age years fig both patients had severe involvement of the glutei marked bilateral symmetric involvement of sartorius adductor magnus and soleus spinal mri was undertaken in one cohort member and showed a scoliosis and erector spinae muscle atrophy but a normal spinal cord cerebral mri was performed in two cohort members one at days the other at months of age and was normal in both post mortem muscle samples were taken from all foetal hypokinesia affected cohort members patient ii family gestational age family patient ii patient ii and patient ii and family patient ii patient ii and patient ii muscle histopathology findings included abnormal fibre size variation with a mixture of small and large fibres across fascicles without overt grouping presence of fibrofatty tissue which was particularly severe in patient ii family was noted in all cases fig a c necrosis and regeneration were not seen rods other inclusions cores or other structural abnormalities were absent fig quadriceps muscle biopsies taken from the congenital myopathy cohort members showed milder myopathic features fig a combination of slow fibre hypotrophy with normal to larger sized fast fibres and mild slow predominance was seen in patient ii family no overt structural abnormalities or nemaline rods were present fig where fibre typing data were available muscle samples in the foetal hypokinesia cohort showed fast predominance probably related to immaturity while mild to marked slow predominance was observed in the biopsies from the congenital myopathy cohort the truncating mutations p q x and p y x would delete and amino acids respectively from the c terminal end of the na v protein they would result in nonsense mediated decay of the scn a transcript or if translated in non functional channels to investigate the effect of the c a c mutation on scn a mrna splicing we performed reverse transcription pcr in peripheral blood cells from the proband mother and father from family using primers flanking exon two distinct fragments were amplified a smaller fragment was obtained in all three samples while a larger fragment was only present in the index case and the father sanger sequencing demonstrated the smaller to be a bp fragment corresponding to the wild type scn a transcript of exons the larger bp fragment contained exons and an additional bp of intron supplementary fig the retained intron sequence introduces a stop codon in the scn a mrna coding sequence at amino acid position p a vfsx that would generate a truncated na v protein the deletion of c terminal amino acids is predicted to induce complete loss of na v channel function the frameshift p h qfs located at the channel c terminus caused by c duplication generates a protein that is nine amino acids longer than the wild type the mutated channels would have c terminal sequence that is completely altered compared to wild type channels the effect of c terminus frameshift mutations is largely unknown and therefore p h qfs was included in the functional analyses three of the variants p r h p p t and p c f did not display any detectable sodium currents when expressed in hek cells n fig suggesting that they render the channel completely non functional variants p m k p r w and p d n displayed currents with reduced amplitude p for m k and r w p for d n the voltage dependence of channel activation for these three variants was shifted to depolarizing direction p fig and table the data clearly demonstrate that the function of these channels is impaired the loss of function effects of the p d n mutation were confirmed in an alternate heterologous expression system chinese hamster ovary cho cells data not shown the frameshift variant p h qfs did not display any loss of na v channel function properties upon heterologous expression neither the peak current density the voltage dependencies of the channel activation fast or slow inactivation nor the time courses of onset or recovery from fast inactivation were significantly different from wild type channels fig table supplementary fig and supplementary table in addition to impaired channel activation the voltage dependence of fast inactivation was shifted to depolarizing direction for p d n p and p m k p variants fig and table some substitutions also displayed a statistically significant change in the voltage dependence of slow inactivation or in the kinetics of fast inactivation analysis of these data is shown in supplementary fig and supplementary table the p r c channel has been comprehensively characterized groome et al it causes loss of channel function by enhancing fast inactivation of the channel in addition it causes gating pore currents which are typical for hypokalaemic periodic paralysis mutant channel we studied the gating pore currents of the p r c channels using x laevis oocyte expression system we found that the gating pore current of the rat na v r c orthologue is active at hyperpolarized resting voltages even when the holding voltage is hyperpolarized supplementary fig this differs from previous studies groome et al that detected the hyperpolarization activated gating pore currents only after a depolarizing prepulse using whole exome sequencing we ascertained a cohort of individuals from six unrelated and ethnically distinct kindreds with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in scn a affected individuals presented with congenital myopathy of variable severity all had in utero or neonatal onset muscle weakness resulting in reduced foetal movements patients at the severe end of the spectrum had clinical features associated with foetal hypokinesia maternal polyhydramnios in utero upper lower limb contractures talipes and hydrops resulting in intrauterine or early postnatal death the patients at the less severe end of the spectrum presented with generalized hypotonia and weakness at birth or within the first few days of life this was typically associated with mild to moderate facial muscle weakness without ptosis and significant early respiratory and feeding difficulties surviving individuals had delayed motor milestones and achieved independent ambulation before the age of years consistent with many forms of classical' congenital myopathy all cohort members who survived infancy experienced improvement in their strength and motor skills over time and concomitant resolution of early respiratory and feeding difficulties the phenotype of the cohort members described in this study differs from that of other sodium channelopathies e g autosomal dominant myotonia and autosomal dominant periodic paralysis and from the two reported scn a related congenital myasthenia cases in stark contrast to other sodium channelopathies the congenital myopathy cohort members had in utero or neonatal onset permanent muscle weakness rather than later onset episodic muscle weakness although individuals with periodic paralysis and in rare instances paramyotonia congenita sometimes develop permanent proximal muscle weakness suetterlin et al this is typically a late complication of the condition and not a presenting feature in addition none of the patients had the typical features of weakness aggravated by specific factors cold special food and exercise that trigger a worsening of stiffness and or weakness in scn a related myotonia or periodic paralysis cannon while in one teenaged patient excessive muscle activity was associated with marked increase in fatigue detailed electrophysiology examination failed to demonstrate neuromuscular junction defects or aspects evocative of periodic paralysis other characteristic features of our patient cohort were the association with abnormal muscle histopathological features and a selective pattern of muscle involvement on muscle mri the majority of scn a mutations associated with periodic paralysis and myotonia are dominantly inherited and cause gain of function predominantly by enhancing channel activation attenuating fast inactivation or by inducing gating pore currents mild enhancement of fast inactivation leading to a loss of function effect has been reported for some na v mutations in hypokalaemic periodic paralysis thus far there are only two reports of loss of na v channel function and recessive inheritance of scn a mutations in congenital myasthenic syndrome tsujino et al arnold et al the loss of function effects were caused by enhanced fast inactivation in both cases in this study we establish that recessive scn a loss of function mutations are the underlying pathomechanism in patients affected by a novel form of congenital myopathy all parents and one unaffected sibling were confirmed to be carriers of one scn a mutation but were unaffected clinically based on formal examination in nine cases and on history and verbal report in the other four the absence of clinical findings in confirmed carriers suggests that the loss of function in only one allele is insufficient to cause a clinical phenotype and further suggest an autosomal recessive mechanism of inheritance the inheritance of full loss of function mutations on both alleles appears to cause a particularly severe phenotype resulting in early lethality evidenced by the homozygous p p t mutation detected in the three affected individuals from family this suggests that muscles without functional na v channels are unable to support life the remaining cohort members carried compound heterozygous scn a mutations all had one mutation that resulted in a completely non functional channel either as a consequence of na v protein truncation or as a result of a mutation that led to a complete abolition of the sodium flux through the channel p r h p c f p q x p a vfsx p y x in families and respectively affected individuals from four of the five families with compound heterozygous mutations had a second mutation in the trans allele which resulted in partial na v loss of function mainly by attenuating channel activation p r w p d n and p m k families and respectively or by enhancing channel inactivation p r c family in family there were no detectable loss of function properties in hek cells for one of the na v variants discussed below some of the affected individuals with compound heterozygous mutations families and also died in utero or at birth implying that some combinations of complete loss of function partial loss of function mutations also result in a severe clinical phenotype interfamilial variability was however also clearly evident this is best demonstrated in family where one affected infant developed severe in utero onset hypokinesia and died within a few hours of birth the other affected infant survived infancy albeit with significant feeding and respiratory support she is now years of age has a phenotype consistent with classical' congenital myopathy and continues to improve clinically over time a feature often associated with classical' congenital myopathies further studies in a large cohort of patients are required to delineate more precise correlation of functional and clinical expression of scn a mutations one of the mutations present in the year old male cohort member from family p h qfs did not result in loss of channel function when studied in hek cells this child has a similar clinical phenotype to other cohort members he was born following a pregnancy complicated by polyhydramnios first noted at delivery had marked neonatal onset weakness and hypotonia associated with facial weakness required significant feeding and respiratory support from birth but continues to improve clinically the frameshift mutation is predicted to alter the c terminal of the protein and extends it by nine residues compared to the wild type channel our analysis suggests that in hek cells na v channel c terminus has no detectable effects on the biophysical properties of the channel this is in agreement with previous data showing that a deletion of the c terminal residues has no effect on channel gating herzog et al however it is possible that the frameshift mutation disrupts channel function in a tissue specific manner which cannot be detected in a heterologous expression system or it might cause loss of function effect not elicited by the functional analyses undertaken in this study for example the last five c terminal amino acid residues play an important role in the interaction of na v with the pdz domain of syntrophin schultz et al a scaffold protein that is a part of the dystrophin associated protein complex and has a vital role in the maintenance of muscle integrity ehmsen et al alterations of the sequence of the c terminus may also disrupt signals responsible for channel trafficking targeting activity or stability additional studies are required to further investigate these possibilities interestingly we identified compound heterozygosity for p r c and a full loss of function mutation in a year old girl with a classical' congenital myopathy phenotype homozygous p r c has been previously described in a patient with an unusual recessive form of hypokalaemic periodic paralysis groome et al consistent for periodic paralysis the mutant channels display gating pore currents the mutation also causes loss of function effects on the main pore current by enhancing fast inactivation which results in reduced channel availability however the heterozygous carrier of this mutation in our family had no periodic weakness furthermore the muscle weakness of the proband carrying a heterozygous p r c and a full loss of function scn a mutation in trans has been permanent rather that periodic suggesting that the reduced main pore sodium current is the likely pathomechanism of the myopathy although this patient who is now years old has started to complain of recurrent brief episodes of increased muscle weakness a detailed electrophysiological study failed to identify any abnormalities typical of periodic paralysis myotonia or neuromuscular junction abnormalities but only demonstrated myopathic features our findings are in agreement with na v being the main skeletal muscle voltage gated sodium channel isoform including the foetal and neonatal muscle critical to muscle function zhou and hoffman expression of a second isoform na v which is tetrodotoxin resistant has been shown in developing and denervated muscle harris and thesleff weiss and horn the tetrodotoxin resistant sodium current may be able to generate action potentials in muscle of newborn rats harris and marshall however these action potentials are defective and disappear soon after birth confirming a key role for tetrodotoxin sensitive currents in generating skeletal muscle action potentials possible differences in na v expression in foetal muscle may however contribute to the variable clinical presentation in the myopathy cohort no mutations in our cohort were detected in scn a that encodes na v the principal sodium channel responsible for the initiation of the cardiac action potential george et al this is consistent with the lack of cardiac involvement in the cohort members in conclusion we have identified homozygous or compound heterozygous recessive mutations in scn a in six congenital myopathy families at least one of the mutations in each patient renders the na v channel fully non functional the mutation on the second allele resulted in full or partial loss of na v channel function in five out of six families this constitutes the first report describing full loss of function scn a mutations as associated with a clinical phenotype the na v channel is crucial for the initiation and propagation of the muscle action potential the link between the depolarization of the membrane and the ca release triggering the muscle contraction is mediated by the interaction between the voltage sensing dhpr and the ca release channel ryr main components of the excitation contraction coupling mutations in ryr are an established cause of several types of congenital myopathy zhang et al jungbluth et al monnier et al here we propose that the combined effects of two loss of function mutant na v channels one of which is a full loss of function attenuates the action potential amplitude in skeletal muscle to a level insufficient to sustain normal muscle force these findings have important implications for genetic diagnosis as they confirm a new form of recessive scn a related congenital myopathy a discovery which will undoubtedly result in improved genetic diagnosis rates in patients with this group of disorders furthermore this study indicates that scn a is another example of a growing number of genes encoding for ion channels recently found to be involved in congenital myopathies our study also opens research avenues aimed at improving the therapeutic management of these patients
 de novo heterozygous loss of function mutations in syngap cause a syndromic form of intellectual disability de novo mutations dnm in syngap encoding ras rap gtpase activating protein syngap have been reported in individuals with nonsyndromic intellectual disability id we identified previously unreported individuals with syngap dnm seven via the deciphering developmental disorders ddd study one through clinical analysis for copy number variation and the remaining two monozygotic twins via a research multi gene panel analysis seven of the nine heterozygous mutations are likely to result in loss of function nonsense frameshift whole gene deletion the remaining two mutations one of which affected the monozygotic twins were missense variants each individual carrying a dnm in syngap had moderate to severe id and had epilepsy typically myoclonic seizures absences or drop attacks had hypotonia had significant constipation had wide based unsteady gait had strabismus and had significant hip dysplasia a proportion of the affected individuals had a similar myopathic facial appearance with broad nasal bridge relatively long nose and full lower lip vermilion a distinctive behavioral phenotype was also observed with aggressive challenging behavior and significant sleep problems being common individuals had mr imaging of the brain each of which was reported as normal the clinical

involving syngap and one with a de novo apparently balanced reciprocal translocation in which one of the breakpoints disrupts syngap krepischi et al pinto et al klitten et al zollino et al writzl and

unreported individuals with de novo mutations in syngap most of whom were diagnosed using trio exome sequencing of individuals with undiagnosed developmental disorders the relatively consistent pattern of clinical features and behavioral anomalies observed in these individuals and in previously reported individuals suggests that there is an emerging syngap associated syndrome seven of the affected individuals were recruited via uk nhs regional genetics services to the deciphering developmental disorders ddd study www ddduk org the eighth individual table i was identified as part of routine investigation of id via a uk nhs paediatric genetics clinic these eight individuals were seen by the same paediatric geneticist mjp in addition to the referring clinical geneticists the ninth

clinical and molecular findings the supporting information online provides additional clinical details for the seven individuals identified via the ddd study trio based exome sequencing was performed on the affected individual and their parents as previously described wright et al each affected individual has also had a high resolution analysis for copy number abnormalities using array based

affected individuals postnatal growth was normal in five individuals and table i three of had mild microcephaly z score between and with one of these also having weight on a similar centile table i two individuals had significant short stature patients and table i one of whom was also significantly underweight patient table i global delay in developmental milestones was present in all patients with an unusual temporal sequence seen in some patients for example patient table i did not sit unaided until months but walked unaided at months typically independent walking was achieved in the third year of life with the subsequent gait being wide based and unsteady language acquisition was highly variable within this group expressive language was delayed with most children using a limited vocabulary of single words none of the affected individuals were toilet trained at the time of assessment seven of the ten individuals showed general hyperexcitability and aggressive behavior often directed towards others a disturbed sleep pattern was reported in all patients with almost all being treated with or having had a therapeutic trial of melatonin anecdotally families reported a high pain threshold and hyperacusis in some affected individuals seven of the individuals had seizures most commonly complex and generalized including myoclonic drop attacks and absences congenital central hypotonia was common most of the affected individuals required ankle splints and or piedro boots to aid with walking seven individuals have had mr imaging of their brains and in each patient this was reported as normal the facial appearance of the ten affected individuals is shown in figure figure the most common shared facial characteristics are almond shaped palpebral fissures which slant downwards slightly all but one had a mildly myopathic appearance an open mouthed appearance with a relatively full lower lip vermilion was common as was a low hanging columella had relatively long noses sometimes with under development of the ala nasi had relatively long ears with protuberant lobes had relatively deep set eyes and one had a degree of ptosis there was no obvious difference in facial appearance between the deletion and intragenic mutation patients five of the individuals had constipation requiring medical therapies three individuals had fine hirsutism especially noticeable over limbs and spine two had significant hip dysplasia requiring surgical management three had a kyphosis or kyphoscoliosis and one had a pectus excavatum table i syngap was originally reported as causing non syndromal intellectual disability hamdan et al supplementary table i summarizes the available clinical data on the individuals who have been reported to date with presumed causative mutations in syngap or deletions or translocations involving this gene hamdan et al a b krepischi et al pinto et al vissers et al cook klitten et al zollino et al clement et al de ligt et al rauch et al berryer et al carvill et al writzl and knegt dyment et al o'roak et al redin et al de novo mutations in this gene are undoubtedly a significant cause of intellectual disability accounting for of all the patients in the ddd study wright et al and major contributors to other cohorts that have been studied supplementary table ii the original designation of the phenotype associated with syngap haploinsufficiency as non syndromal is understandable given the generally normal antenatal growth parameters and the relative normality of post natal growth in addition all patients have a moderate to severe intellectual disability with few structural anomalies reported on brain imaging the genomic pathology is also remarkably consistent with almost all patients having heterozygous de novo loss of function mutations the associated genetic mechanism is very likely to be haploinsufficiency given the similarity of the intragenic mutations with the whole gene deletions although there is wide variability in the type and severity of the clinical features associated with syngap haploinsufficiency some aspects of the phenotype show a level of consistency that suggests syngap haploinsufficiency may be associated with a clinically recognizable syndrome the seizure type and the behavioral phenotype were relatively consistent in our cohort myoclonic absence and drop attack seizures are typical both in the reported individuals and those presented in this paper general hyperexcitability sleep disturbance and aggressive behavior often directed towards others are common features in our cohort and are mentioned in some of the previously reported patients clearly these distressing behavioral components of the phenotype require further investigation facial photographs were not available in most of the previous reports but in the cohort presented here a subtle but consistent facial appearance is suggested although further observations will be required to determine if this is in any way discriminative the pattern of growth may also be helpful in making a clinical diagnosis six of reported patients with postnatal head circumferences recorded and of the patients reported here had measurements of two standard deviations below the mean for their age a mild postnatal microcephaly is clearly over represented in this group in our cohort patients had previously been investigated for angelman syndrome there are some similarities with this condition although we believe that they are clinically distinguishable nevertheless we believe that syngap should also be added to the expanding list of differential diagnoses for angelman syndrome or patients presenting with angelman like features syngap has previously been described as presenting in a non syndromal manner mutations in this gene have been found to be a relatively common cause of intellectual disability in large scale massively parallel sequencing studies where subjects are usually recruited because a clinical syndromal diagnosis has not previously been made it is arguable whether the term non specific may be more appropriate to many subjects recruited into such studies who most likely represent a heterogeneous mix of those genuinely non syndromal but also of some syndromes more subtle in their associations and or dysmorphology for syngap we consider discriminative features in individuals with moderate to severe id to be the characteristic facial features seizure type and behavioral phenotype generalized hyper excitability sleep disturbance and a propensity to aggression it is not yet clear if hypotonia hip dysplasia strabismus wide based unsteady gait fine hirsutism limbs and spine and significant constipation are helpful discriminators some patients have microcephaly but growth parameters are generally within the normal range
 pogz truncating alleles cause syndromic intellectual disability large scale cohort based whole exome sequencing of individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders ndds has identified numerous novel candidate disease genes however detailed phenotypic information is often lacking in such studies de novo mutations in pogo transposable element with zinc finger domain pogz have been identified in six independent and diverse cohorts of individuals with ndds ranging from autism spectrum disorder to developmental delay whole exome sequencing was performed on five unrelated individuals sanger sequencing was used to validate variants and segregate mutations with the phenotype in available family members we identified heterozygous truncating mutations in pogz in five unrelated individuals which were confirmed to be de novo or not present in available parental samples careful review of the phenotypes revealed shared features that included developmental delay intellectual disability hypotonia behavioral abnormalities and similar facial characteristics variable features included short stature microcephaly strabismus and hearing loss while pogz has been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders in large cohort studies our data suggest that loss of function variants in pogz lead to an identifiable syndrome of ndd with specific phenotypic traits this study exemplifies the era of human reverse clinical genomics ushered in by large disease directed cohort studies first defining a new syndrome molecularly and only subsequently phenotypically neurodevelopmental disorders ndds reflect a molecularly and phenotypically heterogeneous classification encompassing intellectual disability id microcephaly and neurobehavioral traits such as autism spectrum disorder asd collectively these traits are quite common with asd having a prevalence of and id occurring in of the population the delineation of various ndds is not discrete as more than one phenotype is often present in an individual whole exome sequencing wes has revealed that mutations in the same gene may be associated with a broad spectrum of neurobehavioral and neurodevelopmental phenotypes the clinical and genetic heterogeneity of asd and other neurobehavioral traits represents a challenge for both molecular diagnoses and new gene discovery asd is characterized by impairment in social interaction as well as restricted and stereotyped patterns of interest and activities and is often accompanied by id and language delay recent advances in personal genome analysis and the assembly of large cohorts for study have begun to identify potentially pathogenic variants in individuals with asd however the majority of asd loci have yet to be identified and may include gene regulatory mechanisms such as epigenetic modifications and noncoding rnas there is emerging evidence for shared genomic underpinnings and genetic etiologies of neuropsychiatric disorders including asd schizophrenia and id as evidenced by both wes studies and the mirror trait manifestations of some copy number variants cnvs the over representation of de novo mutations in affected individuals illustrates the strong genetic basis for ndds the prevalence of de novo cnvs has been extensively explored during the past decade with a large proportion of asd cases containing these events moreover cognitive phenotypes have been tied to cnv in population cohorts however despite the known molecular etiology for of cases the genetic etiology in the majority of individuals with asd is presently unable to be identified genomic approaches to diagnosis include array comparative genomic hybridization acgh whole genome sequencing wgs and wes these approaches have identified the genetic etiology of many diverse mendelian diseases recently large scale wes studies have been conducted on a number of ndd cohorts these studies have identified many likely pathogenic single nucleotide variants resulting in the generation of candidate gene lists for neurodevelopmental traits however the large number of individuals in cohort publications precludes the reporting of detailed clinical information for each case and often diagnostically relevant dysmorphology is not recognized until a cohort of individuals with a shared genetic etiology is assembled premature truncating mutations in pogo transposable element with zinc finger domain or pogz mim have been implicated by wes in three asd cohort studies cohorts examining developmental delay dd and id and one schizophrenia cohort additionally a recently published case report details a missense pogz mutation present in an individual with microcephaly asd id and other clinical features the recurrent identification of pogz in these studies has robustly implicated pogz in diverse ndds yet no thorough clinical analysis for pogz variant associated phenotypic features has been published to date although relatively little is known about the function of pogz a recent study detailed the interaction of the zinc finger domain of pogz with hp and the resultant activation of aurora b kinase therefore pogz likely plays a role in mitotic progression through heterochromatin formation and chromosomal segregation and may also influence gene expression these functions of pogz are consistent with the presence of deleterious variants in patients with microcephaly and other neurodevelopmental phenotypes we have identified five pogz disrupting mutations in patients with diverse clinical assessments these individuals have variable ndds with shared features comprising id global dd behavioral abnormalities microcephaly short stature strabismus and shared facial characteristics together with eight pathogenic mutations from the literature we describe the spectrum of phenotypes in individuals with deleterious mutations in pogz ascertainment of patients with a shared molecular diagnosis and subsequent phenotypic characterization delineates the clinical presentation common to individuals with pogz mutations this genotype driven approach may be especially relevant for the variable presentations of ndds and can be used to further clinically characterize candidate genes identified in diverse cohort studies this study conforms to the helsinki declaration and was performed with approval by the baylor college of medicine institutional review board protocol number h for all sequencing conducted at the baylor college of medicine human sequencing center written informed consent was obtained from the parents legal guardians of the patients for publication of this research and any accompanying images exome sequence analysis across all sequencing centers followed the guidelines and process for classifying sequencing variants developed by the american college of medical genetics and genomics trio based sequencing allowed for the prioritization of de novo loss of function mutations in four patients an average of de novo mutations were identified in each proband of which pogz was the only truncating allele additionally variants in pogz were selected for confirmation and co segregation with the phenotype because loss of function mutations in this gene have been found in large cohorts of individuals with neuropsychiatric phenotypes all identified variants in pogz have been deposited into clinvar under accession numbers scv scv scv scv and scv in agreement with institutional review board approval and patient consent dna from patient and her mother was subjected to wes at the bcm human genome sequencing center through the baylor hopkins center for mendelian genomics initiative exome sequencing and analysis were performed according to previously described methods potential de novo mutations were identified in silico by subtracting variants observed in the mother from those observed in patient candidate variants were filtered against exome data in publicly available databases

mammalian evolution however the variant was inherited from her father who had a history of learning disability and a personality disorder and is shared with her sister who had clinical features suggestive of smith magenis syndrome thus we could not conclusively rule out that this missense variant in rai is contributing to the phenotype present in patient but her more severe developmental

complex partial seizures localizing to the left frontoparietal area he was initially treated with phenobarbital but switched to levetiracetam and was well controlled due to concern that this drug was contributing to his behavioral issues the patient was switched to oxcarbazepine he developed tic like movements after the second dose and it was stopped topiramate was added and he did start having new seizures while he was on both topiramate and levetiracetam but controlled with higher doses of topiramate levetiracetam was eventually weaned and the irritability has improved previous work up was unrevealing and included chromosome analysis acgh metabolic testing angelman methylation studies and crebbp and ep testing for rubinstein taybi syndrome i and ii patient is a year old female with microcephaly short stature global dd and a history of low muscle tone additional medical concerns included feeding difficulties severe gastroesophageal reflux disease sensorineural hearing loss exotropia and obstructive sleep apnea facial characteristics included brachycephaly a sloping broad forehead posteriorly rotated ears upslanting palpebral fissures long and flat malar region broad and depressed nasal tip short philtrum downturned corners of the mouth high palate pointed chin and relative prognathia ophthalmology exam showed exotropia anisometropia optic nerve hypoplasia and rod cone retinal dystrophy brain mri showed optic nerve hypoplasia with no other structural abnormalities skeletal survey was normal other than significant brachycephaly at age months she underwent a developmental assessment according to both the clinical and auditory milestones scale and cognitive adaptive test she scored at a basal level of months indicating severe delays across all areas of development with most significant delays to her acquisition of speech and language previous molecular testing included acgh which revealed a paternally inherited kb copy number gain within chromosome q she had a normal chromosome analysis an unrevealing targeted microcephaly gene panel and normal thyroid function studies plasma amino acids urine organic acids and urine mucopolysaccharides patient is a year month old female with microcephaly cleft palate global dd hypotonia and asd she presented at birth with cleft palate micrognathia and a duplicated renal collecting system facial and physical characteristics included broad forehead brachycephaly broad and depressed nasal tip short philtrum thin vermillion border downturned corners of the mouth pointed chin and small hands with relative brachydactyly upon her initial clinical presentation additional features were noted including auditory neuropathy immune deficiency and left duplicated renal collecting system ophthalmology exam showed exotropia astigmatism and small optic nerves brain mri revealed dandy walker variant decreased white matter and enlarged third and fourth ventricles her original exome report identified compound heterozygous variants of unknown clinical significance in stil associated with primary microcephaly additionally microarray revealed a paternally inherited xq duplication previous normal testing included chromosome analysis fish for q deletion methylation studies for prader willi and angelman syndromes and ror sequencing other testing all normal included urine organic acids serum amino acids acylcarnitine and very long chain fatty acids the clinical description of the individuals in this study overlaps with the descriptions of previously reported patients all five subjects had global dd and or id behavioral abnormalities ranged from self injurious behavior to high functioning asd additional common features included microcephaly stature below the tenth percentile hypotonia strabismus vision abnormalities sensorineural hearing loss and gastrointestinal manifestations including poor feeding gastroesophageal reflux and or constipation recurrent facial and physical characteristics included hypotonic facies with an open mouth brachycephaly long and flat malar region posteriorly rotated ears broad nasal tip flat nasal bridge short philtrum thin vermillion border downturned corners of the mouth high arched palate and pointed chin an overview of clinical features is presented in table pictures of the five patients are shown in fig to date seven de novo mutations leading to premature termination of pogz have been identified in cohorts of individuals with diverse ndds including asd n id n dd n or schizophrenia n the truncating variants result in termination of the protein prior to or within the c terminal dde and or coiled coil domains additionally a de novo missense mutation in the cenp b like dna binding domain of pogz was also reported in a child with asd id and dysmorphic features we identified five patients with heterozygous truncating mutations in pogz four of the five variants were confirmed to be de novo in the affected individual the father of patient was unavailable for analysis but his mother did not harbor the pogz variant extensive testing for each of these individuals was negative with the exception of a paternally inherited missense variant in rai in patient of uncertain clinical significance and compound heterozygous variants of uncertain clinical significance in stil in patient we identified heterozygous truncating variants in pogz in all five individuals by wes these five variants were validated by sanger sequencing publicly available databases including aric and the exome aggregation consortium exac version cambridge ma usa http exac broadinstitute org confirmed that the identified variants are unique to our patients table provides a molecular description of variants identified in these five patients and eight previously identified cases indels resulting in frameshift mutations were present in three of five patients and two of five contained nonsense mutations one transition and one transversion three of the five variants occur in the final exon of pogz and can potentially escape nonsense mediated decay however the two patients with variants predicted to be subject to degradation by nonsense mediated decay do not have distinguishing phenotypic features from the three terminal exon containing patients all five truncating mutations are predicted to result in the loss of greater than amino acids at the c terminus of pogz loss of this region of the protein is predicted by conceptual translation to result in deletion of the cenp b like dna binding domain the dde domain and the coiled coil domain thus the mutations present in each of the five individuals in this study likely result in loss of function the assertion that heterozygous loss of function mutations in pogz cause diverse ndds is further supported by the presence of two cnvs encompassing pogz coding regions in the decipher database the two individuals with small deletions of pogz are phenotypically described as having dd and additional significant developmental and morphological phenotypes large cohort studies have associated truncating mutations in pogz with behavioral abnormalities id and dd the identification of numerous candidate genes in these studies highlights their value however to thoroughly describe the clinically relevant phenotypes associated with mutation in a given gene targeted analyses of a molecularly defined cohort are required here we utilized a genotype first approach to identify shared facial and physical characteristics as well as the spectrum of individual phenotypes resulting from deleterious mutations in pogz we identified five patients with novel truncating mutations in pogz likely resulting in loss of function alleles the description of the five individuals and a review of eight patients from the literature indicate that individuals with mutations in pogz are likely to have global dd microcephaly id strabismus and variable hearing loss comparison of facial and physical characteristics in our five subjects has revealed shared facial features including brachycephaly long and flat malar region broad nasal tip short philtrum thin vermillion border downturned corners of the mouth and pointed chin patients also present with highly variable neurobehavioral phenotypes ranging from asd to severe aggressive behaviors similar to what is seen in individuals with smith magenis syndrome table it is possible that patient and patient may have a blended phenotype patient has a paternally inherited missense mutation in rai which is associated with smith magenis syndrome in addition to the characteristic features patient also presented with congenital abnormalities including diaphragmatic hernia a renal tract anomaly and heart defects other than the de novo pogz mutation we did not identify additional molecular events that would account for her phenotype therefore although it is possible that pogz truncating mutations could lead to clinical phenotypes including mild congenital abnormalities an additional unidentified cause in patient could potentially be responsible for her uncharacteristic presentations together our data and a literature review indicate that damaging variants in pogz result in a broad range of features distinguished by global dd id neurobehavioral abnormalities most often asd short stature hypotonia strabismus characteristic facial features including brachycephaly long and flat malar region broad nasal tip short philtrum thin vermillion border downturned corners of the mouth and pointed chin and variable hearing loss pogz has not been extensively characterized the protein product contains eight canonical c h like zinc finger domains that are implicated in protein protein interactions and have the potential for dna interactions the c terminus of the protein contains a b like centromere binding domain and a dde domain interestingly pogz interacts with hp via the zinc finger domain this activates aurora b kinase indicating a potential role for pogz in mitotic progression and neuronal differentiation similar to pogz many genes encoding proteins required for proper centrosomal function or chromosome segregation are mutated in patients with microcephaly demonstrating a common theme of aberrant neuronal proliferation and migration pogz is expressed in developing cortical projection neurons which have been implicated in a network convergence of neurodevelopmental risk genes hp also strongly interacts with nipbl which is mutated in individuals with cornelia de lange syndrome the overlapping molecular networks of pogz and nipbl may indicate common mechanisms of transcriptional dysregulation with deleterious mutation of these genes although ndds are typically a clinical diagnosis molecular genetic testing including both acgh and wes is capable of more precisely defining syndromes and disorders with highly variable phenotypes with the expanding number of single gene candidates for ndds and the variability of these phenotypes wes was crucial in defining the cohort of five patients presented here the increasing emergence of candidate genes for various disorders necessitates genotype driven approaches for describing associated phenotypic spectrums furthermore with a better understanding of the clinical presentations of patients with deleterious pogz mutations more molecular diagnoses may be forthcoming we report the detailed phenotypic features associated with loss of function variants in pogz these include a broad range of features distinguished by global dd microcephaly id neurobehavioral abnormalities including asd short stature hypotonia strabismus and variable hearing loss we also describe characteristic facial features of this disorder that include brachycephaly long and flat malar region broad nasal tip short philtrum thin vermillion border downturned corners of the mouth and pointed chin identification of pogz variants and subsequent description of characteristic clinical presentations demonstrate the utility of human reverse genetics in an era of personal genome analyses and clinical genomics
 de novo mutations in arid b associated with both syndromic and non syndromic short stature human height is a complex trait with a strong genetic basis recently a significant association between rare copy number variations cnvs and short stature has been identified and candidate genes in these rare cnvs are being explored this study aims to evaluate the association between mutations in arid b gene and short stature both the syndromic and non syndromic form based on a case control study of whole genome chromosome microarray analysis cma three overlapping cnvs were identified in patients with developmental disorders who exhibited short stature arid b a causal gene for coffin siris syndrome is the only gene encompassed by all three cnvs a following retrospective genotype phenotype analysis based on a literature review confirmed that short stature is a frequent feature in those coffin siris syndrome patients with arid b mutations mutation screening of arid b coding regions was further conducted in a cohort of non syndromic short stature patients andfour novel missense variants including two de novo mutations were found these results suggest that haploinsufficient mutations of arid b are associated with syndromic short stature including coffin siris syndrome and intellectual disability while rare missense variants in arid b are associated with non syndromic short stature this study supports the notion that mutations in genes related to syndromic short stature may exert milder effect and contribute to short stature in the general population the online version of this article doi s contains supplementary material which is available to authorized users keywords arid b short stature haploinsufficiency coffin siris syndrome chromatin remodeling human height is a quantitative trait that follows a gaussian distribution short stature is typically defined as a height more than standard deviations sd below the corresponding mean height for a given age gender and ethnic population individuals with short stature include those at the tail of the normal distribution not necessary associated with any disorders as well as individuals with rare disorders that restrict growth genome wide association studies gwas have identified over independent loci associated with height in the general population which collectively explain of the variation in adult height rare variants with larger effects have been found in a number of genes leading to syndromic short stature disorders for example the shox gene was identified as the gene responsible for short stature in turner syndrome and leri weill syndrome recently we demonstrated a significant association between low frequent copy number deletions and short stature supporting the hypothesis that rare haploinsufficient genes play significant roles in human growth we further demonstrated that an increased burden of rare deletions may also contribute to short stature in a non clinically ascertained population underscoring the concept that milder defects in genes known to cause syndromic short stature may contribute to short stature in the general population in this study we focus on a recurrent cnv detected in patients with short stature we propose that the arid b gene which is the only gene intercepted by three cnvs is a novel short stature gene we provide additional evidence supporting that arid b mutations are associated with both syndromic and non syndromic short stature whole genome microarray agilent k was performed to detect structural variants in a clinical cohort subjects were eligible if they had a height measurement recorded between the ages of and years and had a chromosomal microarray performed as part of their clinical evaluation all information was obtained with appropriate consent from boston children's hospital m subjects with aneuploidy and poor microarray quality were not included leaving a final sample size of individuals including patients with short stature patients with tall stature and patients with normal stature all cnv data were called with nexus software biodiscovery el segundo california the recurrent copy number variations involving arid b gene were validated by multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification mlpa mlpa probe and reagents from mrc holland salsa mlpa p arid a arid b probemix data analysis and visualization was done on coffalyzer software a cnv is defined as non benign when it does not overlap with cnv reported in dgv database of genomic variants or overlaps with cnv with less than population frequency in dgv non benign recurrent or overlapping cnvs were identified in the subjects with short stature and compared to their occurrence in normal stature population the ucsc genome browser's custom track was used to depict the overlapping nature of cnvs and to delineate the minimal region of overlap mro we identified a total of individuals carrying arid b deletions or mutations from a pubmed search and the decipher database of them had information on height we converted all height parameters available to z scores based on cdc growth charts http www cdc gov growthcharts zscore htm forty eight non syndromic short stature chinese patients were recruited in shanghai children's medical center their age gender and height information are included in additional file the inclusion criteria were individuals with height below rd percentile without a clinical diagnosis of intellectual disability or developmental delay all information was obtained with appropriate consent based on requirements of shanghai children's medical center scmc irb k subjects were randomly selected in non syndromic short stature patients since it is unclear yet if arid b affects hormone related pathways we did not use hormonal status as a criteria for subject selection genomic dna was extracted from peripheral blood of all participants using qiaamp blood dna mini kit mutation screening for all coding regions of arid b were done by polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification followed by sanger sequencing sequence variants were evaluated with mutation surveyor soft genetics state college pa and their potential functional impact was predicted using insilico prediction programs including sift polyphen condel and align gvgd paternity tests were performed with short tandem repeat str markers for the two probands with de novo variants using ampflstr identifiler pcr amplification kit the study was reviewed and approved by the scmc ethical committee and all participants or their parents signed an informed consent form in addition we compared the variant frequency in the arid b coding regions detected by exome sequencing to that of normal chinese controls the normal chinese controls were age and gender matching chinese individuals of normal height weight and were recruited from multiple geographic areas for an effort to create a common sequence variants database of normal chinese children four thousand four hundred eleven individuals in the clinical population met our inclusion criteria as described in methods including patients with short stature patients with tall stature and patients with normal stature three individuals with copy number variants encompassing arid b were identified among patients with short stature who underwent clinical microarray analysis at boston children's hospital the locations of the two deletions and one duplication in relation to the arid b gene are shown in fig red tracks indicate deletion and blue track indicates duplication the numbers associated with each track are the z scores of patient's height the first patient patient a carries a kb de novo deletion at q which affected only arid b the second patient patient b carries a mb de novo deletion at q q which overlaps with the deletion in patient the height z score for both patients are and respectively the patient with the duplication patient c was a year old caucasian girl who carries a kb maternally inherited intragenic duplication at q her height z score was the mother's height is below average z but not short in addition to short stature all three patients exhibited language impairment facial malformation and intellectual disability thus all three patients exhibited syndromic short stature detailed clinical phenotypes and their growth curves can be found in additional files there were no cnvs involving arid b in patients with normal stature and patients with tall stature in our clinical population a total of patients with mutations in arid b including translocation deletion duplication nonsense and truncating mutations have been described in the literature and decipher database many of whom have coffin siris syndrome we summarize the available clinical features of these patients in table five patients had no height information out of the remaining patients had short stature of patients have height z scores below sd none of the patients had height z scores above sd the average available z score among patients with mutations in arid b is sd thus growth retardation and short stature is a common feature associated with mutations in arid b and coffin siris syndrome we sequenced the coding regions and intron exon boundaries of arid b in non syndromic short stature chinese patients we detected four missense variants variants c c t and c c t in patients d and e respectively were inherited from their fathers and the c variant was present in a sister of normal height as well variants c g c and c g t in patients f and g were not identified in either parent paternity test confirmed the biological relationship between the probands and their parents data available in additional file thus these two missense variants are de novo changes in the probands provocative growth hormone gh testing with intravenous infusion of arginine and oral administration of clonidine was performed in the patients following routine procedures patient e f and g exhibited partial growth hormone deficiency by provocative gh testing ng ml patient d had a normal growth hormone level ng ml none of them had intellectual disability or language impairment thus they are all considered to have non syndromic short stature detailed clinical information of the four patients is presented in additional file the four missense variants were all predicted to be deleterious by sift polyphen and condel additional file they were novel variants and absent from chinese controls the nhlbi exome variant server dataset http evs gs washington edu evs and the exac database http exac broadinstitute org we detected novel variants predicted to be deleterious in chinese controls there is a significant enrichment of novel deleterious missense variants detected in short stature patients when compared to the normal chinese controls p fisher exact test it is unclear if the inherited variants in patients d and e are pathogenic given the lack of segregation with short stature in the family partial penetrance of these two inherited variants are possible based on the recently published guideline for variant interpretation the two de novo variants are classified as likely pathogenic and the other two variants are of uncertain significance see additional file high resolution array cgh enables the detection of small cnvs involving one gene or part of a gene this approach allowed for the identification of candidate short stature genes we scanned the whole genome for single cnvs in individual patients or overlapping cnvs with a single gene in the region of overlap in patients with short stature we paid particular attention to de novo cnvs only present in patients and not in a control population by this approach we identified a chromatin remodeling gene arid b as a novel short stature gene arid b was the only gene in the region of overlap involving two deletions and one duplication the two deletions were de novo arid b has been identified as one of the causal genes for coffin siris syndrome and it has also been associated with syndromic intellectual disability while growth retardation was mentioned as one of the features of coffin sirissyndrome this feature is currently under appreciated we then performed a comprehensive case review of the clinical features of all individuals carrying mutation in arid b regardless of their associated syndromes table this genotype driven approach revealed a significant association between short stature and mutations in arid b next we further explored the possible contribution of arid b mutations to non syndromic short stature by screening short stature patients who did not have developmental delay or intellectual disability as a result we identified four novel missense variants in arid b including two de novo variants the likelihood of a chance finding of two de novo variants in the same gene in individuals is extremely small indicating that these variants are likely causal of the patients' short stature collectively our data support the notion that arid b mutations cause growth retardation in syndromic patients and may also contribute to non syndromic short stature recently loss of function mutations in arid b were identified as causative for coffin siris syndrome a rare genetic condition characterized by growth deficiency developmental delay severe speech impairment intellectual disability and specific physical features including microcephaly coarse facial features hypertrichosis hypoplastic or absent fifth fingernails or toenails and hypoplasia or agenesis of the corpus callosum our patient a exhibited many features of coffin siris but was not noted to have hypoplastic or absent fifth fingernails or toenails our patient b showed typical signs of coffin siris syndrome but not patient c all three patients exhibited short stature we performed a comprehensive review on published cases with loss of function mutations in arid b table based on the available clinical information from the published literature all patients showed developmental delay and language impairment most of patients exhibited hypertonia seizures agenesis of corpus callosum autism or autistic features as well as dysmorphic features low set or abnormal shaped ears prominent nose various eye related features hypertrichosis coarse face abnormal head shape low hair line and spinal skeletal anomalies patients ascertained with coffin siris syndrome also exhibited dysplastic nails case review data showed that of patients with arid b mutations had short stature defined as height below sd the majority had a height z score below and none of the patients had above average height the average z score among patients for whom height data was available is thus growth retardation and short stature is a common feature associated with mutations in arid b and coffin siris syndrome coffin siris syndrome is a nucleosome remodeling complex swi snf swi disorder mutations in other genes involved with the swi snf complex such as arid a smarca smarca smarcb and smarce are also responsible for coffin siris syndrome recent genotype phenotype analysis indicated that short stature is a prominent feature in patients carrying mutations in those other swi snf genes as well among all the coffin siris syndrome patients detected with mutations in those baf complex related genes brg brm associated factor of them showed short stature additionally of coffin siris patients without identified mutations presented with short stature thus short stature is a common feature of coffin siris syndrome we identified four novel missense variants among individuals with idiopathic short stature not associated with developmental delay these variants were not reported in genomes project database dbsnp database the esp dataset or exac database functional predictions suggest deleterious effect on protein for all four variants although two of the variants were found in family members without short stature all four variants were absent from ethnically matched controls we found significantly fewer deleterious novel missense variants in age gender and ethnicity matched controls than in short stature patients importantly two of the variants were de novo changes not detected in parents and non affected siblings all four patients carrying arid b mutation showed no signs of coffin siris syndrome or developmental or mental deficits arid b de novo mutations have been shown to contribute to the heritable complex traits such as autism spectrum disorders asds although the effect size may be small we have not established the causal relationship between these mutations and short stature but we postulate that arid b is also involved with idiopathic short stature in a similar manner almost all syndromic individuals carried loss of function arid b mutations which include genic deletions n genic duplications n nonsense mutations n frame shift mutations n and a translocation n on the other hand all variants identified in non syndromic short stature are missense variants based on this finding we postulate that while complete loss of the arid b gene product causes a syndrome that involves developmental delay intellectual disability dysmorphism and short stature missense mutations may cause isolated short stature without developmental defects further testing of more non syndromic short stature patient is warranted to validate such hypothesis in order to evaluate the association of arid b mutations with syndromic and non syndromic short stature we collected data from a total of patients who underwent clinical microarray testing at boston children's hospital non syndromic short stature patients at shanghai children's medical center and patients reported in the literature with arid b gene mutations by case control study retrospective genotype phenotype analysis and arid b gene mutation screening we found haploinsufficient mutations of arid b are associated with syndromic short stature in coffin sirissyndromeor patients with intellectual disability arid b mutations are also found to be associated with non syndromic short stature this finding supports the notion that chromatin remodeling genes play an important role in human height regulation
 de novo frameshift mutation in asxl in a patient with global developmental delay microcephaly and craniofacial anomalies currently diagnosis of affected individuals with rare genetic disorders can be lengthy and costly resulting in a diagnostic odyssey and in many patients a definitive molecular diagnosis is never achieved despite extensive clinical investigation the recent advent and use of genomic medicine has resulted in a paradigm shift in the clinical molecular genetics of rare diseases and has provided insight into the causes of numerous rare genetic conditions in particular whole exome and genome sequencing of families has been particularly useful in discovering de novo germline mutations as the cause of both rare diseases and complex disorders we present a six year old nonverbal african american female with microcephaly autism global developmental delay and metopic craniosynostosis exome sequencing of the patient and her two parents revealed a heterozygous two base pair de novo deletion c _ delca p gln valfsx in asxl predicted to result in a frameshift at codon with substitution of a valine for a glutamine and introduction of a premature stop codon we provide additional evidence that truncating and frameshifting mutations in the asxl gene are the cause of a newly recognized disorder characterized by severe global developmental delay short stature microcephaly and craniofacial anomalies furthermore we expand the knowledge about disease causing mutations and the genotype phenotype relationships in asxl and provide evidence that rare nonsynonymous damaging mutations are not associated with developmental delay or microcephaly keywords asxl bohring opitz syndrome global developmental delay microcephaly craniofacial anomalies de novo frameshift exome sequencing obtaining a molecular diagnosis for many rare diseases can be an arduous task the process is often hindered by the rarity of conditions which is further exacerbated by the clinical heterogeneity genetic heterogeneity genocopies and phenocopies that rare diseases tend to exhibit frequently this results in a process that has been termed the diagnostic odyssey the nih office of rare diseases research reported that it took to years to reach a proper diagnosis for of patients with rare disorders and more than years for of these patients the recent advent and use of genomic medicine has resulted in a paradigm shift in the clinical molecular genetics of rare diseases from phenotype driven diagnosis to genotype driven diagnosis and has provided insight into the causes of numerous rare genetic conditions briefly genomic medicine defined as the structured approach to disease discovery diagnosis and management that prominently features next generation sequencing and analysis at a genome scale has provided the impetus for a paradigm shift in the clinical evaluation of rare diseases to identify underlying molecular genetic causes whole exome and genome sequencing of families has been particularly useful in discovering de novo germline mutations as the cause of both rare diseases and complex disorders for example de novo mutations have recently been associated with multiple rare diseases including rare growth disorders characterized by megalencephaly due to mutations in three genes akt pik r pik ca and baraitser winter syndrome characterized by brain malformations due to de novo mutations in the actin genes actb and actg we recently described a de novo mutation in mtor as a cause of megalencephaly and intractable seizures smith et al submitted in addition new research has implicated de novo mutations in the complex disorders of autism and schizophrenia first described in bohring optiz syndrome bos omim has recently been shown through the use of next generation exome sequencing to be due to de novo heterozygous mutations in the additional sex combs like gene asxl two further cases of de novo mutations in asxl in patients with bos supported the disease gene association and gave limited insight into genotype phenotype relationships prior to this the presence of seven of ten features were needed for a clinical diagnosis trigonocephaly microcephaly flammeus nevus prominent eyes micro or retrognathia abnormal palate typical bos posture feeding difficulties intrauterine growth restriction iugr and severe profound learning difficulties here we report on the use of exome sequencing of a proband with considerable overlap with the bos phenotype and her parents to discover a heterozygous frame shift variant in the additional sex combs like asxl gene asxl is in the same gene family as asxl and mutations in asxl appear to be associated with a disorder that is paralogous to bos the proband is a year old african american female cmh with microcephaly autism global developmental delay and metopic craniosynostosis figure she was born at weeks gestation following a pregnancy complicated by insulin dependent diabetes with maternal blood sugar lability throughout pregnancy the patient's mother was a year old gravida para female with a history of first trimester miscarriage there was no exposure to alcohol tobacco or drugs delivery was via cesarean section for breech presentation at birth the proband had a weight of kg for gestational age length cm for gestational age and occipitofrontal circumference cm for gestational age apgar scores were and at one and five minutes respectively however on the first day of life she was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit nicu for hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia family history was notable for a maternal half sister with type diabetes mellitus who also had a history of hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemic seizures in infancy but who has normal cognitive functioning the mother also had a history of hypoglycemia in childhood that evolved to insulin dependent diabetes mellitus the mother is otherwise healthy and has no history of learning problems the patient's father has hypertension but is otherwise healthy in the first months of life the patient was hospitalized times for vomiting hypoglycemia failure to thrive and episodic irritability blood glucose was labile ranging from mg dl reference range mg dl she had two hypoglycemic seizures a sulfonylurea receptor defect was suspected because of the blood sugar lability in the proband sister and mother molecular testing of the proband and her mother identified a shared novel variant in the abcc atp binding cassette subfamily member gene c g a p val met that was considered to be consistent with a diagnosis of familial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia type hhf omim she was therefore placed on diazoxide a gastrostomy tube and a peripherally inserted central catheter picc line were placed for nutrition and glucose stabilization by months length and weight were between the th percentiles but head circumference was below the rd percentile she was hypotonic and hyperreflexic she had dysmorphic facial features including a sloping forehead with metopic ridging a flat nasal bridge wide set eyes and slightly posteriorly rotated ears the nose had a short columella and hypoplastic alae nasae nasolabial folds were smooth and the upper lip had a prominent cupid's bow she had no other dysmorphic features developmental milestones were delayed at months she could army crawl had inconsistent visual attention and was nonverbal she had episodic irritability with fits of screaming lasting hours self injurious behavior and very poor sleep she developed repetitive movements predominately lateral head shaking developmental testing demonstrated delay on the cognitive adaptive test her visual motor problem solving quotient was mean sd on the clinical linguistic and auditory milestone scale language quotient was mean sd brain mri demonstrated mild white matter loss with enlarged lateral ventricles and mild prominence of the sulci brain spectroscopy was normal a head ct confirmed suspected metopic synostosis surgical correction of synostosis resulted in less irritability but did not affect development an echocardiogram was notable for mild pulmonary artery stenosis an aortopulmonary collateral vessel and a small patent foramen ovale because of the differences in her development and phenotype from those of her mother and sister who share the hhf diagnosis additional genetic testing was obtained karyotype microarray fmr gene analysis mecp sequencing and mecp deletion duplication testing were normal she remained nonverbal microcephalic and globally delayed with repetitive motor behaviors and was diagnosed with autism she began to walk at around years of age through age she continued to be a diagnostic enigma several but not all of these features have been reported in bos table at age the proband and her parents were enrolled in an undiagnosed disease program at the children's mercy hospital in which trios undergo a research exome sequencing study briefly dna isolated from peripheral blood cells was enriched for all coding exons utr and promoter regions in more than characterized genes using the illumina truseq exome enrichment kit and sequenced x base pairs on an illumina hiseq instrument additional file methods alignment and variant characterization were conducted as stated in the supplement and previously described the patient's exome was analysed as a trio two healthy parents and one affected child for potential mitochondrial de novo dominant and autosomal recessive causes of disease zero rare defined as frequency of or less in dbsnp v the genomes project or cpgm internal variant database likely pathogenic mitochondrial variants were discovered however cmh was found to be heterozygous for two apparent de novo mutations a nonsynonymous de novo mutation in vax c c g p ile met and a two base pair de novo deletion c _ delca p gln valfsx in asxl predicted to result in a frameshift at codon with substitution of a valine for a glutamine and introduction of a premature stop codon amino acids downstream were discovered additional file figure s the asxl deletion was seen in of reads covering the region in cmh but not observed in the mother cmh or father cmh despite adequate sequence coverage at that nucleotide additional file figure s heterozygous de novo truncating variants in asxl have recently been reported in patients with a novel clinical phenotype similar to bohring opitz syndrome and are consistent with this patient's clinical findings table in addition two rare nonsynonymous compound heterozygous mutations were also discovered in lyst c c g p asp glu c c t p leu phe after expert review the variants in vax and lyst were deemed unlikely to be pathogenic as the patient did not fit clinical or genetic descriptions of syndromic microphthalmia type omim which is an autosomal recessive disorder with prominent microphtalmia not seen in our patient or chediak higashi syndrome omim a primary immunodeficiency with partial albinism leaving the de novo mutation in asxl as the highest candidate disease causing mutation of note analysis of asxl revealed two non pathogenic inherited variants and zero de novo mutations ruling out bohring optiz syndrome the asxl mutation was confirmed by capillary sequencing in a clinical lab prior to reporting to the family additional file figure s to better understand the rare nonsynonymous variant burden and impact of mutations in the asxl gene we examined the number of variants of a frequency of less than in the asxl gene in the cpgm internal variant database this database collates every variant detected at the cpgm including the frequency of occurrence and associated clinical phenotypes the database contains children with suspected rare genetic disorders as well as healthy unaffected family members in the more than exomes sequenced at the cpgm the proband is the only patient with a heterozygous frameshift mutation in asxl predicting a truncated gene product however there are single nucleotide variants of with a frequency of less than percent in our database additional file table s characterization of these rare variants revealed that were predicted to deleterious by sift sorts intolerant from tolerant substitutions and predicted to be probably or possibly damaging by polyphen polymorphism phenotyping phenotypic evaluation of the samples with these rare non synonymous variants revealed no patients with developmental delay microcephaly or other craniofacial anomalies suggesting that these variants are unlikely to be pathogenic in a heterozygous state in this study we provide the second report and fifth patient with pathogenic mutations in asxl our case provides additional evidence that indeed truncating frameshift mutations in the asxl gene are the cause of a newly recognized distinct disorder characterized by global developmental delay and craniofacial anomalies that shares significant clinical features with bohring opitz syndrome our patient cmh exhibited multiple overlapping clinical features of bos most notably trigonocephaly microcephaly feeding difficulties and severe learning difficulties table unlike the previously reported cases with asxl mutations our patient had trigonocephaly thus the lack of trigoncephaly may not be a useful in differentiating bos from this newly recognized condition to date none of the five patients described with asxl mutations has displayed the typical bos posture whereas percent of the described patients with asxl mutations did suggesting that this feature might be useful in discriminating between the two related conditions the mutation in our patient was at amino coding position which is closest to subject reported by bainbridge et al _ del in contrast to subject however cmh exhibited a severe phenotype with feeding difficulties growth restriction and severe global developmental delay both the mutation described here and that of the previously described subject occur in an evolutionarily conserved serine rich motif found between residues the considerable clinical variability between our patient and that of subject emphasize the need for additional studies of the complex phenotype genotype associations in this disorder and the paralogous disorder bos the diagnosis of hhf due to mutation in abcc in this patient likely contributed to her recurring hospitalizations and growth difficulties and may have impacted her early development importantly the abcc variant c g a p val met was also identified by the whole exome sequencing labile maternal blood glucose during pregnancy was also considered in the early differential of her developmental delay however both the mother and sister of the proband share hhf diagnosis and have histories of severe hypoglycemia and with resultant episodes of altered mental status and seizures in early childhood both have normal cognitive functioning and achieved normal growth parameters to date all reported potential pathogenic mutations in asxl have been either frameshifting or truncating to further examine the variant burden in asxl and the genotype phenotype relationship we utilized our clinical grade variant database with more than exomes to evaluate rare variation defined as present in less than of samples in the asxl gene unlike what has been reported in other large scale databases our internal warehouse does not contain samples with truncating nonsense mutations however we did uncover rare single nucleotide variants snvs additional file table s asxl is nucleotides long and composed of exons with the ' exons and being disproportionately large comprising and nucleotides respectively the vast majority of the variants from our database were in exon which included our de novo deletion or exon additional file table s interestingly although our database contains samples with neurodevelopmental disorders none of the discovered rare variants were in any of these patients suggesting that these variants are unlikely to be pathogenic in a heterozygous state and providing additional support that only frameshifting or truncating mutations in asxl are pathogenic however additional functional studies to investigate the pathogenicity of asxl variants are needed to completely conclude that snvs are expected to be nonpathogenic in summary we describe the use of familial exome sequencing to discover a de novo framshift mutation in the asxl gene in a patient with feeding difficulties microcephaly severe global developmental delay and craniofacial anomalies furthermore we provide additional evidence that heterozygous frameshift truncating mutations in asxl are the cause of a newly recognized disorder in addition we expand the knowledge about disease causing mutations and the genotype phenotype relationships in asxl and provide evidence that rare nonsynonymous and predicted damaging mutations are not associated with developmental delay or microcephaly rather that pathogenic are likely to be either frameshifting or truncating
 targeted resequencing in epileptic encephalopathies identifies de novo mutations in chd and syngap epileptic encephalopathies are a devastating group of epilepsies with a poor prognosis for which the majority have unknown etiology we perform targeted massively parallel resequencing of known and candidate epileptic encephalopathy genes in patients to identify novel genes and investigate the phenotypic spectrum of known genes overall we identify pathogenic mutations in of our cohort six of the candidate genes had one or more pathogenic variants collectively accounting for of our cohort we show that de novo chd and syngap mutations are novel causes of epileptic encephalopathies accounting for and of cases respectively we also further expand the phenotypic spectrum for scn a scn a and scn a mutations to our knowledge this is the largest cohort of patients with epileptic encephalopathies to undergo targeted resequencing implementation of this rapid and efficient method will change diagnosis and understanding of the molecular etiologies of these disorders epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders with a lifetime incidence of epileptic encephalopathies are a devastating group of epilepsies characterized by refractory seizures and cognitive arrest or regression associated with ongoing epileptic activity and typically carry a poor prognosis de novo mutations in several known genes are responsible for some epileptic encephalopathies furthermore we and others have shown that rare de novo copy number variants cnvs account for up to of cases despite this recent progress making a genetic diagnosis in a patient can be challenging as there is both genetic heterogeneity for a given epilepsy syndrome and phenotypic heterogeneity for a specific gene the full phenotypic spectrum associated with mutations in known epileptic encephalopathy genes is not known very few studies have investigated the role of any given gene across a wide spectrum of epileptic encephalopathy syndromes this makes serial gene testing in the clinical setting an inefficient and expensive process after which the vast majority of cases remain unexplained furthermore it is clear that discovery of additional genes that cause epileptic encephalopathies is needed to facilitate genetic diagnosis here we take advantage of a high throughput targeted sequencing approach to perform comprehensive sequence analysis of genes known genes and candidate genes in patients with a range of epileptic encephalopathy phenotypes table candidate genes were selected from epilepsy associated cnvs n or because mutations cause associated neurodevelopmental disorders or other epilepsy syndromes n using this approach we i identify novel epileptic encephalopathy genes and ii delineate the phenotypic spectrum and mutation frequency for both known and novel epileptic encephalopathy genes overall of the target genes was sequenced at x coverage required for accurate variant calling we achieved sensitivity across variants loci from samples that had previously undergone exome sequencing and sensitivity for known variants in previously tested patients these patients were not included in the discovery cohort we detected one or more pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations in six of our candidate genes with multiple individuals carrying mutations in either of the two novel epileptic encephalopathy genes chd nm_ np_ and syngap nm_ np_ remarkably we detected six de novo variants in the candidate gene chd fig selected from within the critical interval of q deletions detected in patients with a range of epileptic encephalopathies four mutations lead to premature truncation of chd table two de novo missense variants disrupt highly conserved residues within the snf related helicase atpase domain p trp arg and p leu pro and are predicted to be damaging by both polyphen and sift chd codes for a member of the chromodomain helicase dna binding family of proteins and is characterized by the presence of chromatin remodeling chromo chromatin organization modifier and snf related helicase atpase domains these domains suggest function of this protein as a chromatin remodeler while functional studies in chd are limited studies of another chd protein family member chd have shown that the helicase domain is responsible for atp dependent nucleosome remodeling an integral process in target gene regulation furthermore in vivo studies of human chd mutations within the helicase domain which cause charge syndrome resulted in decreased remodeling ability these results suggest that the two de novo missense mutations described here may disrupt chd function in a similar manner while truncating mutations likely result in haploinsufficiency the six patients with chd mutations had distinctive features with a median seizure onset of months range years table myoclonic seizures in all photosensitivity in three and all had id ranging from moderate to severe a de novo chd frameshift mutation was reported in a proband with id and absence seizures and a de novo missense mutation in an individual with autism spectrum disorder asd these results suggest that mutations in chd contribute to a broad spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders notably recent studies implicate de novo mutations in chd in patients with asd interestingly three genes of the chromodomain family chd chd chd have now been implicated in disorders that impact the neurodevelopmental system further studies of this nine member gene family will determine the role of each across the spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders and provide exciting new avenues of research we identified nine pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in four of the epilepsy associated' genes we found five truncating variants in syngap patients with syngap mutations had median seizure onset of months mean months range months to years table they had multiple seizure types early developmental delay and subsequent regression outcome was poor with moderate to severe id syngap mutations have been associated with id and although most patients have epilepsy seizures are typically well controlled our study represents the first cases of epileptic encephalopathies with syngap mutations these observations suggest that epilepsy is a core feature of both static and progressive encephalopathies associated with syngap mutations and carry important implications for diagnostic testing variants were identified in three additional epilepsy associated genes' there were two de novo variants in mef c nm_ np_ a missense variant and a stop loss variant p serext furthermore we found de novo pathogenic variants in mbd nm_ np_ thr glnfs and gabrg nm_ np_ p arg gln table we detected a premature truncation mutation p tyr in the cnv candidate gene hnrnpu nm_ np_ the p tyr change arose as a result of two consecutive single nucleotide changes c t c and c a t that occur two amino acids upstream of the termination codon neither variant was maternally inherited paternal dna was not available a recent report identified hnrnpu as a candidate for the id and seizure phenotypes of probands with q microdeletions in addition a de novo splice site variant was identified in a proband with a complex neurodevelopmental phenotype including epilepsy collectively these data suggest that haploinsufficiency of hnrnpu is associated with epileptic encephalopathy as well as id though further phenotype genotype correlation will improve our understanding of the hnrnpu phenotypic spectrum we identified variants fulfilling our criteria for pathogenicity and an additional four variants that are likely pathogenic in ten of known epileptic encephalopathy genes fig table table we identified multiple patients with mutations in stxbp cdkl scn a scn a pcdh and kcnq accounting for of all mutation positive individuals in our cohort we detected an additional rare variants in six of these known genes for which we were unable to conduct segregation analysis it is probable that a number of these variants are also pathogenic supplementary table the phenotypes identified in patients with mutations in known genes are provided table and for some we expand the known phenotypic spectrum for example we identified a homozygous recessive missense mutation in pnkp in a single proband with unclassified epileptic encephalopathy pnkp mutations are associated with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy comprising microcephaly early onset intractable seizures and developmental delay by contrast our patient did not have microcephaly head circumference th centile or developmental delay but had normal cognition despite refractory epilepsy with multiple seizure types also three patients with scn a mutations presented with an epilepsy aphasia phenotype of which two also had fs scn a mutations are well known to be associated with genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus gefs but have not previously been reported with epilepsy aphasia syndromes it is possible that the scn a mutation is not responsible for the epilepsy aphasia syndrome but equally it could be a modifier predisposing the individual to this group of epileptic encephalopathies further work is warranted to clarify this association perhaps most effectively with exome sequencing in these patients we detected five variants in scn a which encodes the subunit of the voltage gated sodium channel to date the majority of scn a mutations have been associated with the self limited autosomal dominant syndrome of benign familial neonatal infantile seizures bfnis previously only three de novo variants have been reported in patients with epileptic encephalopathies interestingly our five cases show similar variability in the range of onset seen in bfnis with three beginning in the neonatal period hours to days and two in infancy weeks months two had relatively early offset of seizures at weeks and months the refractory nature of seizures did not correlate with intellectual outcome which ranged from mild to severe intellectual disability we conclude that scn a is an important contributor to the overall burden of epileptic encephalopathies accounting for of cases we also identified a pathogenic missense mutation p leu val in scn a to date only a single de novo scn a mutation p asn asp has been described in a proband with severe epileptic encephalopathy and sudden unexplained death in epilepsy here we describe a second patient presenting with an epileptic encephalopathy beginning at months interestingly this variant was paternally inherited though the father was shown to have somatic mosaicism mutant allele supporting its pathogenic effect as seen in other genetic encephalopathies with parental mosaicism the findings in this large series of patients with hitherto unsolved epileptic encephalopathies allows us to begin to frame the overall genetic architecture of this group of disorders we identified pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations in of our cohort with mutations in genes however this mutation rate is likely to be an underestimation of the true contribution of each gene to the overall burden of epileptic encephalopathies our cohort excluded patients with previously identified mutations and we were unable to conduct segregation analysis for a subset of variants we identified some of which are likely to be pathogenic furthermore as larger numbers of patients with mutations of specific genes are identified distinctive epileptic encephalopathy phenotypes are likely to emerge taken together with up to rare cnvs in epileptic encephalopathy patients in an earlier analysis of a subset of this series we can now collectively ascribe causality for of all epileptic encephalopathies of unknown cause the genetic heterogeneity of epileptic encephalopathies is considerable likely pathogenic variants were found in nine known or novel genes even the most commonly mutated genes in our study each account for only up to of cases notably we elucidate new genes found to be commonly mutated in epileptic encephalopathies with chd syngap and scn a accounting for of cases each a frequency similar to that of mutations in scn a stxbp and cdkl in our cohort however no mutations were seen in nine other known genes arx foxg kcnt mecp plcb slc a slc a sptan arhgef in patients these results suggest that pathogenic mutations in these genes while important are rare causes of epileptic encephalopathies each in our cohort or cause only very distinct syndromes that were not prevalent in our cohort these findings support a clinical approach to genetic diagnosis that employs large gene panels or whole exome sequencing as it will remain difficult and expensive to determine a priori the causative gene in a given patient notably mutations in syngap and chd have now been described in probands with epileptic encephalopathy id and asd phenotypes highlighting the shared genetic basis of neurodevelopmental disorders unbiased approaches such as exome or whole genome sequencing provide an avenue to gene discovery but large cohorts will be required to identify two or more patients with de novo mutations in the same gene our results show the power of targeted resequencing to screen large numbers of patients in a high throughput and cost effective manner this approach is critical to identify additional patients with mutations in genes where a single de novo mutation is identified by exome sequencing approaches to determine overall mutation frequency in a given phenotype and to describe genotype phenotype correlations applying this approach across various neurodevelopmental disorders will identify additional mutation positive patients for a specific gene and enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms this study was approved by the human research ethics committees of austin health and the university of washington probands with epileptic encephalopathies were recruited from the epilepsy clinic at austin health the practices of the investigators and by referral for epilepsy genetics research from around australia and internationally after informed consent the cohort consisted of patients with a diverse range of epileptic encephalopathy phenotypes an epileptic encephalopathy was defined as refractory seizures and cognitive slowing or regression associated with frequent ongoing epileptiform activity detailed epilepsy and medical histories were obtained together with the results of investigations including eeg and mri studies epilepsy syndromes were classified according to the organization of the international league against epilepsy commission on classification table some patients had already undergone mutation screening for specific epileptic encephalopathy genes none had been screened for all known genes patients with a previously identified disease causing mutation were excluded from this study some patients with known mutations were included as mutation positive controls but were not included in the cases in the discovery cohort furthermore patients had been previously screened for pathogenic cnvs either in the research setting n or by clinical testing n probands with pathogenic cnvs were not included in this study we selected genes for sequence analysis the known gene group included genes in which mutations are known to cause one or more epileptic encephalopathy syndromes n we also selected two sets of candidate genes for epileptic encephalopathies the first set includes epilepsy associated genes' more commonly implicated in patients with non epileptic encephalopathy forms of epilepsy chrna kcnq gabrd gabrg prickle cacnb scn b or a related neurodevelopmental disorder with epilepsy as a comorbid feature grin b mbd mef c syngap syn atp a none are an established cause of epileptic encephalopathies we also selected candidate genes primarily from epilepsy associated cnvs either from published cohorts case reports or unpublished data see supplementary note and supplementary table for candidate gene selection sixteen samples that had been previously subject to exome sequencing were included in all analyses and used to assess the sensitivity of variant calling we also included probands with a known variant in a known or candidate gene to further validate our approach we used molecular inversion probes mips to capture all exon and intron exon boundaries bp flanking of target genes refseq hg build supplementary table detailed methodology is described elsewhere briefly pooled mips were used to capture target exons from ng of each proband's dna pcr was performed using universal primers with the introduction of unique eight base barcodes on the tagged reverse primer pooled libraries were subject to massively parallel sequencing using a paired end protocol on a hiseq the libraries were prepared and sequenced in two batches comprising a total of target and target genes raw read data processing and mapping with bwa see urls was performed as described single nucleotide variant snv and indel calling and filtering was performed using the genome analysis tool kit gatk see urls variants that did not adhere to the following criteria were excluded from further analysis allele balance qual qd coverage x clustered variants window size variants were annotated with seattle seq see urls and the esp dataset see urls was used to assess variant frequency in the control population for dominant or de novo models we considered only variants not present in this control sample set for recessive candidates we considered variants with a frequency in controls of only non synonymous splice site or frameshift damaging' variants were assessed further the gatk depth of coverage tool was used to calculate overall depth of coverage for each sample at a threshold of x as well as the mean percentage across all samples of bases covered x for each gene where family members were available segregation analysis was carried out for all rare not present in esp controls possibly damaging non synonymous essential splice site or frameshift variants for all target genes this analysis was performed using a mip pick' strategy we selected and re pooled only the mips that captured the genomic sequence harboring the rare variant of interest and performed target enrichment pcr and sequencing as above for all relevant probands and family members this approach allowed us to sequence variants at very high depth and detect somatic mosaicism in parents for those rare possibly damaging variants where segregation analysis could be performed we required the variant to meet one of the following criteria to constitute a novel pathogenic variant pathogenic variants i arose de novo ii segregated with the disorder iii were inherited from a parent with somatic mosaicism or iv adhered to a recessive x linked or parent of origin mode of inheritance where applicable in certain instances we were unable to determine the inheritance of a rare variant due to the unavailability of dna from one or more parent it is likely that a subset of these variants also cause disease though here we report only those variants that are likely to lead to protein truncation i e splice site nonsense frameshift stop loss as being likely pathogenic' additionally two missense mutations in known genes stxbp scn a were interpreted to be likely pathogenic' based on the high incidence of pathogenic missense mutations in these genes which was further supported by the available parent not carrying the variant we performed microsatellite analysis using the powerplex s system promega in all parents of probands with a de novo mutation to confirm maternity and paternity
 a de novo nonsense mutation in asxl shared by siblings with bainbridge ropers syndrome two sisters ages yr and yr have been followed by our clinical genetics team for several years both girls have severe intellectual disability hypotonia seizures and distinctive craniofacial features the parents are healthy and have no other children oligo array fragile x testing and numerous single gene tests were negative all four family members underwent research exome sequencing which revealed a heterozygous nonsense mutation in asxl p r x that segregated with disease exome data and independent sanger sequencing confirmed that the variant is de novo suggesting possible germline mosaicism in one parent the p r x variant has never been observed in healthy human populations and has been previously reported as a pathogenic mutation truncating de novo mutations in asxl cause bainbridge ropers syndrome brps a developmental disorder with similarities to bohring opitz syndrome fewer than brps patients have been described in the literature to our knowledge this is the first report of the disorder in two related individuals our findings lend further support to intellectual disability absent speech autistic traits hypotonia and distinctive facial appearance as common emerging features of bainbridge ropers syndrome keywords absent speech aplasia hypoplasia of the corpus callosum autism

term after an uncomplicated pregnancy her yr old sister was born at weeks' gestation by emergency cesarean section due to fetal distress both sisters have severe intellectual disability no language autistic features hypotonia and a thin habitus they share distinctive craniofacial features including a broad prominent forehead hypertelorism downslanting palpebral fissures prominent nasal root thick eyebrows hirsutism cleft chin and strikingly prominent upper central incisors table they have a history of feeding difficulties seizures and developmental delay the parents were unaffected and there was no relevant family history the proband underwent a series of genetic tests including oligo array fragile x mecp cdkl slc a and coh all of which were negative the sibling also underwent genetic testing zeb and mecp both sisters had metabolic studies after these tests failed to provide a molecular diagnosis the family underwent research exome sequencing in the proband her affected sibling and both parents underwent exome sequencing as follows exome capture was performed using agilent sureselect v reagents according to manufacturer protocols exome libraries underwent paired end sequencing bp on an illumina hiseq instrument we generated gbp of uniquely mapped reads per sample table reads were mapped to the grch reference sequence and secondary data analysis was performed using churchill kelly et al which implements the gatk best practices workflow for alignment variant discovery and genotyping sequencing metrics are provided in supplemental table variants were called in all four samples simultaneously yielding variants of which single nucleotide variants and indels passed minimum quality filters qual family relatedness was confirmed using the king algorithm v see supplemental table manichaikul et al snpeff annovar and custom in house scripts were used to annotate snps indels with gene transcript function class damaging scores and population allele frequencies some variants mapped to the exons or splice regions of known protein coding genes after removing common variants maf in the exac esp or genomes databases we selected for further analysis all splice site frameshift and nonsense variants as well as missense variants predicted to be damaging by sift score polyphen score gerp score or cadd phred score we searched for variants consistent with recessive inheritance that were present in both patients finding no compound heterozygous variants but two homozygous recessive variants of uncertain significance described in the supplemental text and supplemental table we also searched for candidate de novo mutations and identified a candidate nonsense mutation at the same position in both patients a heterozygous nonsense variant in asxl table was present in both sisters but absent from the parents manual review of the exome data verified the variant in both patients but showed no evidence of the alternate allele in either parent supplemental fig the de novo status was independently confirmed by sanger sequencing of all four individuals supplemental fig the variant is predicted to cause a stop gain at amino acid nm_ c c t p r x at of its wild type length fig a it has never been observed in individuals in the gnomad database making it extremely rare in human populations however truncating mutations in asxl were recently reported as the cause of bainbridge ropers syndrome brps omim a disorder similar to bohring opitz syndrome which is caused by truncating mutations in asxl bainbridge et al the human gene mutation database hgmd contains nonsense frameshift asxl variants five nonsense variants and five frameshift indels reported in patients with bainbridge ropers syndrome or bohring opitz like syndrome fig b the clinvar database contains nonsense frameshift variants nonsense variants including p r x and frameshift indels all of which are reported as pathogenic or likely pathogenic fig c of note many of the pathogenic mutations reported in asxl in bohring opitz syndrome also truncate of the encoded protein fig d constraint metrics from the exac database lek et al likewise indicate that asxl is extremely intolerant of loss of function lof mutations variants expected observed pli fig e in summary this de novo nonsense mutation is present in both affected individuals absent from databases of population controls and consistent with previously reported pathogenic mutations in asxl we therefore conclude that it is pathogenic and we provide a molecular diagnosis of bainbridge ropers syndrome to the proband and her affected sibling bainbridge ropers syndrome brps was first described in when bainbridge et al reported de novo truncating mutations in four unrelated probands with feeding difficulties failure to thrive neurological abnormalities and significant developmental delay to date fewer than cases of brps have been described in the literature bainbridge et al dinwiddie et al srivastava et al balasubramanian et al kuechler et al the report by kuechler et al includes a yr old female with the p r x mutation she was not reported to have seizures supplemental table but she and both of our patients share the six most emerging hallmarks of brps severe intellectual disability poor absent speech autistic traits distinct face hypotonia and significant feeding difficulties we assess our patients for the clinical features highlighted by balasubramanian et al in supplemental table we recently diagnosed a third unrelated child at our institution suggesting that the prevalence of brps is likely to be higher than currently reported in the medical literature and the diagnosis will be made more frequently as wes is incorporated more routinely into clinical practice indeed the membership of a support group for brps families suggests that as many as patients may have been diagnosed to date m bainbridge pers comm to our knowledge this is the first report of brps caused by the same de novo mutation in two related individuals siblings although it is theoretically possible that the same mutation arose independently in two different embryos germline mosaicism in one of the parents seems a more likely explanation the family declined further testing to confirm the origin of the mutation
